1295731733778673664 2020-08-18 10:38:13 EDT <oldmantrox> @Xfinity y‚Äôall been lacking all month... this is like the fourth service outage this month, and we working from home, we can‚Äôt afford that. Tighten up
1295727725743878144 2020-08-18 10:22:17 EDT <MsIngridB> I could not get onto the app - I have been having issues for over a month at this point it‚Äôs ridiculous- I cannot have outages during exams when there is no outage in the area just in my house - currently on a 40+ min hold
1295720284469723136 2020-08-18 09:52:43 EDT <LB_maynard> Becuz it‚Äôs xfinity. I‚Äôll be playing Xbox and it‚Äôll randomly disconnect and then it‚Äôll say there is an outage then boom it‚Äôs back on
1295715529618075648 2020-08-18 09:33:50 EDT <lyfsabeach954> Hey @comcast and @Xfinity are you going to reimburse me for all the money I‚Äôm losing due to your daily outages in Cooper City??
1295703095981244419 2020-08-18 08:44:25 EDT <BrentReichow> @xfinity This MN outage was supposed to end at 0500; it‚Äôs almost 0800 and still no connection. #xfinityoutage
1295693764875497473 2020-08-18 08:07:21 EDT <emXCT> Of course I have reports due today and of course @Xfinity has an outage in my area  pic.twitter.com/fRycnWBcri
1295606837820235777 2020-08-18 02:21:56 EDT <McGaughy23> Xfinity got one more time for a damn service outageüò§
1295602978649444353 2020-08-18 02:06:35 EDT <jfn4ever> Trash company. outage every other week.
1295601395756867584 2020-08-18 02:00:18 EDT <delllssss_> I thought xfinity clipped me whole time it was an outage
1295567290524667905 2020-08-17 23:44:47 EDT <MiaLeighRenna> @Xfinity most recent update: live chat disconnected after 20 minutes with no solution to my internet outage found. Chat automatically reopens to an automated chat bot, having to start all over, AGAIN.
1295566711370977281 2020-08-17 23:42:29 EDT <Jay45365954> ‚Ä¶ at this point I feel like I‚Äôm being trolled I keep being told that this is an area wide outage by this answer machine and yet I seem to be the only person with this issue on the map. And I can‚Äôt talk to an actual human being over the phone to try to effectively handle my issue
1295565900901486597 2020-08-17 23:39:15 EDT <Jay45365954> Alright this is the same guy from earlier and I keep tweeting because I seem to be getting a better response here than the wacky automated system. I checked out the outage map and I only see my home the automated system pushed the time back to 10:42 pm then again to 2:00 am‚Ä¶
1295556006290759681 2020-08-17 22:59:56 EDT <DebbieHurtado> Hey @Xfinity @comcast @comcastcares - How can I speak to a live agent. I am currently in an outage (second today - dozen+ in recent weeks). Every number I try routes me to the same recording that ends w 'an agent can't help you until the outage is resolved. Thanks. CLICK.'
1295554893378396162 2020-08-17 22:55:31 EDT <klsteel73> @Xfinity where can I report an Internet outage?
1295553455348563968 2020-08-17 22:49:48 EDT <citizengatsby> We had an Xfinity outage for a few hours. Somehow the living room TV ended up behind, which is why my tweet is late. LOL
1295549471376334848 2020-08-17 22:33:58 EDT <katbohac> Omg @Xfinity and @comcastcares you literally just told me my internet should be back so I reboot my modem a bunch of times just for you to tell me I still have an outage‚Äî wow, this isn‚Äôt an outage it‚Äôs a denial of service. More than a day and 8 different eta for fixes. #ugh!
1295534723545137152 2020-08-17 21:35:22 EDT <Xfinity> Are you in an area outage or see any issues in your My Account app?
1295531373722247168 2020-08-17 21:22:03 EDT <bmusi00> Yes and there is an outage there has been an outage everyday since Friday!!
1295524074685435905 2020-08-17 20:53:03 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked the My Account app for info on outages in your area?
1295523200885907458 2020-08-17 20:49:35 EDT <marksolario> @Xfinity so,  again?  We have to start work and school this week.  Are we going to get this outage everyday?
1295522861784932352 2020-08-17 20:48:14 EDT <squarefan09> @WOW_WAY @WOWCare  Of the 8 days I've been with WOW, only 2.5 of those had working service. Had Xfinity before wow and had nothing really to complain about but I decided to try something new for a change. Not happy about it so far, one more outage is going to make me change ISP!
1295518271844696064 2020-08-17 20:30:00 EDT <sruddystar> My MSNBC channel gets stuck at times, or other weird outages. I‚Äôve accused Xfinity of actively screwing with my favorite channel.
1295511193994563590 2020-08-17 20:01:52 EDT <personal_caleb> Can we just file a class-action lawsuit against @Xfinity @comcast for all the fucking outages everyone, including myself, has been experiencing? This is getting fucking ridiculous, we're paying for high-speed internet, not the wi-fi equivalent to a "potato" computer!
1295509348005937152 2020-08-17 19:54:32 EDT <tcheight> My internet has been out since 9am. @WOW_WAY is the worst. This is the second outage in the last wk on top of the generally unreliable service I already receive. I‚Äôm going to see if Xfinity is available in my area ASAP.
1295505071321612288 2020-08-17 19:37:32 EDT <Xfinity> Hi. Keep an eye on your My Account app for updates on an outage in your area. You can DM us here:  https://xfin.tv/support¬† for info on credits.
1295502985838174209 2020-08-17 19:29:15 EDT <the_paulenator> @Xfinity @comcast comes through again, internet outage for@the next 4 hours, just in time to miss my team start the NBA playoffs! #monopoly #ihatecomcast
1295501962088194049 2020-08-17 19:25:11 EDT <JSelga23> @Xfinity is there an outage in my area? It‚Äôs been over an hour and I still don‚Äôt have internet service.
1295501929661923328 2020-08-17 19:25:03 EDT <OPChoudhary7> Please get wireless backup connection as well. AT&T and Comcast both have this option. We dropped Comcast and switched to AT&T in April. Comcast downtime is pathetic. Every month, at least once we had multiple hours outage.
1295499803414028289 2020-08-17 19:16:37 EDT <katbohac> @Xfinity outage going into its 23rd hour. Have had 6 different restoration times & no actual restoration. The rep said it could have been caused by the company doing upgrades & assured me when it was fixed I‚Äôd never have to deal with this issue again. #yeahright @comcastcares
1295498383055097857 2020-08-17 19:10:58 EDT <JdotRdot58> We have been historically taken advantage of by these companies. @Xfinity had an outage in my area for over an hr, why are customers not reimbursed for this? This business. If I have an outage of money that‚Äôs unacceptable right?
1295498354277773312 2020-08-17 19:10:51 EDT <RobertGordonIV> Nope. No outages in my area. Just üöÆ hardware or setup (as usual). It‚Äôs just come at the wrong time (since we‚Äôre working from home and all)...
1295496246598275074 2020-08-17 19:02:29 EDT <GOLDENUZIS> there‚Äôs an outage for xfinity rn they‚Äôre fucking up my money rn
1295495352024551427 2020-08-17 18:58:55 EDT <Get_Outta_Heere> @Xfinity @comcastcares how is there an ‚Äúoutage‚Äù in my area when my neighbors WiFi is fully functional?
1295495115620995073 2020-08-17 18:57:59 EDT <datagoon> My internet connection was stable for years, now I‚Äôm dealing with multiple outages per day.  Whatever maintenance you‚Äôve performed in the last two weeks has only made things worse, @xfinity @comcastcares. https://twitter.com/datagoon/status/1293309269148934145¬†‚Ä¶
1295492790466600961 2020-08-17 18:48:44 EDT <_joesanchez> I'm trying to get a credit today for an all day outage while I was trying to work from home.
1295490758984826880 2020-08-17 18:40:40 EDT <ATall04> @Xfinity shame! It‚Äôs been 5 hours and outage is not resolved. Did five resets and it‚Äôs not working. Schedule  call, received none. I called but all in vain
1295485384231723009 2020-08-17 18:19:19 EDT <avhiebert> @Xfinity been an outage in midtown Atlanta since 10 am this morning ... how does anyone work w/out internet
1295478754928623616 2020-08-17 17:52:58 EDT <MooreoftheMusic> PART I: I left another cable company to experience the same thing with @Xfinity - persistent service outages, reps who lie and say anything to ‚Äúappease‚Äù the customer, no concrete answers when speaking with various reps. Today, I spoke with...
1295477283558490112 2020-08-17 17:47:07 EDT <MooreoftheMusic> PART I: If any of you are thinking of getting service with @Xfinity , I‚Äôd advise you to not do so. I left one cable company to experience the same thing with @Xfinity - persistent service outages, reps who lie and say anything to ‚Äúappease‚Äù the customer, no concrete answers...
1295471424086433793 2020-08-17 17:23:50 EDT <suzy21163> Outage in the area not @h_aanz issue
1295470125467013121 2020-08-17 17:18:41 EDT <Xfinity> Sorry for the frustration. Are you seeing any outage information in your My Account app?
1295468599998644227 2020-08-17 17:12:37 EDT <amberabq> Every single day.  It‚Äôs very annoying that we have outages every day of the week. üò°
1295468192748494848 2020-08-17 17:11:00 EDT <Xfinity> Hey. Have you checked the My Account app to see if there is an outage in your area?
1295466569917771777 2020-08-17 17:04:33 EDT <coolersneakers> It‚Äôs been a whole week with texts telling me different times and days when the outage would be over but it‚Äôs still the same
1295465952725946374 2020-08-17 17:02:06 EDT <MichelangeloDA> Hey @Xfinity : your status page has reported outages in literally every western suburb of Chicago for over a week.  WTF?  I want my money back.
1295464926333501441 2020-08-17 16:58:01 EDT <Xfinity> Hey. Is there an outage reported in the My Account app?
1295464501559648263 2020-08-17 16:56:20 EDT <TheJawnJoi> This @Xfinity outage in Atlanta is ridiculous ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è it‚Äôs been all day
1295463957302513666 2020-08-17 16:54:10 EDT <CHRlS1K> another xfinity outage good fucking night
1295462934148255744 2020-08-17 16:50:06 EDT <MrShack530> Damn @Xfinity @comcast how the hell you gonna have a cable outage during the @NBA playoffs.. #dobetter
1295462463429922821 2020-08-17 16:48:14 EDT <CaliforniaZay> Another Xfinity outage. I'm really starting to hate them
1295447003577692160 2020-08-17 15:46:48 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Amber. Does your My Account app indicate that you're in an outage when you notice issues?
1295445967433392128 2020-08-17 15:42:41 EDT <amberabq> Holy Moly @Xfinity not a day goes by without an outage. This is so crazy. I wish we had more options for Internet in Albuquerque.
1295445510438830080 2020-08-17 15:40:52 EDT <day_dree> Hey @Xfinity @comcast Going on 36 hrs of internet outage.  Your recording reliably updates to say another 4 hrs until service is restored ‚Äî so that‚Äôs at least 9.5 head fakes for your customers, no service, no real estimate.    Making our jobs harder since we do them from home.
1295445247388942337 2020-08-17 15:39:49 EDT <Xfinity> Heat related power outages may be impacting your services. Our services require commercial power.  During a Public Safety Power Shutoff, Comcast services including internet and video, as well as landline and mobile services for homes and businesses, may stop functioning.
1295443597848788993 2020-08-17 15:33:16 EDT <Seaduckys13> First day of distance learning and there is an @Xfinity internet outage so I can't attend school, very epic
1295439702346960898 2020-08-17 15:17:47 EDT <AuntyAlias> Xfinity had outage in my area, Merced Heights SF,CA, that lasted for hours on Saturday. Some phone apps were not working when I did have internet access. Had to uninstall and reinstall.
1295432022396026880 2020-08-17 14:47:16 EDT <petersjs14> @xfinity another service outage in San Jose??? Why do you charge so much if you don‚Äôt work
1295428114244395015 2020-08-17 14:31:44 EDT <CJ_Gerardi> @Xfinity outage in Chicago, good thing I‚Äôm not working from home with a brief deadline coming up.
1295425492674318336 2020-08-17 14:21:19 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Luis! What's been going on with your service? Are you in an outage?
1295425422633480192 2020-08-17 14:21:03 EDT <KiranCdZ> @comcastcares Xfinity internet does not work in our area (95054: Agnew-Bassett, Cheeney area). Is there a service outage? Critical work is being hindered due to this. Please look into this.
1295423054537986056 2020-08-17 14:11:38 EDT <Xfinity> Sorry for the frustration, Robert. Have you been in an area outage during this time?
1295421675756953600 2020-08-17 14:06:09 EDT <OhhHeyyyItsJen> I‚Äôm so over this Xfinity outage
1295420205150228480 2020-08-17 14:00:19 EDT <alexclaiborne1> Me when @Xfinity is having another 4 hour internet outage within 3 weeks of the last one  https://twitter.com/alexclaiborne1/status/1288131029761511425¬†‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/Rxu3U2cHQA
1295420115433992200 2020-08-17 13:59:57 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Sally. Our team in California shared some information about the effect of the heat-related power outages on your Xfinity services here:  https://xfin.tv/2PZrxCj¬† <---
1295418210897080322 2020-08-17 13:52:23 EDT <msengupt2002> How dumb can @Xfinity @comcast be that they have created service outage when kids are taking online classes and everyone else is working from home.
1295415895184023553 2020-08-17 13:43:11 EDT <Jay45365954> I would be less ticked off if there was concise communication and no lazy work. Right after the power outage we lose our WiFi, originally an automated message said 7 am today and to not ask an actual representative the issue. Come 8:30 no WiFi, so I called again and it changes‚Ä¶
1295411390191153154 2020-08-17 13:25:17 EDT <skylerkoshy> @comcastbusiness @comcastcares is asking my full address to jeopardize me instead of fixing the problem. I think Xfinity wifi should upgrade their company computer system to identify outages in 48226. Very bad!!! #WiFi #MondayMorning #broadband #American #NewNormal #help #COVID pic.twitter.com/8sUsHVealj
1295408943712395265 2020-08-17 13:15:34 EDT <essence_me> Says there are no outages. I have not had voice or internet for about 2 hours now. I cannot stay on phone and have called multiple times not getting anyone. I have reset modem 3 times.
1295408556200599555 2020-08-17 13:14:01 EDT <bakern> @comcastcares been contacting xfinity since last week regarding new equipment. Call always ends because they say there is a ‚Äúservice outage‚Äù but everything works. It‚Äôs been almost a week with on and off outages but no issue. Trying to see if we got the wrong equipment sent to us.
1295407248810717185 2020-08-17 13:08:50 EDT <DJTwinSpin> @Xfinity I want a credit to my account for all the service outages I've been having for the past week. This is absolutely ridiculous!  What the hell am I paying you guys $118 a month for?  My kids started virtual classes last week and they can't learn because of your bad service!
1295406561146413068 2020-08-17 13:06:06 EDT <BnitaApplebum> I‚Äôve lived so many places with multiple internet providers. @Xfinity is by far the worst of them all. Internet outages multiple times a week while working from home. Switching soon üòê
1295405508677992450 2020-08-17 13:01:55 EDT <G33kyMick> Had an outage last night. I feel like I need to make a switch soon.
1295402261116583937 2020-08-17 12:49:01 EDT <burgh_fan> @Xfinity been having issues for 2 weeks with sporadic service and speeds. Ya, technically there is not an outage at my address as your website states, but when you have almost no upstream, it's basically the same as an outage (gig service isn't what it should be going down too)  pic.twitter.com/fib1TJ2aiF
1295386538826764289 2020-08-17 11:46:32 EDT <PlNKNOlZE> It‚Äôs extremely choppy. This has happened several times over the past four months since we‚Äôve started service with you guys. Outages continue to happen and internet is unstable... but there‚Äôs no outages reported. I‚Äôm confusedüò≠
1295384782772350976 2020-08-17 11:39:33 EDT <MorganDanelle_> Xfinity outage = no bueno. I‚Äôll be working late today unless the outage last all night üôÑ
1295382861663666178 2020-08-17 11:31:55 EDT <_raynatural> Wifi outage less than an hour before class starts. Thanks a lot Xfinity üòí
1295382785780326400 2020-08-17 11:31:37 EDT <Rees71> @CenturyLink, you‚Äôre fired. Only had service for three weeks. This is the 3rd multiple day outage. New @Xfinity customer coming up.
1295382366295412741 2020-08-17 11:29:57 EDT <garymusicmiller> Xfinity is back up at 11:25.  Third outage in a month.  I want a reduction on m y bill. @XFinity  https://twitter.com/WSAZirr/status/1295370706570686466¬†‚Ä¶
1295374260714823682 2020-08-17 10:57:45 EDT <jaxjan66> Another day another outage.  School starts this week and people work from home now. About 5 days in a row now since some subcontractor "upgraded the lines" in the neighborhood. This is ridiculous. @xfinity @comcast #epicfail #xfinityinternet #nointernet #downagain pic.twitter.com/6JzAuhvPs2
1295371909832609800 2020-08-17 10:48:24 EDT <ShanMChristian> So I‚Äôm over here tryna be great today and here goes xfinity with an internet outage in my area üôÑ
1295370328152190976 2020-08-17 10:42:07 EDT <jennnixon> I'm really flipping tried of the weekly internet outages from @Xfinity. Every week!!!!!! And no I'm not going to DM you. I need what I overpay you for to work!
1295363230701948928 2020-08-17 10:13:55 EDT <stewsdata> You know it's magic. I can easily cause a #xfinity system outage by asking them to cancel my account. Everytime, "Oh sorry sir, it seems my system is not working right now. We will need to call you back." The joys of subscription services with poor support.
1295361531887202304 2020-08-17 10:07:10 EDT <CasDistilled> Yep.  Did that.  You claim "no outages in the area" but even after restarting my modem it still fails to acquire a connection.  Quite a few people in my neighborhood are having issues as well according to Facebook.  #fail
1295359199090823169 2020-08-17 09:57:54 EDT <CasDistilled> @Xfinity All my devices are reporting that our Internet has been out for the last 5.4 hours.  That's more impressive than the 3-5 daily 10 minute outages.  Thanks!
1295337447795163137 2020-08-17 08:31:28 EDT <KayStinson> Xfinity outage. AT&T, it‚Äôs your time to shine, sweetie.
1295333182510903296 2020-08-17 08:14:31 EDT <B_Ray24> Well class started back for kids today in bluefield Va and guess what @comcast @Xfinity decided to do, have a outage everywhere that was supposed to b fixed at 7:15am that now switched to 10:45am
1295306977925529601 2020-08-17 06:30:23 EDT <greenrangertp> Another Monday morning, another @Xfinity #outage @FOXNashville @comcast pic.twitter.com/Xwut6DwhRF
1295253130859479041 2020-08-17 02:56:25 EDT <Rocastorm85> And on top of not being able to sleep Xfinity has an outage in my area so my internet just went down  pic.twitter.com/avqoGaikhy
1295225646935764992 2020-08-17 01:07:13 EDT <wynnecblue> It's gonna suck if there's still an outage Monday morning. I still have to work! @Xfinity #nointernet #washingtonstate
1295213228209967105 2020-08-17 00:17:52 EDT <seandoesfilm> i‚Äôm just tryna watch porn and xfinity has an outage this some bullshit
1295197204450365441 2020-08-16 23:14:11 EDT <isolatedsoulja> üòßYES I LIVE IN THE BAY ARE AND THEY SAID IT WAS AN OUTAGE AND IT SHOULD BE BACK ON BY 11:50
1295191611425488897 2020-08-16 22:51:58 EDT <MrEastlandPlays> So my outage restoration time has been pushed from 7:11 am, to 11:14 am, to 6:53 pm and now its 2:44 am.  Wth is the point of an ‚Äúestimate‚Äù when it keeps getting delayed??? Not to mention I have a class to teach at 8 am!
1295189063314669571 2020-08-16 22:41:50 EDT <idalsosmaknae> @Xfinity maybe if yall stanned loona there wouldnt be an outage rn  pic.twitter.com/aXIch1fVhD
1295183714545274883 2020-08-16 22:20:35 EDT <MissDeanna201> @Xfinity needs to be discounting our bill since there‚Äôs either an ‚Äúoutage‚Äù or a 8- hour ‚Äúscheduled maintenance‚Äù literally every other night........ üôÑ   Get any other internet service provider but Comcast/ Xfinity. Spend your money with a provider that actually provides.
1295174284021817344 2020-08-16 21:43:07 EDT <Gabeineducation> Yes!  It stopped my random outages with @Xfinity
1295166870476087296 2020-08-16 21:13:39 EDT <katbohac> Hey @comcastcares and @Xfinity any reason my service has now gone out twice in less than 3 days? And why no one replied to my earlier request for information?  Why are the outages occuring?????? #nointernet #nohelp
1295155452918009856 2020-08-16 20:28:17 EDT <Xfinity> Are you in an area outage?
1295154493835935744 2020-08-16 20:24:28 EDT <Xfinity> Hi. Does your My Account app indicate that you're in an area outage?
1295153098240012289 2020-08-16 20:18:56 EDT <Xfinity> Hi. Sorry for the frustration. Have you been in an area outage this whole time?
1295152037034958848 2020-08-16 20:14:43 EDT <wolvespassion> No outage...  The box making a small buzzing noise
1295149369570856965 2020-08-16 20:04:07 EDT <Xfinity> If you're in an outage, keep an eye on your My Account app for updates. They'll be provided as they are available.
1295147713533751301 2020-08-16 19:57:32 EDT <Xfinity> Did you check your My Account app to see if there's an outage in the area?
1295147632864657410 2020-08-16 19:57:13 EDT <Xfinity> And there's not an outage reported in your area?
1295146009530642432 2020-08-16 19:50:45 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Joshua. Have you checked your My Account app to see if there's an outage affecting your area?
1295145102067691520 2020-08-16 19:47:09 EDT <HashTagTreasure> Anybody else have Xfinity and also experiencing an outage???
1295143901553188865 2020-08-16 19:42:23 EDT <RileyHickman7> I was just told ours was do to power outages, my power has not been out!!
1295139517771341824 2020-08-16 19:24:58 EDT <mukulAmbulgekar> @Xfinity Internet is down in Santa Clara, CA from last 4 hours. I see outage in my area but earlier ETA was 4:00pm now it's 7:30pm, what's going on?
1295133004516298752 2020-08-16 18:59:05 EDT <ZombaitX> It‚Äôs just a normal @Xfinity cable internet connection that is plenty fast when it works properly but often has outages for a few seconds or a few minutes‚Äîenough to interrupt games and streaming services that require constant connections, even when connected directly to my‚Ä¶ 1/2
1295132354130960385 2020-08-16 18:56:30 EDT <Xfinity> Hi. Does your My Account app indicate there's an outage in the area?
1295108346865836032 2020-08-16 17:21:06 EDT <bexone> Hey @Xfinity this is the second 4+hour all-service outage in 48 hours but I don‚Äôt suppose I‚Äôll get a credit on my bill for the time you didn‚Äôt give me
1295104332145332224 2020-08-16 17:05:09 EDT <Xfinity> Does your My Account app indicate that you're in an outage when you notice an issue?
1295094342613434369 2020-08-16 16:25:27 EDT <RileyHickman7> New outage, this is laughable!
1295091577560408064 2020-08-16 16:14:28 EDT <jaxjan66> @Xfinity three days now we have intermittent outages after "working in the area to improve service."   What a crock of shit.  We pay too much for this to be intermittent.  If I worked from home during this pandemic, this would be an even bigger problem.
1295083610576433159 2020-08-16 15:42:48 EDT <CarsonSieving> Twitter, please help me. Comcast Xfinity in CT. Cant find a way to report an outage.
1295079479325241344 2020-08-16 15:26:23 EDT <mugandplay> An internet outage literally S I X T Y seconds after I hit the start streaming button. Xfinity, I'm not mad, I'm just, well, furious.
1295074205902544898 2020-08-16 15:05:26 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Riley. Has your My Account app indicated that you've been in an area outage?
1295071818026541056 2020-08-16 14:55:57 EDT <Joseadolfovela3> Internet outage in my area, I ordered a Comcast Xfinity modem as was suggested to remedy the problem since my router was being blamed for, well today 8/16  and internet signal is down. Wow. When can we have decent stable service. Almost every day, many times a day this happens.
1295069700150497283 2020-08-16 14:47:32 EDT <Camilla_33> Of course @Xfinity has an outage during the #Cubs game...
1295059223160659968 2020-08-16 14:05:54 EDT <bPardini10> If this was happening during the week, while I‚Äôm working. I‚Äôd cancel the service immediately. Already had to deal with internet outages 2 weeks ago. Fucked up my work big time. Not like I‚Äôm close to my office, that‚Äôs a 2hr drive.
1295055903092285441 2020-08-16 13:52:42 EDT <stinaxo> @Xfinity @comcastcares is there an outage in north NJ today? Doesn‚Äôt say so on map but I‚Äôve been down for over 6 hours now. Acct is up to date so it‚Äôs not a billing issue. HELP PLEASE!  pic.twitter.com/cIg5QmhFcq
1295044795514068992 2020-08-16 13:08:34 EDT <george_mage> @xfinity how is 24 hrs plus #xfinityoutage acceptable after a 90 minute rolling power outage?? Credit and explanation please
1295041259002834951 2020-08-16 12:54:31 EDT <darkcast> Hey @Xfinity who's dick do you I have to suck to get you guys guys to give me service?  Cause @SummitBroadband is complete trash.  Seriously though, if there's someone I can blow to make this a thing I'll do it.  5 days of outages is absolutely ridiculous
1295037776598114311 2020-08-16 12:40:41 EDT <ITryin22> My relative has not had TV Internet or phone since Aug 5 storm.  There was a message button on their online site so I tried that.  I have xfinity so I‚Äôm up.  I got there‚Äôs an outage but not ETA. Calling means going on hold for over an hour to be disconnected.
1295011436389900290 2020-08-16 10:56:01 EDT <lewmoe> @comcastcares  yours systems and software r useless. Apps show all service out but  its only internet. Outage map only shows limited area.  No status updates at all no estimated time of resolution. I got ATT fiber optics and it works great for internet. Xfinity failed us
1295008061313167361 2020-08-16 10:42:36 EDT <crowntowncol1> Is their a @Xfinity @comcast  Senior Management person @Xfinity  customers can contact when there are long unresolved outages?  #xfinityoutage
1295001062441734144 2020-08-16 10:14:47 EDT <crowntowncol1> Using the @Xfinity assistant has been very frustrating.  It seems like @comcast @Xfinity Senior Management does NOT want its customers to be able to live chat with its agents when there is a long @comcast outage in a area.  #xfinityoutage
1294885099998068736 2020-08-16 02:34:00 EDT <AshGoldsmithh> There have been so many @PGE4Me and @Xfinity outages in San Francisco in the past few years that we should probably be reimbursed for every hour we‚Äôre without service. Comcast is so expensive and the service is so bad it‚Äôs laughable.
1294875113809154053 2020-08-16 01:54:19 EDT <garciaa_marioo> hey @Xfinity your service is doo doo. there have been outages all day for what feels like a week now
1294846428049629185 2020-08-16 00:00:20 EDT <OrbitalNexuss> .@Xfinity 5 outages in 2 days. FIX YOUR SHIT!
1294844668891414529 2020-08-15 23:53:20 EDT <bPardini10> So now after the power outage Xfinity/Comcast refuses to reset and work. Saying in the message to my TV that I need to ‚Äòtighten‚Äô the cables. The cables that have not been touched since install 2+ years ago. They have restarted without problem after the previous outages WTF
1294836279151153155 2020-08-15 23:20:00 EDT <Hostile612> @CenturyLink I have been dealing with 3-4 outages a day where I have to reboot my modem every time for the last 2 months. I think I have had it. Time for @Xfinity next week.
1294829157659095040 2020-08-15 22:51:42 EDT <louismchugh> @comcast @Xfinity @comcastcares @comcast Being i cant get to an agent to fix my service as your automated system knows there is a storm related outage in my area. My service has been internment for 3 weeks now and im still having issues. I have to have stable internet to work.
1294823754359607298 2020-08-15 22:30:14 EDT <JasonBieker1> @comcastcares I live in the Atlanta area. Internet is out for myself and some neighbors. Is Xfinity aware of an outage in the area?
1294820473298137088 2020-08-15 22:17:12 EDT <Nikkirose2305> UGH! Outage AGAIN! Last weekend too! GET IT TOGETHER! #xfinity
1294820466914406401 2020-08-15 22:17:10 EDT <RyanLancaster94> @Xfinity you gonna fix the internet outage in Richmond or nah? It‚Äôs been down for like 12 hours
1294817267234926593 2020-08-15 22:04:27 EDT <paramchuk> Hey @Xfinity when I use the app and say I‚Äôd like to report an outage, telling me there isn‚Äôt one is directly contrary to the lights I see on my modem.  Why not let me report an outage instead of telling me I am wrong?
1294799324082298880 2020-08-15 20:53:09 EDT <jrube123> Why am I not surprised the I coy no response from @xfinity and @comcast re the outage that has been going on since Monday 8/10 people work from home more than ever now how is this acceptable #customerservicefail
1294794793684533248 2020-08-15 20:35:09 EDT <MrJakeGregory11> @Xfinity @comcastcares @ComcastIN have had technicians out 2 out of the last 3 days, have an escalated case and am still have internet outages, my whole network just disappears, getting a bit frustrated here
1294783884744429571 2020-08-15 19:51:48 EDT <AmeliaDesign1> Wait. You're in Miami?!?. I'm in Atlanta with outages.  So @xfinity outage is nationwide? ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1294770494911025152 2020-08-15 18:58:36 EDT <tamagoyuckie> Welp no internet. Xfinity outage :/ Using mobile data. At least I got to watch two episodes of fairytail! So jokes on you üòù
1294761176274886656 2020-08-15 18:21:34 EDT <AuntyAlias> Just experienced an Xfinity outage in my area. Lasted for about an hour. 3-4 hours less than the automated phone robot said it would. Power outage yesterday, internet today. I can do with less excitement in my life, I tells ya true.  pic.twitter.com/XmjAt2RmGt
1294758822205169673 2020-08-15 18:12:13 EDT <1ToSpaceTime> Xfinity cable outage in my area it sucks to be me right now #UFC252 ü§¨
1294756981207638016 2020-08-15 18:04:54 EDT <adrienFrenchy> And 2 outages in 2 days. Thanks @comcast @Xfinity @comcastcares and down until Monday seriously??? pic.twitter.com/WQ0cmE0vMt
1294746772787671042 2020-08-15 17:24:20 EDT <GamesJaza> Been having an outage at least once a day for the past month.
1294734352488837126 2020-08-15 16:34:59 EDT <BxEileen> @comcast @comcastcares #Xfinity. Is there a service outage in Pawling, NY? No internet service- can you please help- ty
1294725647806365699 2020-08-15 16:00:23 EDT <paininthebaas> @ndavid126 @Xfinity @comcastcares Enjoying the Cubs game this afternoon! Love how their commercials always preach that they don‚Äôt have outages. Typical of their poor service.  pic.twitter.com/CgWid32RZ1
1294711949821800448 2020-08-15 15:05:58 EDT <HikeoftheMenrys> Good morning @Xfinity! Is this going to be one of those days where I spend an hour with customer support rebooting my modem, only for you to report an area outage eight hours later? #comcastoutage
1294708921265946625 2020-08-15 14:53:56 EDT <AmeliaDesign1> Yes. Another outage today. That's three days of no service.
1294696191205179393 2020-08-15 14:03:20 EDT <crowntowncol1> When there is a large @comcast outage for a long time in the same area why can't @comcast @Xfinity tweet a message stating why their Internet is down and how long it will be down?  @Xfinity @comcast has failed Public Relations Class 101.  @comcastcares #SaturdayThoughts
1294673606434226182 2020-08-15 12:33:36 EDT <Luke_Cardona> Right around an 11 hour @Xfinity outage. Not supposed to be fixed up 2:30 pm (time pushed back). Longest Internet outage I‚Äôve ever experienced. Wonder what the issue is.
1294670439403290627 2020-08-15 12:21:01 EDT <PandaSalesman> Hi @Xfinity -- the good people at @SEACityLight secured the downed line and cleaned up your mess. We (and our neighbors) are still waiting on a crew to make repairs, and keep being told that "an outage has not been detected". So basically the control room scene from Chernobyl.  pic.twitter.com/zccnW7M9Nm
1294669901345382401 2020-08-15 12:18:52 EDT <NeenjaD> @comcast @Xfinity my cable service has been out for 12+ hours now. No internet, no television.   Your app keeps updating about the outage saying you're working in it, it will be fixed by xx time. Still not working & the time it will be fixed keeps getting extended. Tell the truth
1294658142194761730 2020-08-15 11:32:09 EDT <war77el> What @comcast/@comcastcares SHOULD be doing is distributing vouchers for covering overage charges incurred by those of us having no choice but to use tethered mobile data, due to the unexplained ("outage") absence of service from @Xfinity iSP.
1294653912700657666 2020-08-15 11:15:20 EDT <ablissfullemon> Yeah ours is still out too. I was told it was due to equipment failure from the storms earlier this week. Our outage map doesn‚Äôt even have an estimated date or time anymore. It‚Äôs just whenever they get to it, I guess.  pic.twitter.com/UpJGFMQIrF
1294653008144367617 2020-08-15 11:11:45 EDT <crowntowncol1> Will @Xfinity customers who have had a long Internet outage this month be getting a $4 credit off of their next months $250 @Xfinity  bill?  #SaturdayMotivation #Caturday #XfinityDown @comcast @GovHolcomb
1294652657366433798 2020-08-15 11:10:21 EDT <Alexei_Segall> More outages. No warnings. Today we have another internet outage. Your previous response you gave me a link to contact as if I didn‚Äôt already that. By my count I‚Äôm at 8 outages in August. That‚Äôs unacceptable.
1294651515945328648 2020-08-15 11:05:49 EDT <DarGoat_> They service has an outage damner everyday its so fucking annoying üòÇ I just hop off the game the whole night
1294650128217899011 2020-08-15 11:00:18 EDT <crowntowncol1> @Xfinity @comcast messaging has been very poor from a public relations standpoint regarding the @Xfinity  Internet Outage in Cedar Lake, Indiana this week.  Our internet has been down since Tuesday and @Xfinity will NOT tell us why it has been down for so long.  @comcastcares
1294648984397426689 2020-08-15 10:55:45 EDT <katbohac> Wondering if maybe @Twitter could force @comcastcares to change their name because care doesn‚Äôt seem to be representative of the truth.... outage since ~8pm PST last night & just got a notice maybe it will be back by 3:50pm @Xfinity #comcastoutage #nointernet #comcastdoesnotcare
1294647018997112838 2020-08-15 10:47:57 EDT <crowntowncol1> We have an @xfinity Internet outage listed for at least 500 customers in Cedar Lake, Indiana.  Our internet has been down since Tuesday.  Why wont @comcast @Xfinity tell us why our internet has been down for so long.  #XfinityInternetDown
1294632523616534528 2020-08-15 09:50:21 EDT <katbohac> @comcastcares any chance you have had an opportunity to look into what is causing your outage? It is still going on....... @Xfinity .... no service....?
1294623052811112448 2020-08-15 09:12:43 EDT <Spat50709326> @AskFrontier Good Morning. I am wondering why since yesterday we have an outage and no internet. I was hoping to wake up today and find internet restored. I have yet to come across a provider with this service that has no backup redundancy. Back to Xfinity for me
1294622678855417857 2020-08-15 09:11:14 EDT <ZemanMark> Its been almost a week and @comcast @Xfinity still hasn‚Äôt given us a consistent outage update for when service will be restored in @ParkForestIL. Many work from home while others need a @FortniteGame fix. We need something more than ‚Äúwe‚Äôre working on it‚Äù or varied restore timesüò°
1294610639399211009 2020-08-15 08:23:23 EDT <katbohac> @comcastcares hi- what is the cause of the outage that has been going on for over 8 hours now? Is there an eta on repair? #nointernet #California #yetagain @Xfinity
1294598930412470273 2020-08-15 07:36:52 EDT <MeekoSuavee> Dear @Xfinity I‚Äôm honestly so damn tired of paying my WiFi bill (ON TIME) for there to be so many outages! 3 times this week there‚Äôs been an outage over a hour long!
1294595553318375424 2020-08-15 07:23:26 EDT <Evilution84> Lol @Xfinity @comcastcares agents attempted to lie that this is a ‚Äúplanned‚Äù outage. That didn‚Äôt end well for the agent. Still no internet.
1294555446762770432 2020-08-15 04:44:04 EDT <Michelle112Ryan> There is a local WiFi outage in my area thanks Xfinity I jus wanna put some tv on & go to sleep
1294538011875643392 2020-08-15 03:34:48 EDT <Maurice60653> Xfinity outage
1294515611863670786 2020-08-15 02:05:47 EDT <UShouldHaveKno1> @Xfinity and @comcastcares these unplanned 8 to 10hr outages this week have been unacceptable. What is more unacceptable is how you try to set up your IVR so people can‚Äôt get to a live rep. I see this is a nationwide issue and not just Miami. Poor service!
1294515131477569541 2020-08-15 02:03:52 EDT <UShouldHaveKno1> @Xfinity and @comcastcares these unplanned 8 to 10hr outages this week have been unacceptable.

1294491347567640579 2020-08-15 00:29:22 EDT <Slappy202TV> Xfinity outage in my area, for 4+ hours. Awesome stuff
1294486242801758208 2020-08-15 00:09:05 EDT <dbonasera> In the 1.5 years that I have had @Xfinity internet and tv I have had more outages than I ever had in the 10 years that I was with AT&T/Directv. I truly regret the switch. I‚Äôm constantly missing games! Oh and their headquarters is literally right next door to my complex üò°
1294459422618595328 2020-08-14 22:22:30 EDT <GrammyRock6> @Xfinity your service SUCKS right now.  Going on a 12+++ hour outage. And your service tells us it'll be back ASAP. #Wrong #AdjustMyBill
1294455209964367872 2020-08-14 22:05:46 EDT <asiabeaird> Is anyone else having a WiFi outage in Sacramento that has @Xfinity
1294450498360078338 2020-08-14 21:47:03 EDT <Leisl_Bonell> Your near constant outages in our area are costing us hours of work & income. Needless to say, we are very unhappy with your service.
1294449116747927558 2020-08-14 21:41:33 EDT <RPorkins> Hey @Xfinity,  We REALLY appreciate almost daily internet outages and exceptionally bad customer service. Either fix your shit, or get the fuck out of Tucson.  Bonus fuck you to the @fcc for allowing cable monopolies in the first place.
1294441751529140224 2020-08-14 21:12:17 EDT <brodbee> @comcast @Xfinity its 2020.  Time for accurate messages when there are outages.  #growup  https://twitter.com/brodbee/status/1294440117738692608¬†‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/cuANiztwHK
1294441644859809792 2020-08-14 21:11:52 EDT <alixt_3> Fix this damn outage bruh @Xfinity
1294436836366880768 2020-08-14 20:52:45 EDT <PandaSalesman> Again: This is not just an outage, it is roughly 100 feet of downed line in the street. It is a hazard.
1294428753788116992 2020-08-14 20:20:38 EDT <boosteDan> @Xfinity when will your service be back up in Elmhurst, IL? You haven‚Äôt provided any outage updates on your site other than stating all services are down for 2,500+ customers at 2pm.
1294426560473243651 2020-08-14 20:11:55 EDT <CrayCray19> @Xfinity I can‚Äôt access my account to check if there‚Äôs an outage since my internet hasn‚Äôt been working since this morning. Every time I try to log into my account it directs me to an old account I had during college. HELP ME!
1294416633885270026 2020-08-14 19:32:29 EDT <ZemanMark> Hey @Xfinity could you please give us a definitive timeframe when our service will be restored?  I know storms are a pain in the rear, but your outage updates are killing me. One day it‚Äôs 4pm by tomorrow, the next is 11:35 tonight to ‚Äúwe‚Äôre working on it‚Äù. So which is it?
1294413288978161665 2020-08-14 19:19:11 EDT <HodorDaGawd> Just frequent outages, and then when I try and call you guys I can never get a person on the line, your automated service runs me in circles then disconnects.
1294408313325707265 2020-08-14 18:59:25 EDT <ianowatson> @Xfinity my entire business is now on hold bc of yet another outage.
1294407873745821699 2020-08-14 18:57:40 EDT <ianowatson> @Xfinity another outage this is ridiculous!! Paying a lot of money for the ‚Äúso-called‚Äù best service and I have yet another outage.  @ATT starting to look good!!
1294402215721889797 2020-08-14 18:35:11 EDT <optimolus> @gowave_g I‚Äôve been experiencing constant outages ever since I switched to you guys- my internet goes out for ~10-15mins almost every other day!  I regret leaving Xfinity so bad right now despite their terrible upload speeds- not a single outage in the four months or so I had em.
1294397418902106112 2020-08-14 18:16:08 EDT <Xfinity> That's frustrating, Bob! Does the Xfinity My Account app still list an area outage?
1294394868106657792 2020-08-14 18:05:59 EDT <havana_nightz> Comcast count your days or Xfinity you are about to get canceled. Outage has lasted 5 days. @comcast @Xfinity
1294390525190197248 2020-08-14 17:48:44 EDT <fionnualatiel> üòÅ üòÖ that‚Äôs great fingers crossedü§û you are now outage free for a good long while
1294386873234862082 2020-08-14 17:34:13 EDT <dandaly71> @Xfinity    This is what your crappy service is causing my neighborhood to do.   Outages every day for over a month.   Cannot wait until @ATT  fiber hits our block !!! pic.twitter.com/vXp4wkpEnt
1294384199424778241 2020-08-14 17:23:36 EDT <Xfinity> Are you seeing any outage information in your My Account app?
1294377844370546689 2020-08-14 16:58:21 EDT <kalleyyoung> If there‚Äôs an internet outage, there‚Äôs an outage, I get that. But do NOT keep this notification posted & continuously change the time. I‚Äôve seen the time change each hour since 10AM. Get your shit straight @Xfinity  pic.twitter.com/XhOKUnExZq
1294373964844797954 2020-08-14 16:42:56 EDT <saraljackson> @Xfinity You couldn't pay someone to give you worse service than this company. 10 - 5pm still cannot get a competent person on the line...wow!! Service still out...no outage in the area just xfinity providing it's usual shitty service.
1294373864475156481 2020-08-14 16:42:32 EDT <Xfinity> Oh no, Joe! Do you know if there is an area outage affecting your location? The My Account app will provide this info.
1294370868504727552 2020-08-14 16:30:37 EDT <JAY_SON_23> I hate @Xfinity y‚Äôall have the longest outages, going on 13 hours here.
1294369746473766912 2020-08-14 16:26:10 EDT <SugrShuriken> My WiFi has been cutting out almost every 15 minutes. @Xfinity shows no outages so what to do.......
1294367575456075783 2020-08-14 16:17:32 EDT <azcat59> @Xfinity your customer service stinks.  Almost non-stop outage, can't talk to a human....you're lucky you're a monopoly #xfinitystinks
1294366537516609536 2020-08-14 16:13:25 EDT <SasquatchFuzz> After multiple resets things appear to be back online.  Site didn‚Äôt show an outage, but there was a local power outage nearby.
1294362083434409988 2020-08-14 15:55:43 EDT <selfishnessless> @Xfinity Thanks for the outage on a Friday afternoon. Est. 4 hours for a fix? Business class internet my ass. Now I have to work on Saturday because of you inept turds.
1294360455729696768 2020-08-14 15:49:15 EDT <rarosales15> 1/In the time of Covid and working from home/remote learning it would be nice to have reliable internet service....I‚Äôm so done with @Xfinity service. Not only do we have an outage EVERY Friday but we lose service daily.  And their solution sending another tech at my expense  pic.twitter.com/G29PkefBrd
1294347458294820872 2020-08-14 14:57:36 EDT <Xfinity> Hi, Cate. We apologize for the constant issues you've been running into. Are you finding yourself in an area outage currently?
1294347336055914497 2020-08-14 14:57:07 EDT <JA_Hood20> What else is new when it comes to @comcast @Xfinity !! Always an outage ‚Äî  pic.twitter.com/0GUZVXHWLi
1294345549957734400 2020-08-14 14:50:01 EDT <cbonac> I was already less than thrilled at the absurdly slow connection that drops calls, but now I‚Äôve had multiple internet outages over the last month. Right as my rates just went up. What gives, @Xfinity?
1294344307323940864 2020-08-14 14:45:05 EDT <lawyerinbeta> Hi @xfinity! My service has been hot garbage this week, especially bad on Weds and Thurs, and now a disaster today. Please fix this. It is a sunny Florida afternoon rn, so even though a light rain often inexplicably results in a service outage, no such conditions are present
1294342402631663617 2020-08-14 14:37:31 EDT <Klumzy> @Xfinity why does my area have outages almost every day around the same time??  I have been calling to try to get an answer as to why this keeps happening.  I was told Monday that someone would call to schedule a tech to look at our equipment and it is Friday and I never got call
1294333359645130752 2020-08-14 14:01:35 EDT <Xfinity> Hi. Does the My Account app list an area outage?
1294315491037782018 2020-08-14 12:50:34 EDT <NicolleBradford> @Xfinity internet appears to be down in #OldTown #AlexandriaVA. Anyone else experiencing an outage? Currently working on a presentation on my mobile hotspot. @comcastcares #ALX
1294311564712071173 2020-08-14 12:34:58 EDT <misstashamillz> So there‚Äôs Xfinity outage in the area. Smh
1294283271061340161 2020-08-14 10:42:33 EDT <liyah_kb> Xfinity gotta be the worst Internet service provider ever bruh. Outages every week man.
1294272781568413696 2020-08-14 10:00:52 EDT <Feels13200486> @Xfinity #OUT I have an outage in the ReedWood area in Joliet at the moment, just wondering if you guys are aware of this... I know you guys are busy with the Derecho. Just wondering.
1294272613162917890 2020-08-14 10:00:12 EDT <Te_rrell> Xfinity way too expensive to be having outages.. tf
1294271736347795457 2020-08-14 09:56:43 EDT <jamielevdan> Me: Ok, I am going to sign into writing group, finish a syllabus, work on my Canvas sites, and zoom with my mentir before I take on childcare duties at 2.   @Xfinity:   [alt text: status update indicating outage until 1:20pm]  pic.twitter.com/VGzijzPMZH
1294260447600947200 2020-08-14 09:11:51 EDT <oheycorona> No, I checked the outage map and there was none reported. It also says they didn‚Äôt find any service issues. Still slow.
1294249552137129988 2020-08-14 08:28:33 EDT <gauravkanoongo> @comcastcares - so even after multiple reminders, you don't wanna respond to this complaint.   This is just to let you know that this is my final request to get this issue addressed before reaching-out to higher authorities. #xfinity #outage
1294206708416380928 2020-08-14 05:38:19 EDT <AmDeadly> I know we aren't doing tik toks when you have an outage...
1294202158020202497 2020-08-14 05:20:14 EDT <Mynameismud24> And this is why I have had 4 outages in the past 3 weeks because they are working 24/7 to resolve my needs???  Let‚Äôs get a first time fix as opposed to trying to fix. Do you job!
1294201760098197513 2020-08-14 05:18:39 EDT <Mynameismud24> @comcastcares Not sure what‚Äôs going on with xfinity but I have had 4 outages in the past 3 weeks.  Please fix this, let‚Äôs get a first time fix and lay it to bed. Horrible !
1294144347894476800 2020-08-14 01:30:31 EDT <cynthiadomingz> I'll definitely factor this in to the next place I move. There's been a major outage over that past 72 hours affecting both cell towers and fiber in the East Bay/Dublin after @Xfinity made service "improvements".
1294142146191093760 2020-08-14 01:21:46 EDT <daltone77> Oh wow yet ANOTHER internet outage from @comcast @Xfinity... Maybe I should‚Äôve switched to @ATT after all. ü§¨üò°
1294130888641589249 2020-08-14 00:37:02 EDT <Acille_A_Marrar> When @Xfinity sends you a paper mail that they're raising the cost of our subscription but the thing is that I'm sending this from my at & t connection cause the @Xfinity wifi is out üòÖü§£ #Internet_Outage
1294128813283012608 2020-08-14 00:28:47 EDT <chemparrot> For sure you‚Äôre in a different situation. In this case I was still out though the ‚Äúoutage‚Äù had been fixed the day before...they forgot to reboot a switch or something.
1294108817958096897 2020-08-13 23:09:20 EDT <iSoPluggedIn> First it was @Xfinity , now @Xbox wants to have a outage? Smh
1294096050685464576 2020-08-13 22:18:36 EDT <Thattoksgirl> So @Xfinity we are just going to have power outage for 2 hours an counting?!! Bronzeville Chicago Land area!
1294091411122524160 2020-08-13 22:00:10 EDT <KoMostE23> @Xfinity My house has lost wifi connection completely for some reason. I have Check the outage map and it says that there are no service outages at my address. Please can you guys help?
1294089100274917376 2020-08-13 21:50:59 EDT <moore2score> According to the Outage Map, no.  I tried to restart my modem but it failed. I also tried unplugging my router & starting it back up, but that didn‚Äôt work either.
1294088373993275392 2020-08-13 21:48:06 EDT <HotBlondMess> @Xfinity @comcast how long are these south King County outages going to keep happening? I have 2 kids who start school in two weeks, and need to know if I have to make the switch so they can work...
1294085329864065024 2020-08-13 21:36:00 EDT <ItsTylerJohnn> @Xfinity Okay so many people especially in my town of Pelham are complaining about your internet including myself. It continuously goes out multiple times in an hour let alone a day.. what the hell is the issue? It can‚Äôt be hardware if everyone in town is having the same outages.
1294084598545096709 2020-08-13 21:33:05 EDT <TheMindWire> @Xfinity outage again at 95070. 3rd outage in as many weeks. What's the problem?
1294084207774437377 2020-08-13 21:31:32 EDT <THY7TH> Update 8, Confused.  Internet is still out.. kinda? There's no wifi. However, my PC is connected with an Ethernet cable so I can still access the internet... even though Xfinity showed us they're still having an outage in some places.  pic.twitter.com/3NQgRgCHeO
1294079872218861568 2020-08-13 21:14:19 EDT <DarrenFarley9> Daily internet and TV outages.  Only thing working is the automatic payment that comes out.  Agents and techs wont help, just blame everything on covid.
1294076958389809153 2020-08-13 21:02:44 EDT <SheSoDesired> @Xfinity yoooo this outage is not wassup! It‚Äôs happened 3 times today! Wtf is going on!?
1294063509332877313 2020-08-13 20:09:17 EDT <adanx> @Xfinity Is there an outage at the moment???
1294047828059152384 2020-08-13 19:06:59 EDT <MarktheBat> It‚Äôs cool to know we‚Äôre not the only ones having the Xfinity Outage, but can we talk about THIS condescending retort...tighten the cables?? Really?!   Fuck right off @Xfinity  pic.twitter.com/E7hYIu6u8x
1294046810072387586 2020-08-13 19:02:56 EDT <RotMGFlosion> Man, after such a good day, with no internet outages, @Xfinity  is back on their bullshit lmao. Constant disconnects and near 0 speed üôÉ
1294034598645637121 2020-08-13 18:14:24 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked your My Account app to see if there's an outage in the area?
1294032452420132865 2020-08-13 18:05:53 EDT <VashTheLazer> Got an Xfinity outage in my area so ima go play Ghost I guess..
1294028391331631105 2020-08-13 17:49:45 EDT <KaelinPhysics> Just came back on, but still annoyed that the app never showed an outage at my address. And which there was a way of simply reporting an outage.
1294027592912142337 2020-08-13 17:46:34 EDT <9inning_Josh> Already chatted with someone who confirmed outage in the area. I didn't have a fraction of the issues I've had with centurylink when i had @Xfinity just couldn't stand the inflated prices.
1294027340570402818 2020-08-13 17:45:34 EDT <Dhobbzberry> Lol xfinity outage and my ac ain‚Äôt cranking like usual WHAT THE FUCK
1294013422464622595 2020-08-13 16:50:16 EDT <crowntowncol1> Will people who have had long @Xfinity @comcast outages be getting a credit on their next bill?  We pay around $250 for @Xfinity.  That's like paying a car payment.
1294012865045835777 2020-08-13 16:48:03 EDT <crowntowncol1> Our Internet in Cedar Lake, Indiana has been out since Tuesday.  Do Cedar Lake, Indiana customers who have had a long internet outage still have to pay the full High @Xfinity @comcast price for their next bill?
1294010950345990149 2020-08-13 16:40:26 EDT <Xfinity> Does the My Account app list any area outages?
1294007838369603585 2020-08-13 16:28:04 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Jeffrey. Have you checked your My Account app to see if there's an outage in your area?
1294007410659663878 2020-08-13 16:26:22 EDT <Xfinity> Sorry for the frustration, are you in an area outage currently?
1293999695195508740 2020-08-13 15:55:43 EDT <King__Jasmine> Xfinity talking about a outage til tomorrow. üôÑ
1293999288368988166 2020-08-13 15:54:06 EDT <hennyrollins> @Xfinity I‚Äôve already been with customer service today but these consistent 60647 outages are affecting my ability to WORK. what‚Äôs going on?
1293998076697489413 2020-08-13 15:49:17 EDT <JRosengard> Seriously, @Xfinity you‚Äôre killing me. We‚Äôre getting close to 5 hours of outage w/no forecast when it will be fixed or even why.  pic.twitter.com/qIDYaYSIIp
1293998025321467906 2020-08-13 15:49:05 EDT <spatters9386> @Xfinity Yes. This happens multiple times a week. Today at 1:40, 2:00, 2:12 and 2:21. Tech was out 2 weeks ago and outages still happen. Down at 3:17 and again at 3:46. What is going on? I‚Äôve been kicked out of three conference calls.
1293994862551990282 2020-08-13 15:36:31 EDT <luisizchcknoris> There was an outage but it was fixed supposedly, I don‚Äôt understand what the issue could be now
1293989410199879680 2020-08-13 15:14:51 EDT <MattRyderTV> LOL. Cute. Yet you can‚Äôt figure out why you have daily outages or make it impossible to reach a human to talk to.  Daily reported outages with no fix and no help from ANYONE at your company. #FCC #comcastdoesNOTcare #xfinityoutage
1293989145522647041 2020-08-13 15:13:48 EDT <sophiadarkangel> Internet is off. Xfinity is having outages and makes me want another provider because this is annoying
1293985373337550850 2020-08-13 14:58:48 EDT <skylerkoshy> I wish I never switched to xfinity. All the time I have service OUTAGE in my area. @comcastcares @comcastbusiness @Xfinity #latestnews #Covid_19 #WorkIt #StayHome #techno #TechnologyGyan #detroittoday #Michiganders pic.twitter.com/D51G1ZbjZU
1293983017342558209 2020-08-13 14:49:27 EDT <Xfinity> We can help. Are you seeing any area outage info in your My Account app?
1293982780339216385 2020-08-13 14:48:30 EDT <realBobLawler> Yeah, I did that. That's how I knew the outages were unplanned abd affected 2.5k customers.  You suggest that as if it's some kind of remedy or answer. It's not.
1293981767930699778 2020-08-13 14:44:29 EDT <CryptidKazper> Hey @Xfinity @comcastcares, my internet has been out for three days and whenever we try to log in to our account it just gives us error messages. Just trying to figure out if there is an outage in my area.
1293979409104461825 2020-08-13 14:35:06 EDT <spatters9386> Yes. This happens multiple times a week. Today at 1:40, 2:00, 2:12 and 2:21. Tech was out 2 weeks ago and outages still happen.
1293976878123016192 2020-08-13 14:25:03 EDT <JRosengard> @Xfinity Internet outage for over 3 hours & no indication of why it‚Äôs down or when it will be back up. Working from home is impossible b/c the hotspots aren‚Äôt connecting. Whats going on?
1293974675085840384 2020-08-13 14:16:18 EDT <Xfinity> Sorry for this happening! Are you in an ares outage or seeing any issues in your My Account app?
1293966385756938240 2020-08-13 13:43:21 EDT <Xfinity> Hi, Josh. You can see the most up to date status of this outage in your My Account app. If it's fixed sooner, it can be seen there as well. We apologize for this downtime.
1293963567465730051 2020-08-13 13:32:09 EDT <TraceyMac1128> @Xfinity outage AGAINüò° Hard to work from home with this crap happening constantly. My contract is up in Sept., and switching to AT&T looks more and more inticing.
1293962995861794816 2020-08-13 13:29:53 EDT <joshblum> @Xfinity How do I get actual info on an outage. Your status says it's out for three days?
1293961454924767234 2020-08-13 13:23:46 EDT <ChaosInGa> I just reboot. Don‚Äôt know how to test. Did the chat yesterday and she did whatever she does and disappeared. My neighborhood experienced two outages and will undergo maintenance tonight at 3am. Still no real updates about potential cause or resolution.
1293954908320931840 2020-08-13 12:57:45 EDT <Mikeand1keFGC> Been talking to @Xfinity far too long today. One outage that blew through hours ago spawned me just not being able to connect to internet at all. They are NOT helping either.
1293952426911899654 2020-08-13 12:47:53 EDT <Xfinity> Ok, continue to check the app for the duration of the outage in case updates are provided.
1293949490131607562 2020-08-13 12:36:13 EDT <todd1427> @Xfinity outage just went from will be fixed at 1 to will be fixed at 5üôÉ
1293949287903178753 2020-08-13 12:35:25 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Andrea. Checking in with you to see what the Xfinity My Account app is saying about the outage in your area.
1293948936944852995 2020-08-13 12:34:01 EDT <gisellenthecity> Okay so @Xfinity has been doing the MOST lately with these Internet outages #DowntownAtlanta
1293948535541583875 2020-08-13 12:32:25 EDT <Xfinity> What's going on with your internet and are you aware of any outages in your area?
1293945565563281408 2020-08-13 12:20:37 EDT <MysterEWoodz> Its still saying its an outage in the area but it allowed me to connect on my phone.
1293938999535513602 2020-08-13 11:54:32 EDT <mchigh_marty> Second day in a row there‚Äôs an outage in my neighborhood. Wtf is going on @Xfinity
1293938679313047552 2020-08-13 11:53:16 EDT <myhoneypeaches> @Xfinity Hi guys, I know you‚Äôre getting a lot of questions about your Internet being out, I can‚Äôt access my account but I was wondering if there was an outage in Houston?
1293934455736930304 2020-08-13 11:36:29 EDT <_Chaselol_> internet went out as soon as I woke up :( make the outage go away @Xfinity
1293934139918430208 2020-08-13 11:35:13 EDT <burrmanchu> @Xfinity @comcastcares let's try this again.. my internet has been down for 3 days. It was fine way after the Derecho. How long is this gonna be in Peoria IL? Your 800 number literally hangs up on me if i call. I'm gonna switch to itv3 if you don't explain the outage by today.
1293929728009740288 2020-08-13 11:17:41 EDT <Xfinity> Continue to check the app throughout the outage to see if the estimate changes. Hopefully it is restored sooner.
1293929019822546946 2020-08-13 11:14:53 EDT <cannethomas> @comcast @Xfinity @comcastcares These extended outages in 30338 are constant and ridiculous. People cannot work without internet. Live broadcasts and video meetings are perilous if even possible. #comcastoutage #overit #waybeyondinconvenience
1293925219770544129 2020-08-13 10:59:47 EDT <holypujoles> I am paying entirely too much money to @Xfinity to have internet outages all the damn time while trying to work. @comcastcares where do I send my invoice for income lost due to internet outage?
1293914283344973825 2020-08-13 10:16:19 EDT <AmberHa02042095> @Xfinity when is this maintenance in Denver going to be finished? This is day 3 of hours long outages. There was no warning of when we could expect this and it is really frustrating.
1293913967639687171 2020-08-13 10:15:04 EDT <87soos> App shows no outage in our area, and there clearly is one.
1293913273524301825 2020-08-13 10:12:18 EDT <Xfinity> Continue to Check the Xfinity My Account app  or log in via our mobile browser on your cellular device at  http://xfin.tv/status¬† throughout the outage. Here you'll find the latest information including estimated time to repair.
1293912516251152388 2020-08-13 10:09:18 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Chris, according to the MY Account app are you part of an area-wide outage?
1293909949928497153 2020-08-13 09:59:06 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Topher, according to the My Account app is there an outage in your area?
1293908771517763584 2020-08-13 09:54:25 EDT <RealAwkwardPage> @Xfinity #outages caused me to lose business, and my wife (hospital leadership) to be unable to work.  After calling them, they gave us a discount for June but then overcharged us (for that same amount) for July!!
1293905744111243265 2020-08-13 09:42:23 EDT <sayrat187> @Xfinity can you put a rush on getting the outage fixed in 21211. I can‚Äôt wait until 12:30 to be back up and running. I have work to do!
1293902148670033920 2020-08-13 09:28:06 EDT <MsRogersNeborhd> @Xfinity wtf are y‚Äôall doing abt these damn outages!
1293895211043741696 2020-08-13 09:00:32 EDT <KrisKreepshow> I‚Äôve Been Paying For An @Xfinity WiFi Pass For The Past 6 Months To Use The Hotspot In My Area & This Morning It Doesnt Seem To Have Any Internet Connection! Could It Just Be A Temporary Outage Related To The Severe Storms Here In Chicagoland?! üßê @comcastcares
1293885890335514630 2020-08-13 08:23:30 EDT <Xfinity> Hi! Watch this short video:  https://xfin.tv/3aj614K¬† for simple ways to enhance your WiFi network and optimize connectivity or visit the Xfinity My Account app for the most updated outage information.
1293876799794032641 2020-08-13 07:47:22 EDT <barbara36989061> @Xfinity Looking for information on a credit for the power outage
1293841060980981760 2020-08-13 05:25:21 EDT <jstallworth75> Xfinity needs to hurry and fix the internet outage so I can suck ass at TF2ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1293819305465802752 2020-08-13 03:58:55 EDT <WuceRS> My internet has been cut out for the past 2 hours. There was an outage on Xfinity and it cut my stream abruptly short.  Sorry to everyone that was looking forward to it. I'll be back tomorrow!
1293807060786622464 2020-08-13 03:10:15 EDT <nicolas_samer> Dealing with Xfinity outage in my area and they keep pushing the date and time for restoration. I can‚Äôt believe in 2020 there are companies @Xfinity that sucks in communication for outages.
1293804471982493698 2020-08-13 02:59:58 EDT <NathalieABC30> Anyone else dealing with an @Xfinity internet outage? They‚Äôve been pushing the expected restoration time all day! #xfinityoutage
1293802524256935937 2020-08-13 02:52:14 EDT <ChristinaAMN> After 15 minutes of trying to find a number to call JUST TO SEE IF THERE IS AN OUTAGE there is planned(?) maintenance until 6am. So, I guess I'm done working tonight. Thanks for fucking me, @Xfinity. You're a GREAT company.
1293799645613891584 2020-08-13 02:40:47 EDT <ChristinaAMN> SO GLAD I need my roommates @Xfinity log in JUST to see if there's an outage since my service, which is usually shit, just dropped completely. That's WILDLY helpful. REALLY.
1293798230233198598 2020-08-13 02:35:10 EDT <alexxxxandrag> Wow this is the longest outage ever @Xfinity  pic.twitter.com/j9LS80aSxM
1293788801752395778 2020-08-13 01:57:42 EDT <Teedz__> Fix your dang outage @comcast @Xfinity! First it‚Äôs 3:30 PM, then 11:00 PM, now 2:00 AM?! THIS IS RIDICULOUS... #fail pic.twitter.com/SUbB5MSAwA
1293781521883705345 2020-08-13 01:28:46 EDT <ashnapri> @Xfinity why your app says there is no outage reported in my area and suddenly you are performing routine system maintenance, I am working and need to stop because your service sucks?????
1293779143763599360 2020-08-13 01:19:19 EDT <realBobLawler> Second unplanned outage affecting 2.5k customers in my area in < 16h?!   WTH, @Xfinity?!
1293775446744563712 2020-08-13 01:04:38 EDT <aridreaa> Hey @Xfinity my area has had an Internet Outage for the past 12hrs now. :(
1293771433764675584 2020-08-13 00:48:41 EDT <weaslewoozle> I feel like there's an xfinity outage every other week
1293770420005384192 2020-08-13 00:44:39 EDT <alexxxxandrag> I pay so much for @Xfinity internet just to get consistent outages. Internet has been down for 8 hours now
1293769089681424384 2020-08-13 00:39:22 EDT <alligator_ashes> @comcastcares Another outage! EVERYDAY for the last 24 days there have been internet outages in West Palm Beach! Why are you taking payment and not providing services? What makes #comcast any different than a common thief? #comcastoutage #xfinity  pic.twitter.com/tOnNUIyFTk
1293756175503241218 2020-08-12 23:48:03 EDT <newamerykahn> ughhhhh I stg I hate @Verizon.  not sure if they pushed a new update or some weird outage due to the storming but they done fucked up my @sonos connection & im hot.  When tf is @xfinity coming to this neighborhood lawd.
1293754028493606917 2020-08-12 23:39:31 EDT <ChxckenAlfredo> comcast you‚Äôre the biggest trash. how do i have internet for 8+ hours then y‚Äôall have an outage?! @Xfinity @comcast @comcastcares i want a prorated rate for the 2+ days of outage or ill go to @DishNation
1293751332025831428 2020-08-12 23:28:48 EDT <WithLove_Taki> Man!! I‚Äôm so upset like they stay having outages almost every night, I don‚Äôt get it. Everything needs WiFi now so I can do shit üò≠
1293749377832558595 2020-08-12 23:21:03 EDT <adamkstout> to my previous tweets, and I‚Äôm extremely frustrated. @Xfinity @comcastcares you need to do something about this ongoing problem. You are faaaaar to expensive for me to be dealing with these constant outages, which are making it very difficult to do my job. Fix this.
1293749375651454976 2020-08-12 23:21:02 EDT <adamkstout> Haven‚Äôt been home to need the internet for the last week, so not sure how many outages we‚Äôve had. But tonight, while trying to fix settings for my virtual #pianobar broadcast tmw night, net was out again. Same time as my reg bdcst. @comcast @Xfinity has failed to respond (1/2)  https://twitter.com/adamkstout/status/1289143976130416640¬†‚Ä¶
1293746263729549319 2020-08-12 23:08:40 EDT <norijpeg> Do you live close to us? Because same, we‚Äôve had outages every day
1293728986967822339 2020-08-12 22:00:01 EDT <brentbrookhouse> Xfinity outage says it‚Äôll last until after midnight on the 15th. But then we get TV and internet back for about four hours only for it to go back out just now. This has been a real fun week.
1293726313593806848 2020-08-12 21:49:24 EDT <Martin04199251> ü§î Very interesting #xfinity #fox #outage  https://twitter.com/KMPHFOX26/status/1293720043511922688¬†‚Ä¶
1293724061520936960 2020-08-12 21:40:27 EDT <LarissaChm> @CenturyLink once again, you fail.  You deny an outage for nearly a week and then lie several times and  say you fixed it.  Still no service.  Big fat fail.  I guess I need to contact @Xfinity after being a loyal customer for 15 years.
1293723225290166278 2020-08-12 21:37:07 EDT <brittStacks> xfinity and these outages üòê
1293718298803212288 2020-08-12 21:17:33 EDT <Xfinity> Are you seeing any outage completion time in your My Account app?
1293715953864323072 2020-08-12 21:08:14 EDT <bw3980> Had a power outage in my area.. went out at 9 a.m. and came back on at 4 p.m.
1293711254142558208 2020-08-12 20:49:33 EDT <kateslu> #xfinity I rec‚Äôd this message: Xfinity Alerts: Service is restored! Is your equipment working now?    I answered: No.   Xfinity response:        XfinityAlerts: How can I help: Appointments, txt APPT. Balance, txt BAL. Pay Bill, txt PAY. Technical/Outage, txt OUTAGE.? WHO IS CEO?
1293707153182728192 2020-08-12 20:33:15 EDT <SheaFlynn> @Xfinity you‚Äôre a horrible company. I have an outage every 3 weeks. That‚Äôs not acceptable.
1293706657864790017 2020-08-12 20:31:17 EDT <threeupthreedwn> Is it shady that the @Xfinity app won't allow me to take a screenshot of the outage map, to show my employer that my internet was indeed out? I thought so...
1293702238221799425 2020-08-12 20:13:44 EDT <Xfinity> Hi! What's been up with your internet? Are you in an area outage?
1293702074774020096 2020-08-12 20:13:05 EDT <Xfinity> What's going on with your internet? Are you in an outage?
1293699121279307777 2020-08-12 20:01:20 EDT <AgentJCK> @Xfinity internet etc has been out since 2:00pm today..this is ridiculous...what exactly is causing this outage?  Fayetteville, GA
1293691588724625409 2020-08-12 19:31:25 EDT <obsessedjay> xfinity keep testing my patience with these outages  pic.twitter.com/JWv2pLKGz0
1293691353063395328 2020-08-12 19:30:28 EDT <LaynieKlawer> @Xfinity and why must we beg you for our pathetic $3 daily credit when you damn well know you have an outage. Proactively credit customers when you have problems and maybe you would actually have happy customers üôÑüôÑ
1293688272166834176 2020-08-12 19:18:14 EDT <Rutherfordx9> 15 year customer...we depend on internet for work and school. Service  outage with our rented modem and the earliest service appointment is 6 days out! #highprice #poorservice #crap
1293685128674160640 2020-08-12 19:05:44 EDT <KassidyHARTman> I‚Äôm ashamed at how angry I am I don‚Äôt have internet,tv, etc. because of an @Xfinity service outage....but at the same time, I DONT HAVE INTERNET, TV, ETC.  pic.twitter.com/a6i41iuFeu
1293684973376090112 2020-08-12 19:05:07 EDT <7deadly_sinz> No there are no outages or issues in the area we've done all the troubleshooting and called and they've done all the troubleshooting so they have to send a technician out but we have to pay for it. Seems pretty unfair. so not only am I losing money I have to pay to repair service
1293684505941860356 2020-08-12 19:03:16 EDT <B_DOG94> Have complete outage no line no cable or wifi
1293683539267878912 2020-08-12 18:59:25 EDT <H4ckerW> @Xfinity Fukkk u!!!!! Why the hell the outage again !!!!
1293683038115725318 2020-08-12 18:57:26 EDT <iamthesungodess> No outage, just bad customer service and long waiting times.
1293682950001659904 2020-08-12 18:57:05 EDT <KaixxWRLD> No outage in our area, it just states to troubleshoot the problem. We unplugged the motem, and plugged it back in.
1293682656173895680 2020-08-12 18:55:55 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked your My Account app to see if there is an outage in your area?
1293681742935539715 2020-08-12 18:52:17 EDT <Teedz__> Been without internet because of an outage since noon, @Xfinity said it would be fixed by 3:30. 3:30 passes and now it says 11:00 PM üòëü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1293678977232576519 2020-08-12 18:41:18 EDT <DineroLunes> yeah let‚Äôs try to not have outages while the sun is out and stop being overpriced when nothing is on tv, just for starters üëçüèº
1293677961745510401 2020-08-12 18:37:16 EDT <THICCCBOIBODEE> @Xfinity outage went from 2:30 to 6:30 and now 10???? Come on, I shouldn‚Äôt be paying almost $200 for this, the last week has been absolutely ridiculous
1293676693090172928 2020-08-12 18:32:13 EDT <tattooedlwthes> @Xfinity can you please let me know if there‚Äôs an outage in the area code 71203? I‚Äôm not the account holder for my place and can‚Äôt check the app but I haven‚Äôt been able to use the WiFi since 3:30 yesterday. I just really need an update.
1293673385277435909 2020-08-12 18:19:04 EDT <markomni> .@comcastcares is the Xfinity outage affecting ZIP 60193 really expected to last until Saturday?!  pic.twitter.com/clFn1UJoOt
1293673025846599680 2020-08-12 18:17:39 EDT <bbykeeeks> you tell me there‚Äôs an outage till friday ü•¥
1293668569906126849 2020-08-12 17:59:56 EDT <thatgurl_zoie> Xfinity always got an outage in my area üôÑüôÑ. When I need my internet the mostüòë
1293668569163730944 2020-08-12 17:59:56 EDT <Nevermore360> I‚Äôve had internet ALL day and at 5 pm tonight and last night @Xfinity @comcastcares @comcast shuts it off. You call them and ‚Äúthey are aware of the outage‚Äù. WHY have it all day and now all a sudden I don‚Äôt have it for the rest of the night?! So angry!
1293662856030887940 2020-08-12 17:37:14 EDT <MrEandre> The app says there are no outages in my area.  We had a technician come out last week.  They said our equipment is fine.  The internet keeps shutting down.  Ive called too many times and all they do is reset it.
1293661220902404096 2020-08-12 17:30:44 EDT <tall_moll> this is inexcusable. what is the reason for the outage? why don't you have ANYONE available to actually speak with? why are customers routed through the same worthless pre-recorded messages? you're a joke of a company. here i come @RCNconnects!
1293660971165253632 2020-08-12 17:29:45 EDT <tall_moll> that's not good enough. how does an outage take 5 DAYS to fix? my livelihood depends on my ability to access the internet. does your myaccount app also compensate me for time lost & damage done to my job because i can't work??
1293660668592259075 2020-08-12 17:28:33 EDT <MrEandre> Are there alternatives to @Xfinity @comcast in Baltimore?  I can't deal with these outages and poor customer service anymore.
1293660608928387074 2020-08-12 17:28:18 EDT <Doe_Commander> When will my internet be restored due to the outage? @comcast @Xfinity @comcastcares #comcastoutage
1293660128063954945 2020-08-12 17:26:24 EDT <tall_moll> @comcast @Xfinity this is an absolute joke. when the entire country is working from home, you have a massive outage & don't even have a human being available to speak with?? and my service won't be back on until friday afternoon? this should be illegal. switching providers
1293653397611188224 2020-08-12 16:59:39 EDT <Jessie__Nails> @Xfinity another god damn internet outage! All of America is WFH right now and you still can‚Äôt get your shit together! Please put ‚Äúfuck Comcast‚Äù on my tombstone.
1293651883547144193 2020-08-12 16:53:38 EDT <MJayLaflaree> Everything I use except my phone run off Wifi & Xfinity done had a fuckin outage since Monday üòíü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1293649324346183680 2020-08-12 16:43:28 EDT <NdnaJnz> @Xfinity @comcast At the start of perhaps the most important event to at least half the country, you decide to do maintenance and take down 7 neighborhoods. I will weigh this outage to decide how much I should reduce my pmt this month.
1293649278905319428 2020-08-12 16:43:17 EDT <Xfinity> We apologize for the issues. Are you in an area outage currently, or see any area issues in your My Account app?
1293648447149572100 2020-08-12 16:39:59 EDT <Xfinity> If there's an outage in the area, it can affect your service regardless of your internet tier.
1293646577031090177 2020-08-12 16:32:33 EDT <Xfinity> Hi. Does your My Account app indicate that there is an outage in the area?
1293643786799677444 2020-08-12 16:21:28 EDT <cynthiagmurillo> @Xfinity another outage in my area or are you ‚Äúdoing maintenance‚Äù again? I want to be credited for the time I‚Äôve lost. Also the money I‚Äôm losing by not being able to work
1293643367738486799 2020-08-12 16:19:48 EDT <Xfinity> Does your My Account app indicate that you're in an outage?

1293636815119740928 2020-08-12 15:53:45 EDT <steveproffit> @Xfinity had an outage in my neighborhood last week and has not filly recovered. Not a great time to wfh.
1293636284133638145 2020-08-12 15:51:39 EDT <Chiraq_pride05> Fuck @Xfinity  and their fucking tradh wifi theres been an outage every day for the last fuckin 3 days bro what the fuck is this bullshit
1293636207927341057 2020-08-12 15:51:21 EDT <xBLOODofOMEGAx> @Xfinity for real a 3 day outage? How does this even happen. My power and internet were fine when a tornado popped down a mile away. Some people use wifi. Nobody should be charged these 3 days
1293632328644931585 2020-08-12 15:35:56 EDT <emilyluvsboston> @comcast @Xfinity is there an outage in the Boston area? üò†
1293630557927231497 2020-08-12 15:28:54 EDT <Xfinity> Oh no! Definitely not the experience we want for you. When the internet isn't working are you seeing any reports of an outage on the Xfinity My Account app? And how are you connected to your gateway? By ethernet cable or over WiFi? Let us know what troubleshooting you've tried.
1293619537947103232 2020-08-12 14:45:06 EDT <CoachHumphry93> Past 2 days we go from having a outage to having internet for a couple hours back to an outage. @Xfinity needs to get their stuff together. Should not take until Saturday to have it fixed.
1293619241145507842 2020-08-12 14:43:56 EDT <susanbruch> Almost on hour 3 of Xfinity outage with 3 more hours to go. Please tell me something amazing took out cable and internet. Like fried squirrel or aliens or .... Atlanta johns creek Alpharetta Forsyth County FoCo
1293618265307176960 2020-08-12 14:40:03 EDT <EmmaKatez> My internet from @Xfinity has been down four times in the past two weeks for HOURS at a time. I work from HOME and teach five hour classes. Tethering is not a suitable option for me. Customer support is zero help and these outages are unexplained and I‚Äôm not notified they happen.
1293617141506285570 2020-08-12 14:35:35 EDT <Xfinity> Oh no! Does the My Account app list an area outage?
1293617140461862912 2020-08-12 14:35:35 EDT <jayvesce> @Xfinity thanks for having an outage right in the middle of the workday.
1293615996306161664 2020-08-12 14:31:02 EDT <Xfinity> Hi. Does the My Account app list an area outage when the service goes down?
1293614549715824640 2020-08-12 14:25:17 EDT <Xfinity> Does the My Account app list an area outage?
1293612889966891010 2020-08-12 14:18:41 EDT <Xfinity> Hey there. Let's get you back up and running. Have you used the Xfinity My Account app to troubleshoot the WiFi connection or to see if there was an active outage in the area?
1293611881945616384 2020-08-12 14:14:41 EDT <liz_powers13> In Indiana we would always say Xfinity was the worst Internet Service Provider. I gotta say though, I would take Xfinity over @optimum any day. It sucks that we have had a known outage for almost two weeks now (since before the storm) and they have yet to fix, but they'd gladly
1293610763899346945 2020-08-12 14:10:14 EDT <MarcoGodAK> The 15th of august which is in line with com Eds estimated time to fix the outages even tho my power is fine
1293610465424297986 2020-08-12 14:09:03 EDT <Xfinity> Understood, thank you for the info. We're working to fix the issue ASAP, are you seeing any estimated end time for this outage?
1293610372436504576 2020-08-12 14:08:41 EDT <kurtpafford> Tech scheduled for today, but y‚Äôall called last night and said y‚Äôall were working in the area, and that‚Äôs why I was having outages. They said everything should be fine, so they canceled my tech visit. I called to reschedule today and they told me they can send a tech out tomorrow
1293609834965803009 2020-08-12 14:06:33 EDT <MarcoGodAK> It says there‚Äôs an outage right after com ed brought power back
1293609834856808454 2020-08-12 14:06:33 EDT <kurtpafford> Hardwire...we‚Äôve gone through resets all week. I keep having to go through the automated helpline. Tech came out said line is fine. Replaced the modem and still having outages daily.
1293608423737757697 2020-08-12 14:00:56 EDT <Xfinity> Do you know if the My Account app listed an area outage when it went down?
1293606119491936257 2020-08-12 13:51:47 EDT <Xfinity> Hi. If you're in an area outage, keep an eye on your My Account app for updates as they are available.
1293605772547493894 2020-08-12 13:50:24 EDT <TonyaWi13471971> @Xfinity are we getting credits for the storm outage
1293604994327994377 2020-08-12 13:47:19 EDT <IvanPav94193854> Care to make a statement on the outage?
1293604857098784768 2020-08-12 13:46:46 EDT <Xfinity> Have you been checking the Xfinity My Account app? Are these interruptions outages or in the quality of your WiFi connection?
1293602811284992000 2020-08-12 13:38:38 EDT <mrsdb18> @Xfinity is it possible for us to get an ETA for when our outage from Mondays storm is expected to be resolved?
1293601356675252224 2020-08-12 13:32:52 EDT <Scotty_Loading> I didn‚Äôt pay for ‚Äúoutages‚Äù get it together smh
1293597749724684288 2020-08-12 13:18:32 EDT <jflory7> Almost a total broadband Internet blackout. What's going on? @comcastcares @Xfinity is a dead upstream for Internet connection. Hearing reports about outages across southeast but I can't find any data or confirmed sources. #Atlanta #ATL #comcastoutage
1293597074886459393 2020-08-12 13:15:51 EDT <AngieGa56642465> @comcast @Xfinity Internet outage in Chicago day 3 with an ETA for restoration on FRIDAY NIGHT? If they even bother to meet that deadline. People are working/schooling from home, and not even an explanation provided to us. Ridiculous. Can‚Äôt wait to change ISPs. #comcastoutage
1293592403773816835 2020-08-12 12:57:17 EDT <MicheleTobias> I'm guessing this outage has something to do with PG&E (infamous power and gas company) tearing up the street a few blocks away.
1293588630007685121 2020-08-12 12:42:17 EDT <AniAnge96041186> @Xfinity I need you to please put a rush on fixing Northeast Philly and fix the outage. 4pm ETA is Not the ideal ETA being that it's been out since 12
1293587038646743040 2020-08-12 12:35:58 EDT <arpieb> @Xfinity #wtf can't I screencap or share network outage details from your so-called Customer Service app to let members of my household know what's up?  #comcastoutage #xfinityoutage
1293586606042079232 2020-08-12 12:34:15 EDT <mchigh_marty> There‚Äôs a fucking Xfinity outage every couple weeks in my neighborhood this shot is starting to get ridiculous @Xfinity @comcast
1293583818767708161 2020-08-12 12:23:10 EDT <YourFellowArab> Btw, the last time xfinity had an outage this big was on my last charity stream for St Jude.  Not sure if it's like karma from mother nature or something but it only ever happens during my 24h charity streams... so weird.
1293583645123387392 2020-08-12 12:22:29 EDT <qtFonsed> how can u just always have outages like xfinity is so ass
1293582859614269441 2020-08-12 12:19:21 EDT <YourFellowArab> Lmaooo I called Xfinity & they said there's an outage till 6pm... gg.
1293581426785431553 2020-08-12 12:13:40 EDT <cierra63274604> XFINITY really have an outage in my area & my internet out!!!! No work üò≠üò©
1293575324731674625 2020-08-12 11:49:25 EDT <gauravkanoongo> @comcastcares Your @Xfinity internet services are disrupted in Windsor, 06095 CT area since August 4th 2020. An ETA to fix the issue was given as August 11, 2020 6 PM but since today morning there is again outage. Could you provide a realistic ETA to permanently restore services?
1293572464463798278 2020-08-12 11:38:03 EDT <jratke> What is going on with the massive @Xfinity outage here in Chicago? They say it will be resolved on the 14th?!?
1293570848922546177 2020-08-12 11:31:38 EDT <RRogerRabbitT94> I feel like Xfinity has more outages than the Jeff Epstein Netflix Special!
1293567194509574145 2020-08-12 11:17:07 EDT <cjbydesign> @Xfinity this sucks! I just paid my bill, I have the fastest internet speed but there has been an internet outage in my area for 3 days and it‚Äôs still not fixed! I work from home and have missed work for 2 days now!
1293565630231322625 2020-08-12 11:10:54 EDT <KevyRe> Xfinity WiFi been having a outages for three now ... ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôÑ
1293560311170109440 2020-08-12 10:49:46 EDT <tkloss98> Just moved our 2 college guys in Sunday. Terrible customer service and almost zero internet since Sunday. Told can‚Äôt have tech come out until all outage issues fixed. They start school Monday! Worst decision and worst cust service. @Ask_Spectrum do you cover Rockford Illinois ?
1293558579186868228 2020-08-12 10:42:53 EDT <comcast> Hi Elyse. You can check the Xfinity My Account app for the most updated outage information. -Gabbie
1293553284846882816 2020-08-12 10:21:50 EDT <RebelliaRose> @comcastcares so 1st day of v-schooling and already an #outage üëèüèªüëèüèª not 2 mention, you replied to dm you about my previous post and in the photos you‚Äôll see how #caring n #helpful you‚Äôve really been. I want my #bill #discounted for every #outage so how do we do that?? #xfinity  pic.twitter.com/r7VgpLBLGl
1293551478695776256 2020-08-12 10:14:40 EDT <cammyct> @Xfinity what is the deal with Internet being out for a week, ok - power outage. Power on and internet is NOT!!! FIX IT!
1293551182481371136 2020-08-12 10:13:29 EDT <bpmckenna> @RCNconnects instead of providing us with generic responses about this outage, how about an ACTUAL ETA? At least Xfinity, despite all its flaws, has given clearer estimates.
1293549686930968576 2020-08-12 10:07:33 EDT <Ndv334> Probably will be switching from @Xfinity really soon. This outage mess is way too inconvenient.
1293549142321410048 2020-08-12 10:05:23 EDT <sanomanjirou> xfinity stay having outages.....
1293549015703998464 2020-08-12 10:04:52 EDT <Julian_Santana7> Yea getting my services turned back on talking about an outage and then y‚Äôall got this smart ass pre record as agent. Fix this ASAP.
1293539926412337157 2020-08-12 09:28:45 EDT <DjHustlenomics> Fix It ASAP It‚Äôs Sunny As Hell Outside For A 9AM Outage @Xfinity
1293538846261547008 2020-08-12 09:24:28 EDT <rjmiller22> @Xfinity working from home is becoming a greater challenge by the day with your constant outages and issues. Why do we pay a premium for your service when it constantly has issues!!! #poorservice
1293537855202111488 2020-08-12 09:20:32 EDT <Shimmy_Nupetron> @Xfinity Now I can‚Äôt do my work. Because there‚Äôs an outage issue ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1293537400623370240 2020-08-12 09:18:43 EDT <Xfinity> You can check the Xfinity My Account app for the most updated outage information.
1293536286058348544 2020-08-12 09:14:17 EDT <GregWMcClure> I am on Xfinity Mobile which uses your wireless network. My calls have been dropping since Monday (or not even completing) and my texts are off and on going through. Plus, data off and on working as well. Is there an outage in my area (60545)?
1293533985864327168 2020-08-12 09:05:09 EDT <Cait_lopes> 10 min before nicks about to leave to go back to work since Aryas been born and our internet goes out üëåüèª even better....Xfinity says there‚Äôs a huge outage in our area and it won‚Äôt be back on until August 15th. üëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèª

1293530982021308423 2020-08-12 08:53:13 EDT <Xfinity> We know it's frustrating to be without services. You can check the Xfinity My Account app for the most updated outage information.
1293530519997743110 2020-08-12 08:51:23 EDT <okmogwai> while they report we will have internet outage for almost a whole week. thanks üñïüèΩ #xfinity ü§¨ #workfromhome https://twitter.com/xfinity/status/1250892742206595080¬†‚Ä¶
1293528989722607618 2020-08-12 08:45:18 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Randy, here are some alternative ways to report an outage:  https://xfin.tv/31QwYZQ¬†.
1293527780395823108 2020-08-12 08:40:30 EDT <iAm_Cookies> Another outage...grrreat. #xfinity
1293525397137772544 2020-08-12 08:31:01 EDT <RADarnell> @Xfinity I‚Äôve been trying to call to report a service outage where I live, but every time I call I get put on hold for anywhere from 22-44 minutes and then it just hangs up. I just want my internet fixed please?! I haven‚Äôt had internet since Monday afternoon!
1293519494451732480 2020-08-12 08:07:34 EDT <markmongo> Optimum wasn't any better, no outage maps, no estimates of restorations of service. Just awful
1293517060694249473 2020-08-12 07:57:54 EDT <xgolferx> @Xfinity Yet outage notification on app is indicating 11:33pm on 08/14/2020  That would be painful ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  pic.twitter.com/gUSBuARIXK
1293516520858034177 2020-08-12 07:55:45 EDT <xgolferx> @Xfinity So text alert seems to indicate internet outage should be fixed by 11:33pm   I took that to mean today...  pic.twitter.com/2HMGRLEtFf
1293516011669463040 2020-08-12 07:53:44 EDT <mayration> @Xfinity... really? An outage expected for a whole week? That's IF this estimate is correct and you don't decide to move it again for the 4th time. You do realize people need this to work from home, right?
1293474397089607680 2020-08-12 05:08:22 EDT <Slatt00> @Xfinity been 2 days since this outage an still no changesü•¥
1293425081159503873 2020-08-12 01:52:24 EDT <AkenoSucks> Lmao xfinity fucking me over dude, outages galore
1293424763067600896 2020-08-12 01:51:08 EDT <Im_TSG> Yay once again @Xfinity u guys disappoint me. Every week yall have some stupid outage in our area wtf is going on we pay for high speed internet and dont even get it wr just get outages and slow speeds
1293421592337416193 2020-08-12 01:38:32 EDT <_MOCHACHINO_> Xfinity outage until 6am I swear I‚Äôll jump off a bridge
1293408497657405440 2020-08-12 00:46:30 EDT <ACHforCongress> This is the issue I have with big ISP's and probably why they lobby so hard to get away with things.  How are you working and the network goes out only to find there's a planned outage but @Xfinity didn't plan to tell you so you could make arrangements?  pic.twitter.com/XztBk3pWTB
1293406128735424512 2020-08-12 00:37:06 EDT <ACHforCongress> My thoughts exactly how are you working on something and the network drops to see it's a planned outage but you have nothing telling you to plan on your end?
1293401737341079553 2020-08-12 00:19:39 EDT <golourdesduarte> well now there were outages unrelated to my own issue, so I‚Äôm trying to get credited cause they‚Äôre billing me for this month. üò≠
1293400196135583744 2020-08-12 00:13:31 EDT <Gcbuilder3> @Xfinity it's been 7 days with xfinity wifi outage here in California I have to use  my friends internet which is the only thing I have for my phone that is good
1293391037805875201 2020-08-11 23:37:08 EDT <TheGrandDucky> @Xfinity what are you doing about the outages in Chicago? I'm paying for internet and by the way it looks I'll be without it for a week.
1293389334431830016 2020-08-11 23:30:21 EDT <KhalifaNoWiz> @Xfinity it‚Äôs day 3 of outages!! What‚Äôs going on
1293389076196986880 2020-08-11 23:29:20 EDT <TheKyrill91> @comcast @Xfinity @comcastcares Does Comcast ever resolve an area outage before the estimated date? Asking for a friend.
1293385850630307841 2020-08-11 23:16:31 EDT <SouthSiderKB> @Xfinity please restore our internet so I can watch @AEWrestling #AEWDynamite Wednesday night!  #outages #storms
1293381085301178368 2020-08-11 22:57:35 EDT <clairedsmith_> @Xfinity how do I get a credit on my account for the service outage that has interrupted my service for 24+ hours?
1293375377834901504 2020-08-11 22:34:54 EDT <lovelyquiraa_> @Xfinity can y‚Äôall please fix the outage ü•¥ Me and my homegirl @davibaee just wanna watch tv and use our laptops üò≠
1293374363228667906 2020-08-11 22:30:52 EDT <golourdesduarte> an @Xfinity outage yesterday, a week with lame WiFi and after having a tech come today my WiFi is down AGAIN. chatted @comcastcares about a statement credit that was offered by an agent and now they‚Äôve gone radio silent. @Webpass - whats good?
1293374107606753281 2020-08-11 22:29:51 EDT <ireta1423> After the promised resolution last night mine just says ‚Äúas soon as possible‚Äù. I appreciate this was a bad storm and lots of outages but just sending us back to the site with no info is not helpful.
1293372169863467008 2020-08-11 22:22:09 EDT <yilmaz_yildirim> @Xfinity A three day internet outage!!! Have you lost your mind?  pic.twitter.com/6iD2cYUVIU
1293370036577603587 2020-08-11 22:13:41 EDT <MegThomasReile> Dear #Xfinity telling us that the outage will be fixed ASAP is meaningless when I see that most of my neighbors have service and I‚Äòbe not seen one truck in the hood all day.
1293369979509907456 2020-08-11 22:13:27 EDT <Rayzer_14> An unplanned outage? On a clear weather day when you guys already ‚Äúfixed it‚Äù earlier today? Come on‚Ä¶ Very disappointing  pic.twitter.com/w3JZdynf4i
1293368113996718090 2020-08-11 22:06:02 EDT <brentbrookhouse> So after surviving life with kids in a power outage in the summer, the power just popped on. Only for me to find out there is an xfinity outage. And, as always with @Xfinity, it‚Äôs impossible to get updates of anything like a general ETA of services being restored.
1293366405518307328 2020-08-11 21:59:15 EDT <flychicken5000> @Xfinity If you have Comcast you still miss out watching games because the Marquee app won‚Äôt list it as a provider. So whenever Comcast has an outage, which is often, you‚Äôre screwed!!
1293364109409386497 2020-08-11 21:50:07 EDT <Bearsfan8578> @comcast @Xfinity confuses me on updates for outages. They say they‚Äôll text you when it‚Äôs back on but is there a way to get an estimate? We are working from home and need to make plans!
1293363251309424640 2020-08-11 21:46:43 EDT <danushman> funny thing is- I was just calling for a status update on an outage...something that your agent was readily able to give me once I finally got through... This is simple information that is strangely missing from the recorded messages about the outage AND not post posted online.
1293361483045363715 2020-08-11 21:39:41 EDT <Teamycakes> Love the fact that it is literally functionally impossible to contact Comcast when you have an outage they say will be fixed in a week. #abolishComcast @Xfinity @comcastcares @comcast
1293356983605755904 2020-08-11 21:21:48 EDT <___coco______> There was an outage yesterday evening until 5 PM today (even though I got a text that my service was restored). I got home, restarted the box, still no internet or cable. I‚Äôve unplugged and replugged at least 10 times.  pic.twitter.com/NNifa58Ec2
1293356500136714240 2020-08-11 21:19:53 EDT <Xfinity> Hi. Does the Xfinity My Account app list an area outage?
1293354999586709505 2020-08-11 21:13:55 EDT <Kitiyara99> Us too üò¢Xfinity sucks! I think they are doing rolling blackouts. We had everything working when I got home at 4 but they said we had an outage at 5:30 and that it won‚Äôt be fixed until 2:30 tomorrow!!
1293353926033637378 2020-08-11 21:09:39 EDT <teon_greyjoy> @Xfinity @comcast when are you going to resolve the outage in Chicago? Some of us are working from home...with no internet. Your automated system doesn‚Äôt even forward me to a rep. Pls advise.
1293353391050174465 2020-08-11 21:07:32 EDT <_disalle> @Xfinity always on point with that outage. Dame gets the bounce for 61 and a tie game? Drop that coverage
1293350532376076288 2020-08-11 20:56:10 EDT <Xfinity> Hi. Are you in an area outage?
1293349028537593856 2020-08-11 20:50:12 EDT <FrecklesXX20> I'm so glad nothing was lost in the power outage. Stay safe!!
1293345987147321344 2020-08-11 20:38:07 EDT <sterno> @Xfinity I am so livid with your customer service right now.  I have had an Internet outage for over a day without any updates on when it might be resolved.  I cannot do my job if I do not have Internet.  I need a status
1293342774612365318 2020-08-11 20:25:21 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked your My Account app or  http://xfin.tv/status¬† to see if you're affected by an outage?
1293342322671996928 2020-08-11 20:23:33 EDT <blakeruane> Can't believe I've been pushed this far, but when vast swaths of people are WFH during a pandemic, you'd think @Xfinity would communicate better (i.e. at all) during a 12-hour+ internet outage so people can make plans accordingly
1293341398553563136 2020-08-11 20:19:53 EDT <Maryagnes116> Here‚Äôs the outage map.  pic.twitter.com/CPckeEshrk
1293338543394299906 2020-08-11 20:08:32 EDT <katdiaz2011> I've called several times today and still having issues with the internet but it says "no outage" in my area - HELP!!!
1293335401587970048 2020-08-11 19:56:03 EDT <AightThatsCool> Who in MD is apart of the xfinity outage? Would only connect for like 3 minutes then stop.
1293331790162264065 2020-08-11 19:41:42 EDT <NGNAkimbo> Where do you live city wise mine is also down and I‚Äôm trying to figure out if it‚Äôs an outage in my area
1293331250061680643 2020-08-11 19:39:33 EDT <Xfinity> Are you seeing any outage information in your My Account app?
1293326581193220098 2020-08-11 19:21:00 EDT <Xfinity> Hi. We're sorry for the inconvenience the interruption has caused, and our techs are working to restore the service as quickly as possible. Be sure to check the My Account app for updates on the area outage.
1293324549149405188 2020-08-11 19:12:55 EDT <LynJer18> @Xfinity how long is it gonna take to fix these outages?!üò©
1293322902171983873 2020-08-11 19:06:23 EDT <xlovedsammyx> @Xfinity Are you serious? There‚Äôs been an outage in Chicago since 8 last night and now it‚Äôs going to be out until 8/14? My family works from home and needs this for our jobs! This needs to be resolved ASAP.
1293320321228038145 2020-08-11 18:56:07 EDT <Xfinity> Hi. Does the My Account app list an area outage ongoing at this time?
1293317533253197824 2020-08-11 18:45:03 EDT <Chicago_Todd> @Xfinity You seriously have an outage in Chicago that won't be resolved until August 14, five days after it went out? And no one will take my call about this?
1293317359831326725 2020-08-11 18:44:21 EDT <Xfinity> Is the service down at this time? If so, does the Xfinity My Account app list an area outage?
1293315576933363714 2020-08-11 18:37:16 EDT <KirstenMcC1> @Xfinity Fix the internets (no more outages in DuPage County, pls)  pic.twitter.com/SxTYuv2aRM
1293315133628993539 2020-08-11 18:35:31 EDT <Xfinity> Hi. Does your My Account app indicate that you've been in an area outage this whole time?
1293312990134108163 2020-08-11 18:27:00 EDT <Xfinity> Are you seeing any area outage information in your My Account app?
1293312103927906306 2020-08-11 18:23:28 EDT <cardinalc0pia> xfinity has unfortunately told me there‚Äôs an outage in my area and i just have to wait so guess i‚Äôll be passing away
1293309462590234624 2020-08-11 18:12:59 EDT <25_wale> @Xfinity @comcastcares Why are outages taking 3 days to be fixed?
1293309269148934145 2020-08-11 18:12:12 EDT <datagoon> These unplanned @xfinity Internet outages are making me thirsty (for a new ISP)
1293308022282952704 2020-08-11 18:07:15 EDT <Invest2TheBest> @Xfinity @comcastcares There is a outage here in Chicago. Any idea when services will be restored?? I work from home..
1293306444582989824 2020-08-11 18:00:59 EDT <DennisCMcMahon> Xfinity/Comcast super outage of nearly 12 hours duration in N. Burlington VT requires an explanation.
1293305426294067209 2020-08-11 17:56:56 EDT <MrsJ2001> @comcastcares @Xfinity @comcast Eight days with no service, to my entire neighborhood, and all you can say is you are aware of the outage and it will be restored soon??  Send a truck and fix it! This is absurd!! #xfinity #comcast #outage
1293304999200452608 2020-08-11 17:55:14 EDT <kylehunt00> @Xfinity is there an outage in the Santa Cruz area? My modem has been down for three hours or so even after resetting it.
1293304925452197892 2020-08-11 17:54:57 EDT <tall_moll> @Xfinity you are, bar none, the most worthless, horrific cable & internet provider on the planet. A cable/internet outage that‚Äôs going to take until Friday to resolve while literally everyone is working from home? Fuck you. You‚Äôre a joke
1293303488353533952 2020-08-11 17:49:14 EDT <Rpeeters33> Have officially had to resort to using my phone as a hotspot and buying prepaid Xfinity internet as I have been unable to talk to a real person at AT&T all day. Approaching 17 hours of this service outage. Somehow managed to schedule a tech for Thursday
1293301515046793220 2020-08-11 17:41:24 EDT <25_wale> @Xfinity @comcastcares I wanna know why this Outage in my area won‚Äôt be fixed for another 3 Days?
1293301039492485120 2020-08-11 17:39:30 EDT <Xfinity> We can help out with the internet issues. Do you know if the My Account app is listing a service outage in the area when you notice the service go down?
1293299910805266433 2020-08-11 17:35:01 EDT <vthreee> Yes it is!! Lol I‚Äôve wasted 2 days working with their customer service. Even went out and bought my own modem and it‚Äôs still not working. Don‚Äôt bother. Every person tells you the same thing. There is no outage, and you just have to keep restarting your modem until it works.
1293297138617786372 2020-08-11 17:24:00 EDT <alyse8715> @Xfinity what the hell is going? I was told the outage was resolved at 3:44 pm and now I‚Äôm being told it will be resolved in 3 days. Are you freaking kidding me?!
1293295145396457473 2020-08-11 17:16:05 EDT <ArtcelQ> @Xfinity @ComcastILLINOIS @comcastcares  It‚Äôs been more than 24 hours since the outage in OakPark, IL. We need to work.
1293292848524201986 2020-08-11 17:06:57 EDT <Xfinity> Sorry for the frustration. Are you in an area outage?
1293291658164031493 2020-08-11 17:02:14 EDT <staciabarbosa> Love it when @Xfinity @comcastcares leaves all their customers in the dark with vague information on actually outage updates. This is fine. Great service. Love that this should have been fixed by 6 this morning and now it won't be fixed until 4pm on Friday.  pic.twitter.com/aEEDhV9ySm
1293290747022708738 2020-08-11 16:58:36 EDT <aschalee> @Xfinity we‚Äôve been without internet in 60625 since 8 last night. now you‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs going to be THREE DAYS until the outage is resolved?! what gives?
1293289642460995589 2020-08-11 16:54:13 EDT <sillycookieluv> So @Xfinity has these new ads for gaming level internet speeds...my Wi-Fi crashes every single day. If it doesn‚Äôt crash there‚Äôs and outage. Gaming level speeds my ass. #whydoipayforthis #Xfinity
1293287827124494336 2020-08-11 16:47:00 EDT <badwolftequila> Was so ready to stream today but Xfinity had other plans. Internet outage with no real timeline of having it back up again. FML
1293284443201757184 2020-08-11 16:33:33 EDT <ScarletCleo> @comcastcares @comcast @Xfinity  Can someone explain, when paying for Gigabit internet, that in the past 30 days it's a weekly occurrence that my internet craps out in the afternoon? #workfromhome  I know I currently have an outage, but this lack of reliability is unacceptable!
1293284187752013824 2020-08-11 16:32:33 EDT <vthreee> It‚Äôs dropping over here in sugar land too, but none of the agents care bc their outmap says there is no outage.
1293284033791549441 2020-08-11 16:31:56 EDT <JtFinlay> I'm getting an @Xfinity outage daily this week. üòæ
1293283585189801984 2020-08-11 16:30:09 EDT <vthreee> Yup tons of issues, but they‚Äôre not showing up on their agents outage map, so they‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs not a real issue..
1293279706624729089 2020-08-11 16:14:44 EDT <LindsR13> @Xfinity I‚Äôm incredibly disappointed with my Comcast service in chicago, IL. There has been an outage for almost 24 hours and I am unable to complete work and attend meetings. I‚Äôve been looking for answers all day..please help!
1293279665461899267 2020-08-11 16:14:34 EDT <THEZEEMATRON> @Xfinity CAN YOU FIX THE WIFI IS THERE AN OUTAGE IN BALTIMORE
1293278361742192640 2020-08-11 16:09:24 EDT <Xfinity> We're sorry for the inconvenience the downtime has caused. The My Account app will provide area outage updates, so be sure to check there.
1293277283915096064 2020-08-11 16:05:07 EDT <Bustronaut> No movement on getting our power restored until I told Xfinity their giant outage would last until our utility pole got replaced.  20 minutes later a team was at our house.
1293272865970716672 2020-08-11 15:47:33 EDT <Bigbullybkp> Internet just dropped again ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è xfinity internet outage in my area! I can‚Äôt go a week without it going out
1293271405417492480 2020-08-11 15:41:45 EDT <Xfinity> If you're in an outage, be sure to keep an eye on your My Account app for updates.
1293269652706033664 2020-08-11 15:34:47 EDT <kivxo> Xfinity outage in my area... tbh I would appreciate if the issues remain until I get off of work üôÉ
1293267961734746113 2020-08-11 15:28:04 EDT <Xfinity> We apologize for the frustration, are you in an area outage?
1293267360552374273 2020-08-11 15:25:41 EDT <After9to5> @Xfinity Can you tell me if there's an outage in 64082?
1293266575240376322 2020-08-11 15:22:33 EDT <Dimples_216> Xfinity outage in the area....will try to play something after work.
1293266143860289536 2020-08-11 15:20:51 EDT <After9to5> Is there an outage in 64082? I'm in the Kansas City suburb of Lee's Summit MO.
1293265829275013120 2020-08-11 15:19:36 EDT <YO_TONIO> @Xfinity is there an outage in Atlanta or ...
1293265613993979905 2020-08-11 15:18:44 EDT <thevulgarone> Xfinity is getting on my nerves with these outages
1293264362426241024 2020-08-11 15:13:46 EDT <Xfinity> Hi! If you're in an area outage, be sure to keep an eye on the My Account app for updates.
1293263992169824260 2020-08-11 15:12:18 EDT <After9to5> Can you provide an outage map? I need to send to my boss.
1293260984916889607 2020-08-11 15:00:21 EDT <Xfinity> We can help, are you in an area outage currently?
1293259937305567235 2020-08-11 14:56:11 EDT <tokiohotel3191> @Xfinity you need to get it together with these outages. You're making it impossible to get things done üòíüòíüòí
1293259709777158146 2020-08-11 14:55:17 EDT <JoeyFyd6485> @Xfinity @comcastcares ANOTHER OUTAGE TODAY. Second day in a row. Another day of work lost. You just lost a long time customer because this keeps happening and you can‚Äôt figure it out. You are a JOKE #xfinity #comcast #xfinityoutage
1293258896904265732 2020-08-11 14:52:03 EDT <Xfinity> Hi. We're sorry for the inconvenience the interruption has caused, and our techs are working to get the service restored as quickly as possible. Local Xfinity hotspots may also be affected by the outage.
1293256103162257409 2020-08-11 14:40:57 EDT <ireta1423> Hey @Xfinity - weather related internet outage in Chgo heading toward the 24 hour mark with no further updates. Can‚Äôt seem to access local hot spot either. Any ideas? Pretty tough when we are working from home.
1293255743932706819 2020-08-11 14:39:31 EDT <vtaptap> @Xfinity I dunno why Comcast doesn't believe customers when they tell them there's an outage... I work at home and when I inform them of the outage, they tell me there's not problem
1293255478491914240 2020-08-11 14:38:28 EDT <Xfinity> Hi. Your My Account app does not state that you are affected by an outage?
1293255182537625600 2020-08-11 14:37:17 EDT <ldyrj_> xfinity been ‚Äúfixing‚Äù my outage since 9 am
1293252794187644928 2020-08-11 14:27:48 EDT <Davbar63> Xfinity service outage Royal Palm Beach!!!
1293243781257531395 2020-08-11 13:51:59 EDT <Xfinity> Hi. Sorry to hear you've been having issues. Have you checked your My account app to see if there is an outage affecting your area?
1293242926777208832 2020-08-11 13:48:35 EDT <Xfinity> Hi! Are you experiencing an area outage?
1293241695044165632 2020-08-11 13:43:42 EDT <queenmcthottie> I have never had so many connectivity issues w WiFi until I switched to @Xfinity   At least 2-3x a month, my connection just drops even though it says it‚Äôs connected and there are no outages.   @Xfinity a tech told me i need a new router. How do I go about that? @Xfinity
1293239742620930050 2020-08-11 13:35:56 EDT <davidrovani> "An @Xfinity Internet outage has been reported in your area. We're working hard to get your service up and running. The issue will be resolved 08/12/2020 12:13 AM (Central). Thank you for your patience." #ChicagoDerecho
1293233688852013056 2020-08-11 13:11:53 EDT <meganantoine> @Xfinity our whole neighborhood down but all the reps keep saying there is no outage in the area.  We all are getting scheduled for appointments tomorrow. How is that possible?  How can you not see that you've had multiple calls for the same area?
1293232680084156420 2020-08-11 13:07:52 EDT <tiaraaanicole> Xfinity literally has an outage every other day
1293232133629259776 2020-08-11 13:05:42 EDT <ErinRydberg> Same. I can actually get fired since Comcast will not provide a letter of outage and no response from anyone and was promised it would be back up and running at 750am no scheduled to 9pm. Every neighborhood around me is running but mine.
1293231931534999559 2020-08-11 13:04:54 EDT <silversj> I love the app - so far it has always been outages and the app says that "a technician is performing maintenance" in my area.
1293231463048056832 2020-08-11 13:03:02 EDT <Xfinity> Hey Grace! You're still in the outage from yesterday? Did you verify with the Xfinity My Account app yet? You may just need to restart your gateway.
1293229706641379331 2020-08-11 12:56:03 EDT <Xfinity> I know how frustrating outages can be Irma. What is the Xfinity My Account app saying? Are they outages or planned maintenance?
1293229242394849281 2020-08-11 12:54:13 EDT <Xfinity> Working from home definitely has its set of unique challenges - let's not be one of them! When you say your service goes down in the middle of the day, do you check the Xfinity My Account app? I ask so we can figure out if it's a WiFi issue or outages happening in the area.
1293226306205896713 2020-08-11 12:42:33 EDT <IrmaAldineISD> @Xfinity can you please stop having internet outages during the day?
1293223451793281026 2020-08-11 12:31:12 EDT <KennedyCamillee> @Xfinity count your days!!! It‚Äôs been a outage for two days get it together üò°
1293221828811468800 2020-08-11 12:24:45 EDT <KolorsofKeish> Y‚Äôall are the WORST @Xfinity  Why would your tech leave my box like this? Pretty sure it‚Äôs related to the outages I‚Äôm having EVERYDAY  pic.twitter.com/allGMMhpl2
1293214163758710785 2020-08-11 11:54:18 EDT <YeahOkayZach> @Xfinity @comcastcares hey, is there an outage in the city of Chicago?
1293204969882112001 2020-08-11 11:17:46 EDT <garmaikm> @Xfinity I‚Äôm going on almost 24 hours with no WiFi or cable services. This outage is ridiculous. What is the solution and when will it be used to fix this problem??? Y‚Äôall know people are working from home....this is a HUGE inconvenience right now.
1293203231875661830 2020-08-11 11:10:51 EDT <Chiraq_pride05> @Xfinity  fix the goddamn outage i havent had wifi all night in Chicago
1293202119860932608 2020-08-11 11:06:26 EDT <adama_anthony> @Xfinity what‚Äôs going on with the outages in CT ?
1293198697489215488 2020-08-11 10:52:50 EDT <MattLanus> @comcastcares @Xfinity I understand that there was a powerful storm last yesterday, but I have had WiFi outage for almost 17 hours! This is ridiculous! Will I get reimbursed for the time that xfinity has not provided the service it has promised?
1293197835651948545 2020-08-11 10:49:25 EDT <theAsakura_> Nothing like working from home during a pandemic and having @Xfinity have a surprise service outage that won‚Äôt be resolved until 6:29PM...are you serious with this?
1293196632901722112 2020-08-11 10:44:38 EDT <Geo_Kris> @comcastcares please explain to me why our @Xfinity internet has gone out 3 days in a row now? 1.5 months at our new place and every week has at least 1 outage. This is not acceptable!
1293193838748749824 2020-08-11 10:33:32 EDT <Xfinity> You can check the Xfinity My Account app for the most updated outage information or to troubleshoot!

1293189172166107136 2020-08-11 10:14:59 EDT <SexHarassed> This #CCP outage is like what @comcast @Xfinity has done to #LauraLoomer, which is why #LauraLoomerForCongress is gaining even more steam.
1293187465872683008 2020-08-11 10:08:12 EDT <twinswild71> @Xfinity widespread internet outage in neighborhood yet you claim there is no outage. Several people have reported it, all getting appointments for tomorrow. My guess is you have an outage. Just sayin‚Äô
1293186784378068993 2020-08-11 10:05:30 EDT <CJade819> @Xfinity Our internet #outage has been going on since 11pm last night. Can you provide a #status ASAP please on when this is approximately supposed to be fixed? Need the WiFi to work on our generator for my job.
1293185539609247745 2020-08-11 10:00:33 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Linda. You can check for service outages in your area using the My Account app. You can download the My Account app here:  https://xfin.tv/2DFj5W0¬†.

1293174109116014592 2020-08-11 09:15:08 EDT <TheTylerHBeaty> @Xfinity how come when I try to understand why there is an outage I can‚Äôt reach a real person ever??? You have delayed this repair by 12 hours and those forced to work from home can‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt contact anyone for answers or some credit to my account. I‚Äôm sick of this
1293168742575345664 2020-08-11 08:53:48 EDT <BerlinDelia> My brother has Xfinity and his presumed outage was a tripped switch from a brownout. I don‚Äôt have specifics, but if you haven‚Äôt tried it yet, reset everything, including power strips. ü§ûüèª

1293127497043922944 2020-08-11 06:09:55 EDT <danz740> Hey, @Xfinity A projected 4 day outage two days after a 4 day outage is unacceptable. About to become a former customer.
1293086122076180480 2020-08-11 03:25:30 EDT <antaneiisha> the day i wanna watch tv xfinity wanna have a outage
1293082788422451201 2020-08-11 03:12:15 EDT <TimmyJay93> One day before our Xfinity service ends there‚Äôs an outage in the area. Go figure.
1293076430675423232 2020-08-11 02:46:59 EDT <The_Atomic_Cat> Well mine is now, it was still out for a few hours but xfinity told me they wouldn't fix the outage until next morning. Also you live in the city, that's probably why. There's a much higher demand to fix those things asap.
1293042049386786817 2020-08-11 00:30:22 EDT <DennisCMcMahon> Xfinity service restored after "historic" lengthy outage in N. Burlington, VT. Civilization is restored before VT primary day dawns.
1293040251720671232 2020-08-11 00:23:14 EDT <pazza__bella> I did that that‚Äôs how I know that between 1-50 people in my zip code are experiencing the outage but all of the customer service reps insist that it‚Äôs not affecting me.  pic.twitter.com/NzgVraCBDl
1293038573185269760 2020-08-11 00:16:33 EDT <88_peeps> We had terrible problems with outages a month ago, but went to the Xfinity store and picked up a new router and it‚Äôs been about 90% better.
1293034830368845824 2020-08-11 00:01:41 EDT <pazza__bella> @Xfinity at least if I could show my boss there‚Äôs an outage I might be able to go into the office rather than take the day off.. but no it‚Äôs an isolated incident at my house 150 of my neighbors are having similar but different issues
1293034348845899776 2020-08-10 23:59:46 EDT <pazza__bella> @Xfinity there are 3-150 in my zip code and the 2 adjacent zip codes experiencing an outage.. my internet like theirs isn‚Äôt working but the customer service reps insist I‚Äôm not affected by it üôÑ
1293030384406425601 2020-08-10 23:44:01 EDT <katothepug> @Xfinity this internet/tv/phone outage in the 98444 zip that has been going on for hours is really cramping my √ºber binge lifestyle. Please fix this ASAP.  #FirstWorldProblems
1293026148822265856 2020-08-10 23:27:11 EDT <DennisCMcMahon> You need to work a little harder to fix the outrageous outage of over 11 hours in the 05408 area of Burlington VT. Eve of primary complicates the inconvenience.
1293025761767587841 2020-08-10 23:25:39 EDT <DennisCMcMahon> @Xfinity Outrageous outage in New North End of Burlington VT now approaching over 11 hours duration. Fix it please!
1293025728204689408 2020-08-10 23:25:31 EDT <MattRyderTV> Having @Xfinity in the PNW basically means your internet will have outages daily. You‚Äôve been warned!
1293024622401785856 2020-08-10 23:21:07 EDT <DennisCMcMahon> Xfinity Internet outage in N. Burlington VT over 11 hours duration. Unconscionable service interruption which demands an official response.
1293018537267732480 2020-08-10 22:56:57 EDT <cjbydesign> @Xfinity has had an internet outage all day in my area! During a team people are working from home! This is ridiculous!
1293014559868047360 2020-08-10 22:41:08 EDT <Chickapoo88> What‚Äôs with the @Xfinity outages.  Looks like it has hit many big cities.
1293008008197308417 2020-08-10 22:15:06 EDT <obvious_shirts> Any other Chicagoans experiencing an Xfinity outage? Third time this month.
1293007648682631171 2020-08-10 22:13:41 EDT <kellydugs272727> @Xfinity Hi, I buy a prepaid monthly internet pass for $54.95 to use on my MacBook Air and I‚Äôve been having great difficulty with the connection all night tonight. Is this a widespread outage?
1293005953944649730 2020-08-10 22:06:56 EDT <Sabrie1717> @Xfinity @comcastcares we have been without WiFi for over 6 days now! No updates, only there's an outage in your area. Working from home is impossible without WiFi!
1293001419809841158 2020-08-10 21:48:55 EDT <JBartlCI> Would love to participate in these sports Twitter conversations but my ‚Äúarea‚Äù is experiencing its third prolonged @Xfinity TV/Internet outage in the last 9 days after already crediting me $50 because of previous prolonged outages in my ‚Äúarea.‚Äù What can you offer me @Uverse?
1293000106296463360 2020-08-10 21:43:42 EDT <urbanmadlibz> first the damn lights kept going out now xfinity got a fucking outage until FOUR IN THE MORNING
1292999078515814400 2020-08-10 21:39:37 EDT <iSoPluggedIn> They talkin bout it's a outage right now
1292997949908189184 2020-08-10 21:35:08 EDT <iSoPluggedIn> How many people are affected by this "outage" that @Xfinity is having? #Xfinity #XfinitySucks
1292997909059952640 2020-08-10 21:34:58 EDT <Xfinity> Hey. You can always check the Xfinity My Account app to see if you're affected by an area outage -- if so, updates will be provided there as they are available as well.
1292997213120077827 2020-08-10 21:32:12 EDT <iSoPluggedIn> Will be switching services in the morning because @Xfinity got me F'd up. I'm eating with no TV because of some outage and it wont be fixed for 3 got damn hours.
1292996914217181184 2020-08-10 21:31:01 EDT <iSoPluggedIn> Then we can't even speak to the agent so we can be told if we are affected by the outage because your customer service is horrible. In a country where everyone is working from home why cant I speak to a agent at 9pm eastern time? @Xfinity
1292995202978906112 2020-08-10 21:24:13 EDT <Alwayson_point> Wtf is this outage shit xfinity talking bout ?
1292982756906012674 2020-08-10 20:34:46 EDT <Xfinity> Hi! If you're in an outage, keep an eye on your My Account app -- it will be updated with more info as it's available.
1292981890379665411 2020-08-10 20:31:19 EDT <MarkCabrales9> I was looking forward to playing some warzone but there‚Äôs an @Xfinity outage  pic.twitter.com/2OlCqJRl8p
1292974542990827523 2020-08-10 20:02:08 EDT <szpeTech> @Xfinity @comcast we have outage again after 7 days outage. Bethel, CT 06801. Very difficult to work from home with un reliable internet service.
1292973831968169985 2020-08-10 19:59:18 EDT <szpeTech> #xfinityoutage #xfinity we have outages again at zip code 06801 Hillside Ct
1292970376511795201 2020-08-10 19:45:34 EDT <zia_kat> @comcastcares @comcast @xfinity i've spent over 2 hours trying to report an outage and downed power pole/line. i've lost track of how many times i've been hung up on by your automated system, disconnected from phone & chat cs. how do i get an appointment to get service restored?
1292970189076799490 2020-08-10 19:44:49 EDT <RomanAsturiasKr> Yes it is an outage, received a report earlier
1292969690856402945 2020-08-10 19:42:51 EDT <CBCook2> Our service had been out for 6 days. No power outage just tv internet and phone. You must be kidding me- supporting work ffom home. No help from customer service- nothing but lies.
1292969675324891143 2020-08-10 19:42:47 EDT <MadalynArmijo6> @Xfinity my internet is down and your outage map, chat function and scheduled callbacks don‚Äôt work. Is your company even alive??
1292969310189690880 2020-08-10 19:41:20 EDT <Xfinity> Hi. Have you checked your My Account app to see if there is an outage in your area?
1292960018002849794 2020-08-10 19:04:24 EDT <Xfinity> Sorry for the downtime, Ben. Does the My Account app list an area outage?
1292957890345566210 2020-08-10 18:55:57 EDT <KumarSandeep321> @Xfinity Any estimates when the xfinity outage will be over in Ridgebury neighborhood ? Thanks
1292950714541461505 2020-08-10 18:27:26 EDT <rybalkin550> @comcastcares @comcast @Xfinity this is completely and utterly ridiculous all affected customers by the outage should be reimbursed a courtesy Bill credit of at least $50 because people have to go to school and do online school work and go to work and none of that can be done üò°
1292950455413280773 2020-08-10 18:26:25 EDT <DennisCMcMahon> Outrageous long time Xfinity Internet power outage in N. Burlington still going on after 5 hours duration!
1292942806684700690 2020-08-10 17:56:01 EDT <elson_rob> @Xfinity apparently listened and gave me day two of Internet outages, which are still ongoing. But now they‚Äôre cutting into ü¶à ü¶à ü¶à watching time and that‚Äôs üêé üí©  https://twitter.com/elson_rob/status/1292603300433592321¬†‚Ä¶
1292939662885978114 2020-08-10 17:43:31 EDT <EPiQ_cR> So when there‚Äôs a neighborhood outage, you auto-refund involved users 1/30th of their bill, right @Xfinity?  Sincerely, Someone struggling to work from home right now.
1292939388935122945 2020-08-10 17:42:26 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Julie! Does your app indicate that there's an outage in your area?
1292938500342333440 2020-08-10 17:38:54 EDT <Len63700784> @comcastcares Contacted customer service regarding refund over an outage. Have txts from xfinity stating outage occurred. Customer service is saying there was no outage. HELP!!!
1292935975241474050 2020-08-10 17:28:52 EDT <Stein2Stein> Wish this were true, but I haven‚Äôt had service in 4 days!  An area outage keeps recurring during business hours.  No service for work or school, and no customer service or live person to talk to.
1292935629668589568 2020-08-10 17:27:30 EDT <khaleessiiiiii> @Xfinity Your outage map still shows area outage! Wires are downed and snapped in half.  Please help!  pic.twitter.com/ronXpVafWT
1292934395997884423 2020-08-10 17:22:36 EDT <mikefaley> ok thank you so the answer is "no" then you can't tell me if abq has outages at the moment. unrelated question do you happen to have a suggestion box for your social media strategy

1292933388127612953 2020-08-10 17:18:35 EDT <Xfinity> Hi! You can check your My Account app for info on any outages in your area.
1292932234815713280 2020-08-10 17:14:00 EDT <Xfinity> Oh no! Does the My Account app show an area outage?
1292931091159027714 2020-08-10 17:09:28 EDT <JoeyFyd6485> @Xfinity I pay WAY to much money to have outages happen as frequently as they do. 6 in the last 3 weeks. Not a cloud in the sky today and we have another outage. My wife and I have lost out on work and money, yet you will still demand your bill paid next month......
1292924571188895744 2020-08-10 16:43:33 EDT <scoootty13> Anybody else dealing with this xfinity internet outage ????
1292912361062518784 2020-08-10 15:55:02 EDT <Xfinity> Hey. We can help out. Does the My Account app list an area outage?
1292911784555417600 2020-08-10 15:52:45 EDT <mikefaley> @Xfinity hey. hope you're having a good day so far. can you please tell me if ABQ is having any outages at the moment?
1292909945730498561 2020-08-10 15:45:26 EDT <comcast> Hi. If you're still experiencing an outage after last week's storms, the Xfinity My Account app will have info and updates as they are available.
1292904978059800577 2020-08-10 15:25:42 EDT <ADerkowitz> xfinity is absolute trash. been without internet since 1PM and its 3:30PM. time to get a different internet service provider because outages like these arent going to cut it now a days
1292904515432140800 2020-08-10 15:23:52 EDT <enby_bunny> K so, no stream today cuuuz there‚Äôs an Xfinity outage in my area sooooo that‚Äôs cool üôÉ  https://twitter.com/enby_bunny/status/1292727395640778752¬†‚Ä¶
1292898005654405120 2020-08-10 14:58:00 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Camille! If you had an extended outage, there may be residual issues affecting your service today. Have you checked your My Account app to see if there are any alerts?
1292893580332335104 2020-08-10 14:40:25 EDT <Xfinity> What's up? Are you in an area outage?
1292889414780280839 2020-08-10 14:23:51 EDT <becasarella> @Xfinity need human assistance. There‚Äôs an outage in 06877 for a week now. Please help.
1292887454446477313 2020-08-10 14:16:04 EDT <Pixxydoodle> They said 5 for mine. But as a disabled person who's only entertainment is streaming, this stinks. They did however credit me $5 on just my internet. If you haven't gotten a credit I suggest calling & when they ask if its technical support or outage related keep saying  AGENT.
1292884950690209797 2020-08-10 14:06:07 EDT <flowersineden> @Xfinity what is the deal?! You know we‚Äôre working from home. I have two projects due this afternoon and a WiFi outage preventing me from completing them.
1292873318996074501 2020-08-10 13:19:54 EDT <Swr377> @Xfinity Outage for a few of us in our neighborhood. Told is was our equipment. Cannot be possible that all of us had a problem at 4:45 am this morning with our equipment. There IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOUR SERVICE!!!!
1292871119905730561 2020-08-10 13:11:10 EDT <1scottasmith> @xfinity 35 mins on hold then got disconnected by your system .  Two weeks - 2 hours of my time wasted on six different outages.  How much more should I take ????
1292866179636199425 2020-08-10 12:51:32 EDT <lalindahair> @Xfinity  I have 2 kids online learning... internet outage. Now what?!
1292865564805935105 2020-08-10 12:49:05 EDT <Spyro_PD> @Xfinity outage number 9 in 4 days. This is horrible. I will be switching companies ASAP.
1292858741327527940 2020-08-10 12:21:58 EDT <psychokitty78> Here is the transformer that sat in the road for three days. You have had people, frontier has been here, xfinity, Eversource trucks. Your workers have been spoken to.  You have us having power outage since 8-6 at 111pm. Wrong been since 8-4 at 245pm. Figure this out  pic.twitter.com/QbWnCRQbbe
1292856299160567808 2020-08-10 12:12:16 EDT <HahnNoah> @RCNconnects service outage has left my business without internet or phones for three days now. No one has reached out to us with an explanation or timetable for repair. Why are you okay with allowing this to go on? #rcn #OutageUpdate #noservice #WashingtonDC @Xfinity @Verizon
1292853994914799618 2020-08-10 12:03:07 EDT <Sir_Iyke_> Look.. I‚Äôm damn tired of all these damn outages @Xfinity .. always during peak hours at work
1292846235360133122 2020-08-10 11:32:17 EDT <aricroush> @comcastcares @comcast @Xfinity    I didn't think it was possible to get worse.. but in the past 37 hours that I have been monitoring; I have gone down 222 times (an outage is defined as loss of connectivity for greater than 5 seconds)
1292845099660062725 2020-08-10 11:27:46 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Dan. Is this an area outage that's being reported through the My Account app or is your personal internet down?
1292844890708156416 2020-08-10 11:26:56 EDT <beachwood> Am feeling so disrespected by @Xfinity who after six days of outage can only tell me that they are ‚Äúevaluating‚Äù my outage when we know perfectly well that they know when they are going to get to replace the downed wire #frustrated #xfinityoutage #arrogantxfinity
1292840542406160386 2020-08-10 11:09:39 EDT <whatisthis94> Yea this outage is bullshit sorry you missed the games

1292702648299335680 2020-08-10 02:01:43 EDT <Bill_Flood> Um, no @Xfinity, why don't YOU check that YOUR cables are tightly secured?  FIVE DAYS of never knowing when the next outage will hit? This one has now lasted SEVEN hours.  pic.twitter.com/V5pFKzfyfS
1292698330464768002 2020-08-10 01:44:33 EDT <speedquest2> It's Xfinity, the second I could get away from them I did. Think they're going to refund you your outage days and lost productivity? That's the only thing that would make it right.

1292611867614023682 2020-08-09 20:00:59 EDT <stateofgary> @Xfinity @comcastcares I signed up for txt message updates on storm outage - never received anything other than "Xfinity confirmed an outage in your area that we're working to resolve by 11:05 PM. We'll text you when it's fixed. Details:  http://xfinity.com/status¬† TxtHelpOrStop"
1292607071138074624 2020-08-09 19:41:55 EDT <A_Fonzie> Girl it was like an outage in my area and surrounding neighborhoods randomly smh glad its back lol
1292603300433592321 2020-08-09 19:26:56 EDT <elson_rob> 3rd @Xfinity Internet outage of the day. So no PGA Championship. No ü¶à ü¶à ü¶à  FFS, have your outages during the week so I have an excuse to not work, not on a day like today üò°  pic.twitter.com/Vma0I90yX0

1292595912242597890 2020-08-09 18:57:35 EDT <nickpiccone> Very cool @Xfinity restored my service just in time to see the Phillies bullpen do its thing and Joel Embiid get hurt absolutely love to see it   Should‚Äôve planned the outage for today imo  https://twitter.com/nickpiccone/status/1292294816433352707¬†‚Ä¶
1292592655105495041 2020-08-09 18:44:38 EDT <BigSyracuse> @comcastcares is there a reason my xfinity WiFi disconnects at least once a day when I‚Äôm playing games, or an outage in the area constantly? It‚Äôs so very frustrating
1292588708080820225 2020-08-09 18:28:57 EDT <wafflesandjosie> AT@T fiber if in you area. Very rarely have outages. We ditched Comcast years ago and best decision.
1292571724521910272 2020-08-09 17:21:28 EDT <innayewhy_> All I know is xfinity better fix this lil outage or whatever by the time I get back from the store
1292562475947360257 2020-08-09 16:44:43 EDT <kkhaRN> @Xfinity thanks for the 2 day outage, esctatic to be missing golf‚Äôs first major. 4 days without electricity clearly wasn‚Äôt enough fun. #bebetter
1292558699324727297 2020-08-09 16:29:43 EDT <innayewhy_> I thought xfinity was the best WiFi/cable provider? They forever having outages and shit
1292552893145513986 2020-08-09 16:06:38 EDT <MandaJaneCooper> Currently have AT&T and going through an outage that's projected to last until tomorrow üôÉ
1292515947643842560 2020-08-09 13:39:50 EDT <RealKevtro> @Xfinity WiFi down in Decatur IL was working 2-3 hours ago and no outage report??
1292501016160530432 2020-08-09 12:40:30 EDT <sedanny323> I‚Äôm honestly about to make the switch to at&t internet bc these @Xfinity outages are ridiculous. @comcastcares fix your stuff before you lose a customer
1292492173913587712 2020-08-09 12:05:22 EDT <xxMarsxz> I‚Äôve had an Internet outage for the past 4 days  pic.twitter.com/tZYtgij2OS

1292457210778460160 2020-08-09 09:46:26 EDT <Salamivibes> It's honestly really upsetting, I've only experienced complications like this with Xfinity unfortunately, and of all times now is not the time for them to be having these outages..
1292423751611682817 2020-08-09 07:33:29 EDT <stairway2_seven> @xfinity this outage is still going on wtf? Its really taking 24+ hours? What a joke.
1292406601375252480 2020-08-09 06:25:20 EDT <knaimoli> @Xfinity going on 24 hours of no internet or cable and no update on your app of this major outage.
1292399009139752960 2020-08-09 05:55:10 EDT <TIAMOMMA> @comcastcares @Xfinity #comcastoutage Hey Comcast you MUST know by now what exactly is the cause for the outage so why can‚Äôt you give an update to you customers?!?!  This lack of communication is a BIG issue.  More like #comcastoutrage
1292314889529237504 2020-08-09 00:20:54 EDT <brownbaddieSB> I‚Äôm using up all my hotspot since xfinity outage is still going on. I‚Äôm really annoyed.
1292311073467629575 2020-08-09 00:05:44 EDT <reddboneash218> @Xfinity is there any update on the outage?
1292300325630746629 2020-08-08 23:23:02 EDT <YungangXu> The @Xfinity Internet outage started early morning for a whole day. There's no plan of recovery yet. Never experienced such a long outu before. Practicing #CleanNetwork in advanceüòÇ pic.twitter.com/45VzHTZ5ID
1292294816433352707 2020-08-08 23:01:08 EDT <nickpiccone> Love to have a random @xfinity outage for 12+ hours and counting when I have the worst cell service at home on a day where the Phillies and Flyers have great wins I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT GIVE ME MORE OUTAGES
1292270393819041795 2020-08-08 21:24:05 EDT <pretty_youngkay> I‚Äôm gone need a credit for this outage @Xfinity
1292269605096914947 2020-08-08 21:20:57 EDT <nicholascodes> I just switched to xfinity and it‚Äôs better imo. But not at the moment with this outage they got going on....I never had an outage with fios.
1292268010498031616 2020-08-08 21:14:37 EDT <lifebygwendolyn> Xfinity really up your game. Internet has been out since 7 and has been spotty all week to the point where I could no longer work from home due to a lack of service. If there are expected outages or line-work inform your users and don‚Äôt just leave us without access
1292267024320729090 2020-08-08 21:10:42 EDT <Heri_Moja> So Xfinity is trying to tell me that the past 9 hours haven‚Äôt been enough to fix an outage issue???? I need my WiFi!
1292266871434117122 2020-08-08 21:10:05 EDT <brownbaddieSB> Xfinity had all yesterday to have a power outage while i was clocked in at work but they decided to have that shit today & it‚Äôs been all day üôÑ
1292261806979919872 2020-08-08 20:49:58 EDT <NyjahBiello> That page has loads of outagesüò©holy moly lol thanks!!!
1292259986630938631 2020-08-08 20:42:44 EDT <CryptoKobe> @Xfinity how many outages are we going to have?  This is the third one in a month.  Glad you guys have a monopoly so you can continue to provide a shitty service with no fear of being replaced. @SenateFloor
1292255311940771841 2020-08-08 20:24:09 EDT <TomGimpel> @comcastcares @comcast @Xfinity complete outage - no phone, cable or internet and I can‚Äôt get an appointment for 5 days? Ridiculous! Why am I paying for this again? Please DM me!!
1292251311921147905 2020-08-08 20:08:16 EDT <realMetheusela> @Hiko did getting a business line with xfinity ever solve your issue? I‚Äôm now experiencing very frequent outages and my internet is rarely stable enough to stream now.
1292251090419941385 2020-08-08 20:07:23 EDT <ReidRavin> Well the only ISP, @Xfinity ,  is out in most of Wilmington DE. Wonder if @JoeBiden wants to play ping-pong ? #outage  pic.twitter.com/wQhFEsYvxt
1292249526036832257 2020-08-08 20:01:10 EDT <staugmagicalme> Hi #xfinity Apparently there is no way to express my dismay about the poor service that you provide via  other modems. 5 outages in <2 weeks in NW St Augustine Fl.  What‚Äôs up?
1292247252434587648 2020-08-08 19:52:08 EDT <CitizensVoice> An Xfinity On Demand outage reported Saturday in the area appears to be affecting customers in Lackawanna and Luzerne counties.  https://www.citizensvoice.com/news/outage-affects-xfinity-on-demand-customers-in-area/article_b2078fc1-42e0-538b-8e56-759db5ed58d9.html#utm_campaign=blox&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social¬†‚Ä¶

1292245607038554115 2020-08-08 19:45:36 EDT <mhaney1017> @NBCConnecticut ‚Äîall this talk about Eversource‚Äôs response, no one is mentioning that Xfinity hasn‚Äôt restored service nor have they been seen anywhere. My power is restored but my cable/internet is not-I feel like they shut it off during power outage. #fixmycable !!
1292235497260097540 2020-08-08 19:05:25 EDT <JFrieberg> @Xfinity 7hr outage of all service so far...no time table for return...my  2yrs is up next month, say goodbye to this happy horseshit!
1292233133236948993 2020-08-08 18:56:02 EDT <gdwade73> It‚Äôs funny. I hear so many complaints about Xfinity. I guess I have been lucky. 4 or 5 locations in 20 years with solid speed with almost no outages. My father in law hs has nothing but garbage service from ATT. YMMV
1292227647267897345 2020-08-08 18:34:14 EDT <LadyNichet> Are you guys kidding right now????? People WORK FROM HOME!!!!!! WTF are you doing about this multistate outage????????
1292216715544272899 2020-08-08 17:50:47 EDT <thatguy606> @comcastcares when is the internet outage eta to be fixed 19036 !! 6 hrs and not even an update @Xfinity @comcast at least give us some information
1292208111198109696 2020-08-08 17:16:36 EDT <LilPeeJay_> Xfinity so shit... how tf they got a outage everywhere and got mfs racing & shit ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1292203481458188289 2020-08-08 16:58:12 EDT <exact__lee> Xfinity is on all nut shit today!  it‚Äôs been like 9 hrs- why is this outage not resolved!? @Xfinity üòí
1292200524792631297 2020-08-08 16:46:27 EDT <Babypinkgamer> Chatted with an xfinity agent and asked about the outage.. chat started ‚Äúreconnecting‚Äù and when I tried connecting to another agent it said none available. This outage is getting ridiculous!
1292199454427222019 2020-08-08 16:42:12 EDT <brownbaddieSB> Xfinity need to fix this outage!!
1292190089934708738 2020-08-08 16:04:59 EDT <sunny_n_sandy> TV & internet outages AGAIN @Xfinity what is the problem?!?
1292188225101017089 2020-08-08 15:57:35 EDT <netty_nells> Woow @Xfinity is ruining my weekend with there outages ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüò≠ like everything in 2020 need WiFi
1292185292179374082 2020-08-08 15:45:55 EDT <RainieBunz> I still have no internet. But i saw someone on Reddit having the same issue as me. So i have to wait until Monday for an outage to promptly reported by a technician. @Xfinity sucks. I can't wait to never use them again.
1292182584194207746 2020-08-08 15:35:10 EDT <JlukeJohn> I wish I could see the Xfinity race, but at least they bought Xfinity more time to repair the outage.
1292178700298002433 2020-08-08 15:19:44 EDT <pgcraiig> when xfinity fix the outage imma download it back
1292174818775896064 2020-08-08 15:04:18 EDT <Spectrum_Philly> And I have no TV/internet! Major outage @Xfinity
1292174234475798530 2020-08-08 15:01:59 EDT <JlukeJohn> The cup race is in one hour. And there's a local Xfinity outage.   WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY?
1292173581493952520 2020-08-08 14:59:23 EDT <SavzCarter> @Xfinity is the freaking WORST. Way too many hidden fees, NO communication, ALWAYS outages, and sketchy AF.
1292164693696512000 2020-08-08 14:24:04 EDT <WrldCtz3n> Yet again @Xfinity customer service is atrocious. Help desk pointless (1.5 hrs)... Next send Tech also pointless as I told them what the problem is and is not. The "planned" maintenence turned into an area unplanned outage (cough someone f'd the fiber or the config).
1292154236474667008 2020-08-08 13:42:31 EDT <nelizadrew> I'm starting to think @Xfinity's latest outage fried my modem. They claim service is back, but no amount of restarting is making internet happen at my house. God I hate them so.
1292154142144761863 2020-08-08 13:42:09 EDT <JlukeJohn> Well, it's a local Xfinity outage, so that explains why my box and internet doesn't work. However, I hooked up my tv antenna and I get live Formula E. Total W!
1292153839739707392 2020-08-08 13:40:57 EDT <mommigunn> annddddsd xfinity is down bcuz of an outage around here
1292151476689743873 2020-08-08 13:31:33 EDT <Babypinkgamer> Thanks to xfinity having an outage I had to go into our germ infested office for the day üò∑
1292146891547987969 2020-08-08 13:13:20 EDT <_JuiceJones> Um @Xfinity is there an outage in my area or something?
1292142410257125379 2020-08-08 12:55:32 EDT <mikalelizabethh> I would like to update and say that we have had 3 internet outages this week and IM OVER IT. Xfinity needs to get it together üò§
1292134623703638018 2020-08-08 12:24:35 EDT <GingiesMom> Same thing happened to me when I was WFH They gave me a tracker for the next outage. üôÑ No credit, no solution of any kind
1292132999774044171 2020-08-08 12:18:08 EDT <Tez1255> Fuck @Xfinity and @comcastcares. Internet has been off/on for a week and a half and ‚Äúoutages‚Äù the last 3 days. You call and only get automated responses.  You want to actually speak with a person Lol?... you have to wait 2+ hours.  Kids need stable internet for virtual school.
1292126248987242496 2020-08-08 11:51:18 EDT <netty_nells> Wow I woke up and xfinity has been on some bullshit how tf you have a WiFi outage
1292101408167211009 2020-08-08 10:12:36 EDT <MsRubikcube> @Xfinity @comcastcares someone needs to contact me ASAP regarding your internet and tv outages. It‚Äôs been 4 days of this and I work from home. Who will compensate me for the days I‚Äôve been unable to work
1292100369401643013 2020-08-08 10:08:28 EDT <MsRubikcube> Listen @Xfinity someone needs to contact me ASAP! 4 days with internet outages is unacceptable when I work from home like thousands of others. You are unreliable
1292092843046113285 2020-08-08 09:38:34 EDT <dwightyoakamfan> I feel your pain. I switched to @Xfinity a few months ago to save $. I‚Äôve already had several frustrating outages. Never happened when I had @ATT. You get what you pay for I guess.
1292076896876924933 2020-08-08 08:35:12 EDT <danic_98> They told me it would be this past Thursday night then Friday night then this coming Tuesday but I logged into my Alexa yesterday afternoon and it was online. Outage map still says I have no power. I did get a $15 credit on my xfinity bill tho.
1292068806530084864 2020-08-08 08:03:03 EDT <laura0108NJ> Hey @Comcast @Xfinity  I‚Äôve been without cable/internet for over 12 hours now. Your website tells me the outage map isn‚Äôt available, convienient. Did you furlough all the service crews? I pay alot of money every month! C‚Äômon already!
1291946507021713408 2020-08-07 23:57:05 EDT <ChrisHend83> That‚Äôs considered a scam because an isp didn‚Äôt update the app yet? They report it based off percent reported or a node reports down. It could literally bring 1 block and unless that block all report it, it won‚Äôt show as an outage. Taps don‚Äôt have the ability to report low levels.
1291933628818128901 2020-08-07 23:05:54 EDT <vtorialynn> Way to many outages in the last 2 weeks, can never speak to anyone on the phone!! There's no way they are working 24/7 to fix anything! üò† #NeedNewProvider
1291932402525274113 2020-08-07 23:01:02 EDT <vtorialynn> @Xfinity I've had your services for a long time and lately it seems your services are experiencing outages way to often & I can never speak to an agent! Looks like I'll need to find a new providerüôÑ
1291930449049198592 2020-08-07 22:53:16 EDT <Brandin34698762> @Xfinity do I get a statement credit even if I don't call about the outage  pic.twitter.com/szCtaorErU

1291910474594791425 2020-08-07 21:33:54 EDT <HemiXXVI> So the Xfinity wanna have a outage the day I have to watch Love After Lockup üôÑ
1291906667735638016 2020-08-07 21:18:46 EDT <lgugert> @xfinity How about some communication on this outage?  Distraught in Putnam County NY. People have to work from home. This is ridiculous!  Looking forward to our credit.
1291902238462443520 2020-08-07 21:01:10 EDT <Iizwarren> Okay if our internet isn‚Äôt working properly by tomorrow we‚Äôre switching to AT&T @xfinity. It‚Äôs has been out from 10 am-10 pm since Tuesday despite NO outages being reported in our area. In the middle of a pandemic when 2 out of 3 ppl in our house are working from home
1291890270594899973 2020-08-07 20:13:37 EDT <smileydesignpho> @comcastcares xfinity just did some kind of scheduled outage and took the weekend off. Off until 11/9 at 11:59 PM wtf?
1291888662913982466 2020-08-07 20:07:14 EDT <JonathanLOdom> Waiting to see if this @Xfinity outage gets resolved quickly so I can stream tonight. This doesn't help me with my Stream Schedule #Twitch #TwitchTV
1291884426130083840 2020-08-07 19:50:23 EDT <Xfinity> Hi there! Our first suggestion would be to check the Xfinity My Account app. You'll be able to access outage information and troubleshooting help.
1291881764118499330 2020-08-07 19:39:49 EDT <B_hazeeeee> Xfinity outage üôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑ
1291878418980777984 2020-08-07 19:26:31 EDT <Kythasx> Looks like there is an xfinity outage in my area and it probably won‚Äôt be back up until after I need to be asleep. Getting up at 5am to go fishing tomorrow.
1291873608151601152 2020-08-07 19:07:24 EDT <Roadrunner_1919> This was an outage, according to the xfinity website, that lasted three hours. The one last Friday lasted nine hours.   We‚Äôre mostly on laptops, so we‚Äôre not hardwired.
1291873164893605889 2020-08-07 19:05:39 EDT <Erianna_mom> @Xfinity what is going on with the outages?

1291861463057956864 2020-08-07 18:19:09 EDT <alber101467> There are no outages reported at this time on the app!!
1291861371064389635 2020-08-07 18:18:47 EDT <Infinite_Cocoa> I cannot believe there has been an @Xfinity outage for more than 5+ hours....this is ridiculous
1291859373103423488 2020-08-07 18:10:50 EDT <alber101467> @Xfinity is there any outage or issue of speed with the service at Meridiana at Iowa Colony!! Internet has being very slow during the entire week!!!
1291858479112687617 2020-08-07 18:07:17 EDT <TheHRLife> @Xfinity S Fulton experiences constant outages keeping residents offline 4 hrs 2 days at a x. It‚Äôs difficult being in a pandemic, hving 0 service 4 extended periods exacerbates the problem. When will service b restored?And I really wud appreciate an explanation #xfinityoutage
1291849911521222659 2020-08-07 17:33:14 EDT <Xfinity> Have they checked the Xfinity My Account app? That's where the most updated outage information will be. We have techs out working diligently to get services back up and running. How long have they been without service?
1291849363434610688 2020-08-07 17:31:04 EDT <Haladmer> @Xfinity Okay, I get it, you're probably swamped with people upset about ongoing outages, but can we get someone there to make a public statement about issue(s)?  Phone support doesn't answer, and the "bots" just say to sign in to your account to check status. Not helpful
1291846762152566785 2020-08-07 17:20:44 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Christi. You can check the Xfinity My Account app for the most updated outage information.
1291846462591049731 2020-08-07 17:19:32 EDT <Remixie> I‚Äôm here more than 3 days without @Xfinity internet in New Haven, CT because of a huge outage. I would jump immediately to Frontier but they don‚Äôt have enough download speed in my area. I need at least 300 down and 70 up. @GoNetspeed please come to New Haven Annex ASAP!
1291841485843976204 2020-08-07 16:59:46 EDT <heath_cldheath> @comcastcares, the power outage in Western MA from the recent tropical storm has been fixed. Is it really going to be *two more days* before Xfinity cable and internet is back?
1291839690178519042 2020-08-07 16:52:38 EDT <jakesterx53> @comcastcares We've had an outage in our area for going on 5 days now, can we at least get a reason please? @Xfinity
1291836304448249862 2020-08-07 16:39:10 EDT <prontogian> this @Xfinity outage is terrible
1291829074369949702 2020-08-07 16:10:27 EDT <blaquewitha_q> Xfinity got the nerve to have an outage rn like my daughter won‚Äôt burn this bitch to the ground if she can‚Äôt watch Mickey before her nap
1291820691592040448 2020-08-07 15:37:08 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Carlo. You can check the Xfinity My Account app for the most updated outage information.
1291809737776996354 2020-08-07 14:53:36 EDT <roezmahree> Been having intermittent @Xfinity outages for the past three weeks. Today, it's going out for several minutes every hour or so. Was on live chat with support when it went down again. üòÇ May have to just switch back to AT&T.
1291803896038346752 2020-08-07 14:30:24 EDT <bollinger> How can schools provide choices to students to stay home for education with regular outages from @comcast?  We are now looking at impact to children's education with the caviler attitude of @Xfinity?   #ChildrensLivesMatter
1291800379252908032 2020-08-07 14:16:25 EDT <bollinger> Now I am on a rant.  Why does @Xfinity @comcast have a monopoly?  Intermittent outages are now predicable.   Not only does #comcastsuck they should be reviewed by regulators.
1291797573632753667 2020-08-07 14:05:16 EDT <ryandybala> @Xfinity what's the deal with the outage today? No internet or TV... #xfinityoutage
1291796482434138122 2020-08-07 14:00:56 EDT <Xfinity> You can check the Xfinity My Account app for the most updated outage information.
1291796224341946368 2020-08-07 13:59:54 EDT <krpurtell> @Xfinity another Friday,  another outage @ 60630.
1291789820705026049 2020-08-07 13:34:28 EDT <cmd_bag> Funny how ever since i switched to @xfinity after moving, ive had more internet outages in 6 months than @EnhancedTelecom  has had in 3 years.
1291789643860578305 2020-08-07 13:33:46 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Peter. You can check the Xfinity My Account app to see if there is an outage effecting your area. Feel free to DM us here on Twitter:  http://xfin.tv/support¬† so we can check into this further for you.
1291788853540532231 2020-08-07 13:30:37 EDT <doraibasan> xfinity would have an outage as I'm trying to set up my computer smh
1291785592192274435 2020-08-07 13:17:40 EDT <Ginger624> There is ZIP in that app. All it says is ‚Äúthere‚Äôs an outage‚Äù  Your service sucks.
1291780901374840832 2020-08-07 12:59:01 EDT <sashapave> We switched from Xfinity 1g to AT&T 1g. So much better. Our Xfinity node was overloaded with outages every week. Wish we had more choices but that‚Äôs another issue. Yes you need physical install but I had a basement ingress so nobody came inside.
1291779178027798532 2020-08-07 12:52:10 EDT <staylor2987> Every single person who called or chatted was told no outage. One person was told they would only report an outage if 9+ people reported it.
1291778674035957763 2020-08-07 12:50:10 EDT <1realady> See I don't get on this thing that much! But umm Comcast /Xfinity is with the foolery! Who has outages everyday during the work day! Those outages need to happen in the overnight hours not in the middle of the day! Then you have no reps to talk too Tom Foolery!
1291776834359754757 2020-08-07 12:42:52 EDT <unstoppable_kim> Roommate said she didn‚Äôt notice any outages. But this has been happening almost everyday sense we got it this week. Always sometime around 1145 it just starts going in and out (normally takes like 5-7 minutes for it to come back) and then it‚Äôs fine again after 230.
1291770219355148290 2020-08-07 12:16:34 EDT <Xfinity> Our teams are working hard to restore services in your area. You can stay up to date with the status of your services with the My Account app. You should see a time of completion for the outage you're in.
1291769051635646466 2020-08-07 12:11:56 EDT <trebecca07> yes it says there‚Äôs an outage, but we literally got our power back so when‚Äôs the cable coming?
1291767242225381376 2020-08-07 12:04:45 EDT <___shanie> brehhh wassup with y‚Äôall and these outages @Xfinity DAMN!!!!!
1291766947479277574 2020-08-07 12:03:34 EDT <_Nia23_> There‚Äôs an outage üòí
1291766666116947973 2020-08-07 12:02:27 EDT <Call_me_Miles> @comcastcares @Xfinity I understand there are reimbursements for outages. However, I start an extremely important career course on Monday. Is there a hopspot option that I can pick up and a retail location, or is it possible to be reimbursed for purchasing supplemental 1/2
1291765963302621186 2020-08-07 11:59:40 EDT <CisforCarla> Welp. Look at this bogus bogusness. It's not like we need internet to work from home or anything.  Thanks for NOT giving notice of an entire day's outage, @Xfinity.üôÉ  And some of y'all outchea discussing grading kids based on whether or not they log in to your class on time.üòíüòí  pic.twitter.com/yvlgYy6PXs
1291763498314338314 2020-08-07 11:49:52 EDT <twowaymirrors> @Xfinity Is there a way to get credited for an extended power outage? We‚Äôve been out since midday Tuesday so haven‚Äôt been able to use any services for a couple of days now.
1291760887586406400 2020-08-07 11:39:30 EDT <SoriaSports23> This is all I wanted to do on my day off!! But NOOOOO @Xfinity had to have an ‚Äúoutage‚Äù you Guys better give me some form of discount on the next bill because this is bull!! #UCLIsBack #NVM #XFINITY  pic.twitter.com/wgeNXwpd8x
1291755436635455488 2020-08-07 11:17:50 EDT <carlos2012us> This people are expensive and take all their time when an outage happens, right now they have been for almost 24 hours in Hialeah area and problem still the same, every 2 hours they move the resolution time 2 more hours. Shame for you Xfinity Comcast
1291754729278771200 2020-08-07 11:15:01 EDT <Xfinity> We apologize for the outage, Pat. We can help with your bill due to this. Send us a DM here:  https://xfin.tv/support¬† üëà
1291748209099001857 2020-08-07 10:49:07 EDT <pjmccann3> .@Xfinity August 9th?!?!!? This 6 day outage be reflected in a lower bill ...right?  pic.twitter.com/qAyXKnSnLg
1291747634445717505 2020-08-07 10:46:50 EDT <cityunderthesun> Today is not the day to have an outage @Xfinity @comcast
1291742822899625984 2020-08-07 10:27:43 EDT <ITechGeek> @Xfinity Two things, A)  What did your representative ask me to check the power cord after asking me to check the power light?  B)  About half way through the 30 minute call I asked if the outage listed near me on the outage map might be affecting me w/ no answer just to be...
1291736195718881280 2020-08-07 10:01:23 EDT <BrwnEyedSmurf81> Thank you. I got confirmation from an agent the outage is storm related.
1291736031277068288 2020-08-07 10:00:43 EDT <LeeAnn68161728> Comcast will refund and possibly give you an extra credit. They have for me in the past. Once I was out for a few hours and got a $60 credit. Not even an outage on the grid. Call them.
1291734360379527169 2020-08-07 09:54:05 EDT <mcnelliswrites> Someone I know called your company and XFinity didn‚Äôt even know there was an outage, even though the app said the company was aware of it, so you will have to forgive customers if we don‚Äôt trust the app/website.
1291734257166168066 2020-08-07 09:53:40 EDT <briaszy01> How the fuck do I have power, and had WiFi all last night but wake up and now @Xfinity is back down? before you even ask YES I checked the app. There‚Äôs an outage. But there has been for FOUR DAYS. We have no ETA for restored service. Are you planning to reimburse for this shit?
1291733991800934400 2020-08-07 09:52:37 EDT <Adiofreak> I reported an outage because nobody around me has internet and @comcastcares @Xfinity have yet to update it on the app or via text, how are we in 2020 and still letting isp companies scam their customers?
1291728976004689921 2020-08-07 09:32:41 EDT <Xfinity> Hi there and sorry for the trouble this outage may be causing you. Our crews are working to restore services in your area as quickly as possible. But you can use the Xfinity My Account App or  http://xfin.tv/status¬† to stay up to date with your services.
1291727654094278657 2020-08-07 09:27:26 EDT <MrsWootDoug> @comcast @Xfinity don't care. My entire neighborhood has no internet and everytime we all try to report it, they say no outage & try to charge to send a repairman. What happens when school starts?? People working from home? Get it together!!
1291726824565886976 2020-08-07 09:24:08 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Sandi. You can report an outage using the instructions here:  https://xfin.tv/2XFzLDP¬†
1291725982303498240 2020-08-07 09:20:47 EDT <staylor2987> Bull. Everyone in our neighborhood is out and you insist there is no outage
1291725493490909185 2020-08-07 09:18:51 EDT <TylerOtten> Hey @comcast @comcastcares @xfinity will I be recieving a credit for  downtime?  This is the SECOND 10+ hour outage we‚Äôve had in the last 30 days. My girlfriend works from home, it‚Äôs a pandemic, what are we paying you for? #comcastoutrage #comcastoutage #Elgin
1291723731182780417 2020-08-07 09:11:51 EDT <Gunzo819> So my Xfinity outage map has updated to say "the issue will be resolved 8/9/2020 at 11:04 pm". That's Sunday. I'm going to lose my fucking mind.
1291722474908987392 2020-08-07 09:06:51 EDT <pat_baumgartner> @comcast @Xfinity 30127 completely down.  No service outage on th map.   On my second reboot and still nothing.
1291721780504264705 2020-08-07 09:04:06 EDT <staylor2987> @Xfinity @comcast what is the point of app/customer service when multiple homes in a neighborhood report an internet outage and you deny that there‚Äôs a problem to each one?
1291717413864714240 2020-08-07 08:46:45 EDT <Xfinity> Hi there. Have you checked your My Account app to see if you are affected by an area outage?
1291714510970134529 2020-08-07 08:35:12 EDT <BHarvey1621> @Xfinity outage in my area that says it will be restored by 11:05 pm on 8/9/20 is unacceptable.
1291707953792376833 2020-08-07 08:09:09 EDT <HeavyMetalLovrr> @Xfinity I live in Flemington NJ, we‚Äôve had no updates on the outage for over 15 hours on the status center. Can we please have an update?
1291686929998766080 2020-08-07 06:45:37 EDT <JTawil> @Xfinity outage in NJ from Tuesday with restoration predicted for 08/09??!  DO BETTER. Can‚Äôt get anyone on the phone and pple rely on WiFi for work from home. DISASTER - what a clown show
1291685500663865344 2020-08-07 06:39:56 EDT <EASTGATEFACE> @Xfinity what is with these long outages? First ETA was 2:30 AM. Pushed back to 6:30 AM. When will we get credits on our bills for these frequent long outages?
1291657672710852608 2020-08-07 04:49:21 EDT <niceDojo> How you gonna have an outage during my discord sleep smh @Xfinity
1291649024559374336 2020-08-07 04:14:59 EDT <caraif> @comcast @Xfinity outage still in #Canton no ETA. No answers.
1291647492438753281 2020-08-07 04:08:54 EDT <Average_SC> @comcast @Xfinity man, what a bad internet service. Constant outages for up to 12 hours at a time, and then they had the gall to ask why it‚Äôs not working. As if it‚Äôs not them making the problem.
1291637781215817734 2020-08-07 03:30:19 EDT <BrwnEyedSmurf81> Almost 14hrs with no internet...I wonder how many other SP‚Äôs still have outages besides mine?   @Xfinity  when will the issue be fixed? I need to work and don‚Äôt have an alternate solution since our office is closed due to COVID.
1291609373740077057 2020-08-07 01:37:26 EDT <mjgchick> I‚Äôm tired of @Xfinity and y‚Äôall outages. That‚Äôs I only kept the internet. Y‚Äôall make people pay to much for such bullshit.
1291597290940043265 2020-08-07 00:49:25 EDT <Byuyu_> An XFINITY Internet outage has been reported in your area. We're working hard to get your service up and running.

Even if I were to get fiber from xfinity, it would still have the random dumbass outages. I‚Äôm genuinely screwed and just have to deal with it until xfinity fixes their shit out here.
1291579594013904897 2020-08-06 23:39:06 EDT <jumpmanbull> @comcastcares 2nd time this month there is an internet outage in my area? Can I get some type of explanation on what is going on? #help #xfinity

1291561200245829634 2020-08-06 22:26:00 EDT <iAmZedric> @Xfinity I literally had to start singing until he connected me to a manager. All for the manager to tell me there an outage on my street.
1291559895326654464 2020-08-06 22:20:49 EDT <tweetlessSam> @comcast @Xfinity will today's repeated outages be reflected in a credit on my next bill?
1291557299132276736 2020-08-06 22:10:30 EDT <Guilt_VAL> Xfinity back at it again with the outages.
1291555769310117889 2020-08-06 22:04:26 EDT <stiker5799> @Xfinity why is every other state getting their outages fixed before Connecticut we pay as much as they do also , how is having 2.5 days of no WiFi best service ??
1291550706256744449 2020-08-06 21:44:18 EDT <mcnelliswrites> Really annoyed at @xfinity for not even providing updates on the outage. This has been day two. Unable to get any work done because my cell signal (also with them) hasn‚Äôt been strong enough to run my computer off of. Not a peep from them.
1291547197327183873 2020-08-06 21:30:22 EDT <Adiofreak> Hey @Xfinity why do I even sign up for outage alerts if you don‚Äôt send them?
1291542810617942018 2020-08-06 21:12:56 EDT <bon75> Hey @xfinity @comcast How about some communication on the wifi outage other than "there is an outage in your area" - no shit! For 2 full days now
1291541038025383939 2020-08-06 21:05:53 EDT <BrwnEyedSmurf81> Have power (Hamden) but no internet to work. @Xfinity reports ‚Äúan outage in your area‚Äù with no estimated restoration time.

1291517923861897216 2020-08-06 19:34:02 EDT <Loyalknick> @Xfinity the outage map is cool but without an ETA, the map is useless

1291514106185420801 2020-08-06 19:18:52 EDT <dandaly71> @Xfinity   Guess what another outage.   Just about every day since 6/28.   Done with you guys !! Switching back to AT&T !
1291513233090650112 2020-08-06 19:15:24 EDT <__Chaby> You would think moving to silicon valley would make your @Xfinity service better but the same ol #ConCast dropping support calls, internet outages, and excessive wait times beyond the time estimated. #SAD

1291507412084678656 2020-08-06 18:52:16 EDT <grimmwerks> @xfinity Just adding onto the outage outrage: nothing here in mid CT.  Strange though as it was fine through the storm and afterward, up until 3am yesterday...

1291498856828547073 2020-08-06 18:18:17 EDT <alzibluk> Dear Xfinity - How do I report an outage? No internet or cable. I need to tell work something. I'm in Bethany, CT. #xfinityoutage
1291497621840891904 2020-08-06 18:13:22 EDT <Spyro_PD> 2nd outage in one day. Big service :)
1291496856413929477 2020-08-06 18:10:20 EDT <BlakeHudsonNJ> @Xfinity my service has been out for 3 days and there is no update.  I can‚Äôt speak to a live person when I call your 800#.  The outage map does not give any information other than there is an outage.  I understand that outages happen with storms, but the support after matters.
1291493513956339712 2020-08-06 17:57:03 EDT <Greebull> @Xfinity i hope you guys are going to give us paying customers a pro-rated refund for today‚Äôs outage.
1291490016342966276 2020-08-06 17:43:09 EDT <joshkeesee> Thanks for the reply! Yes, it does indicate an outage each time.
1291486734312767490 2020-08-06 17:30:06 EDT <mmaz1375> I pay way too much money for the Internet to be down this long. It came on at 9:30 and back off around 4 o‚Äôclock. 19087 outage.   #Comcast #Comcastoutage #Comcastdown #Xfinity #XFINITY #XfinityOutage #ComcastInternetDown #XfinityDown
1291486469421506560 2020-08-06 17:29:03 EDT <rjburnsva> @Xfinity 3rd internet outage in 24 hours.  Our @Xfinity doesn‚Äôt work more often than it does.  On permanent hold for ‚Äúhelp‚Äù.  WTH?
1291483802146136067 2020-08-06 17:18:27 EDT <LadyGamer55> Sorry no stream this afternoon, my daughter has lost internet thanks to a massive Comcast/Xfinity outage. We'll try for later tonight if it's restored at a reasonable hour!
1291478897612042240 2020-08-06 16:58:58 EDT <Suzzicks> Me f'n too!!!! It is embarrassing when internet goes out, and this is WHAT I DO - INTERNET STUFF. I pay for the highest package they have, and still - An outage today derailed a webinar that I was recording for - luckily not live, but time is money - for all of us!! @Xfinity
1291478526994944000 2020-08-06 16:57:30 EDT <bambibuckingham> This xfinity outage is homophobic
1291478440084934658 2020-08-06 16:57:09 EDT <abekoff> @Xfinity   Nobody does it worse than #xfinity  we understand storms and outages but not lies and lack of comminication. We have had no service for 2 days all of our neigbors have it but not our building. All we get from #xfinity are LIES, 2 hours then another 2 hours now 60hrs!
1291477883895066624 2020-08-06 16:54:56 EDT <XclusiveStoriz> It was a outage in the area
1291477823786557442 2020-08-06 16:54:42 EDT <LolabelleLizzy> @Xfinity Is there an outage in Miami or something? The internet and TV have been out all day and I need it for school...
1291476747586871297 2020-08-06 16:50:25 EDT <BerlepschBeams> nah it‚Äôs always good and it‚Äôs just out because of the tropical storm I just wanna know when it‚Äôll be back went 2 days w/o power then came back at like 1 am this morning and now there‚Äôs an outage like EVERYwhere around me
1291475059631108097 2020-08-06 16:43:43 EDT <_samdaviss> Hey @Xfinity we have had 13th outages in the past week for ‚Äúmaintenance‚Äù and I cannot work from home DURING A PANDEMIC with no internet. If I could have anyone else for my internet and TV I would.
1291472923828592641 2020-08-06 16:35:14 EDT <LouiseMontville> @comcast @Xfinity a little more communication on the outages would be really helpful.
1291472822599114753 2020-08-06 16:34:49 EDT <crisco_r> Imagine running a software company in Boulder, CO with client releases due during yet another outage... we switched to CenturyLink fiber line.
1291472744132096000 2020-08-06 16:34:31 EDT <amelbeach> According toy account on your website there is no outage my accnt is upto date.  I‚Äôve sent and paid TWO handyman to check on YOUR product and they both say the same thing    The boxes are not working!  This is an investment property that I am now getting bad reviews bc of Xfinity
1291472051295805440 2020-08-06 16:31:46 EDT <loboholic> Hooray. Haven't had a @Xfinity outage in a while. Guess it's our turn in the barrel today
1291472010112008193 2020-08-06 16:31:36 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Amelia. Have you checked in the Xfinity My Account app yet to see if there was an outage affecting that address?
1291470449164062748 2020-08-06 16:25:24 EDT <Xfinity> Does your My Account app indicate that you're in an area outage when this happens?
1291469909487161356 2020-08-06 16:23:15 EDT <lolkstew> Leave it to Xfinity to be doing minor maintenance and cause a full neighborhood outage for the rest of the day
1291466279623233548 2020-08-06 16:08:50 EDT <adamhill816> @Xfinity any eta on a fix for the outage in CT
1291463908126072833 2020-08-06 15:59:24 EDT <RLeechi> @Xfinity @comcastcares Any update on when the outage will be over in Scotch Plains, NJ. It's been 2 days. Since most of us have to work from home it's rather annoying to have this outage go on for so long!
1291462739576094721 2020-08-06 15:54:45 EDT <FrankQ55> Great job @Xfinity and @tmobile both failed me with outages in my area! Missed out huge!  https://twitter.com/mono_trader/status/1291461837817556992¬†‚Ä¶
1291461827076005890 2020-08-06 15:51:08 EDT <FrankQ55> Today was my worst and best day ever trading! I missed an entry point to make Thousands! to not give an exact amount. All because @TMobile  and @Xfinity are experiencing outages since 11a this FUCKING MORNING!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1291460142475743232 2020-08-06 15:44:26 EDT <joshkeesee> Hey @Xfinity  - outages in the middle and near the end of the day every day this week. As a family who all work from home, having our internet drop during a conference call three days in a row is unacceptable. Makes us look unprofessional.
1291459398620057601 2020-08-06 15:41:29 EDT <Lynch_TheGrinch> @Xfinity can you please work on this outage? Still trying to work from home and multiple outages in a week is getting a bit much.
1291455271475253248 2020-08-06 15:25:05 EDT <_DavidLeBlanc> It says a technician is performing maitenence in my area, I have not checked this information before but sporadically the past few weeks I have lost internet with the ‚Äòoutage reported‚Äô in the app.
1291453807378006018 2020-08-06 15:19:16 EDT <Xfinity> Got it. When you see this message, there's an outage reported in your area. If you click where it says "internet" and then "outage map," there should be some more information for you. Is this a message that you're seeing frequently?
1291453266719629316 2020-08-06 15:17:07 EDT <Welles_7> @Xfinity no ETA on my area outage. Was wondering if you could help. Thanks
1291452480006520832 2020-08-06 15:13:59 EDT <kbk217> @Xfinity @comcast Talk about crap customer service!  Me and my neighbors called yesterday to report an outage from the storm to be told we were wrong no outage. Rep shows up 30 hours later and Yup OUTAGE no ETA. GET IT 2gether!!
1291452216629395457 2020-08-06 15:12:57 EDT <cagedmonster_> @comcastcares @Xfinity you said the outage would be restored yesterday morning and then you kept pushing it back later and later into the day, and now all it says is ‚Äúas soon as possible.‚Äù Get your act together, its Day 3 of the outage. Give real times, not your fake hopeful ones
1291449923188281349 2020-08-06 15:03:50 EDT <cagedmonster_> You‚Äôve got some nerve showing up in my ads like this, Xfinity. Your outage times are all lies and you know it.
1291448907722104840 2020-08-06 14:59:48 EDT <Xfinity> Hi. Does the Xfinity My Account app show an area outage?
1291448332683026435 2020-08-06 14:57:31 EDT <Xfinity> Keep updated through the Xfinity My Account app. There may be an outage affecting the area and there are troubleshooting steps you can do to optimize your connection.
1291446267931918341 2020-08-06 14:49:18 EDT <Xfinity> Hi there. You can check the Xfinity My Account app for outage updates.
1291444965827129344 2020-08-06 14:44:08 EDT <jhoetzl> @Xfinity @comcast @comcastcares can I at least get some response about recovery time ? ComcastCares is not responding and the outage map ‚Äúdetails‚Äù provides no timeframe (anymore).
1291444238526423041 2020-08-06 14:41:14 EDT <Xfinity> Sorry for the downtime. Are you in an area outage currently?
1291444096607948800 2020-08-06 14:40:41 EDT <xxMarsxz> To those of you also effect by the Xfinity outage, yelling at them isn‚Äôt going to make them fix it faster lmao
1291443851870326784 2020-08-06 14:39:42 EDT <btaylor_71> #xfinity #comcast  took zoom out from network outage map. They don‚Äôt want people to see size of Internet lock out. @GeorgWebb @tracybeanz @GovMurphy @FrankPallone @PoliticalOrgy pic.twitter.com/us9PTL2za9
1291443589235400704 2020-08-06 14:38:40 EDT <chamberskl> @Xfinity are you going to reimburse me for all my internet outages that are becoming detrimental to my job? No warning. Two days in a row.
1291443077480095746 2020-08-06 14:36:38 EDT <JAY_DA_BE> @Xfinity why are you doing this to us??? üò≠üò≠üò≠-WFH (outage) lol
1291442998174273537 2020-08-06 14:36:19 EDT <girl__ow> @Xfinity is it possible to check if there's a service outage in a certain zipcode? or an address?
1291442123955482624 2020-08-06 14:32:50 EDT <AbsorptionLuL> @Xfinity would really appreaciatr if you guys can get your things situated. I have had packet loss that goes over 70 % for more than 5 months now, and the app tells me nothing about an outage or that anything wrong is going on. We even got a technician to come see it, he fixed it
1291441121365819393 2020-08-06 14:28:51 EDT <GrandmaCheesy77> I literally just installed it last night. And I don‚Äôt need it to tell me there is an outage; I‚Äôm pretty clear on that. I need YALL to get my wifi WORKING again.
1291440434649104384 2020-08-06 14:26:08 EDT <Xfinity> Not a bot üö´ ü§ñ I understand the frustrations that come along with an internet outage. I can assure you, our techs are working diligently to get things back up and running. Once you login on the app, you shouldn't have to continue to login. When you can, reinstall the app.
1291439635642699778 2020-08-06 14:22:57 EDT <GrandmaCheesy77> Bot, i am currently conducting all work/business on my cell phone BECAUSE OF THIS OUTAGE. I downloaded the app but it doesn‚Äôt always recognize my login info 1/
1291439220763045888 2020-08-06 14:21:18 EDT <MichaelAltiero> When I tweeted this there was nothing listed. Now it‚Äôs showing an area outage again in 07090
1291438731036155911 2020-08-06 14:19:21 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Michael. Does the My Account app show an area outage or is there no info at all listed?
1291438580838150145 2020-08-06 14:18:46 EDT <Xfinity> Hi there. Have you used the Xfinity My Account app yet? All updated information on outages in the area will be listed there!
1291438331818106882 2020-08-06 14:17:46 EDT <Xfinity> Hi there! Are you experiencing an outage or having general issues with your service? You can visit the Xfinity My Account app for outage info in your area and troubleshooting tips for your service.
1291437676458123268 2020-08-06 14:15:10 EDT <brian_jankowski> @Xfinity you guys are horrible. Not for the outages in my area, but for the lack of anything that would resemble good customer service. Your automated message literally tells me that your representatives won‚Äôt be able to help me... Is that so they don‚Äôt have to do their jobs?
1291430965928235009 2020-08-06 13:48:30 EDT <creatingfavors> @Xfinity can I get a discount for all these outages?
1291429556176465921 2020-08-06 13:42:54 EDT <mikeberg> @Xfinity Would it be possible to get a heads up whenever a technician will be performing maintenance in our area? It‚Äôs frustrating when the connection is bouncing up and down all morning.  A text msg would be nice...even for outages.  pic.twitter.com/SVz7kLKlO5
1291427664704811009 2020-08-06 13:35:23 EDT <_allyfrankel> @Xfinity we‚Äôve had an outage for 48 hours and can‚Äôt get any answers as to when it will be fixed. Any help?

I should charge you for missed #teleconferences and #virtualmeetings. This sucks BIG time. #WFH #Connectivity #LostRevenue #freelancer pic.twitter.com/cVs0TCWwIT
1291422309971046402 2020-08-06 13:14:06 EDT <MCruzMissile> Husband: There‚Äôs an unplanned Xfinity outage in the area..no cable or internet   Me: ugh, dumb. Can you put on Hulu?  Hulu: .........
1291421221092040709 2020-08-06 13:09:47 EDT <tthrash> So I just messaged @Xfinity a few minutes ago to try to get an update on this latest outage. Not even two minutes later an Xfinity truck pulls into my driveway. Well, that was fast, eh? Nope, the driver was just making a U-turn. Sigh. Still, maybe we're getting closer...
1291417075764920322 2020-08-06 12:53:18 EDT <Kazisanwar> 3 outages in less than a week. All on working days. Call me ATT.
1291416059417944071 2020-08-06 12:49:16 EDT <vanessa_adelee> @Xfinity This outage is being handled so unbelievably poorly I feel like I am living in the year 1985..there is absolutely NO excuse to keep customers completely in the dark & not offer real time updates on your social platforms as to what‚Äôs going on and when it will be resolved
1291415942203871233 2020-08-06 12:48:48 EDT <F1HamFan> Hey .@Xfinity since I‚Äôve been working from home everyday, there have been so many internet outages, it‚Äôs driving me crazy. How about you all start reimbursing is for every minute we lose internet service? This starting to be a large business impact....
1291415421761929216 2020-08-06 12:46:44 EDT <Silverddragn> Shoutout to @Xfinity for delivering this to us the morning of our internet outage üôÉ  pic.twitter.com/9ZEgoDtzej
1291414278633861120 2020-08-06 12:42:12 EDT <jdcastellente> Oh I have. It's useless. Even signed up for text updates. No updates.  It's annoying for there to be long outages when everyone is basically working from home.
1291413184839127040 2020-08-06 12:37:51 EDT <njean_baptiste> @Xfinity hi I‚Äôve had an outage in NJ for the past two days. Any update on when this might be fixed? I work from home and need to access the internet. Please respond ASAP.
1291411086802128897 2020-08-06 12:29:31 EDT <Xfinity> Sorry for the frustration. Any updates on this outage will be provided in your My Account app.
1291410654784622595 2020-08-06 12:27:48 EDT <louismlyons> How do I get live tech support from @verizonfios @VerizonSupport ? I have tried for three days to get in touch with a person and now on hold on their call-back service (they called me!). No power outages in area. Just not interested in helping me I guess. Next call is @Xfinity
1291410632143769601 2020-08-06 12:27:42 EDT <Xfinity> Be sure to check the My Account app throughout the duration of the outage to track your service and find updates and possible restoration estimates.
1291410205490774022 2020-08-06 12:26:00 EDT <mookmanshawty> Internet outage üëÄü§¨
1291409890834026496 2020-08-06 12:24:45 EDT <amyfayj> #xfinity Outages in area, no possible way to speak to an agent.  System screw ups saying the outage has been resolved.  How do we get an update?
1291409243539726336 2020-08-06 12:22:11 EDT <Xfinity> Be sure to check the My Account app throughout the duration of the outage to track your service and find updates and possible restoration estimates.
1291408911900315650 2020-08-06 12:20:52 EDT <PoundSignDead> @Xfinity what‚Äôs up with this outage? It‚Äôs been 3 days now
1291408177137942528 2020-08-06 12:17:57 EDT <BarbaraKimmel> Checking eligibility? Hmm- app shows service outage affecting 2000. No service for 24 hours. Who is eligible and who isn't? Is it a lottery?
1291404281938157568 2020-08-06 12:02:28 EDT <aglongo> Thank you @Verizon for remaining operational during and after this storm.  @Comcast seems to be completely failing us.  Had internet until right after the storm and then outage.  @Xfinity stopped even updating the time line and just relies on ASAP.  No details at all.
1291404205329207297 2020-08-06 12:02:10 EDT <xoqueenn> @Xfinity I am so sick of the frequent outages I experience with your internet service! I am now unable to complete my work since this current outage in my area is expected to last until 3:30. This is absurd. You all have awful service!
1291403686997041153 2020-08-06 12:00:06 EDT <toosminho> @Xfinity it‚Äôs been 3 days. can you pls fix the outage in ct
1291401966095159297 2020-08-06 11:53:16 EDT <themrshemingway> Nope. The site just says there's an outage and we tried calling and chat, no updates.
1291400612727459855 2020-08-06 11:47:53 EDT <Xfinity> Hi. If you're in an area outage, keep an eye on your My Account app -- it will provide updates as they are available.
1291399768950943745 2020-08-06 11:44:32 EDT <Vittoriosa_> I have an online #FLBarExam on the 19th and @Xfinity decides to give me a heart attack with an internet outage? Bad enough we have to deal with ILG possibly going down, now this...  pic.twitter.com/AdTE1GzDKH
1291399273456820224 2020-08-06 11:42:34 EDT <cocoachic76> Yes I see the outage in my area is expected to continue until 2. After I‚Äôve missed at least three zoom meetings.
1291397922010075147 2020-08-06 11:37:12 EDT <koolestindian2> Xfinity has an outage so I can‚Äôt work üôÑ
1291395228348420096 2020-08-06 11:26:30 EDT <XclusiveStoriz> Another @Xfinity outage damn what is up with y‚Äôall ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1291393650535145472 2020-08-06 11:20:13 EDT <itsthatguytrav> There was a power outage and the internet was gone for about 3 days give or take but it‚Äôs back thank you
1291392083689967617 2020-08-06 11:14:00 EDT <cocoachic76> @Xfinity always has a power outage. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1291390780247027712 2020-08-06 11:08:49 EDT <_lindseylouwho> Update: still no cable or internet. I can‚Äôt talk to anyone on the phone at @Xfinity until the outage is restored but no one on the chat can give me a restoration time...that‚Äôs cool. Not like anyone is working from home right now. We don‚Äôt need the services.   #ihatexfinity
1291389728038756353 2020-08-06 11:04:38 EDT <lindsknight> @Xfinity please please fix the outages in my area.
1291386268685930497 2020-08-06 10:50:53 EDT <Wulfspade2> @Xfinity instead of having everyone look at your fucking shitty busted app why dont you idk JUST FIX IT FIX IT YOU MAKE 100 BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY BUT YOU CANNOT FIX ANY OUTAGES IN ANY REASONABLE TIME COSTING HUNDRED OF PEOPLE MONEY
1291385706556936194 2020-08-06 10:48:39 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Malia. If you're affected by an area outage, be sure to keep an eye on the My Account app -- it will be updated as we have info to share.
1291385210530074624 2020-08-06 10:46:41 EDT <TaylorEspo> Hey @Xfinity, telling you I have an outage and you giving me Saturday to send a tech over to fix it is unacceptable. I work from home and have to teach a class on Saturday. If you can‚Äôt send someone over today, I‚Äôm fucking canceling this shit service.
1291384930870554624 2020-08-06 10:45:34 EDT <oldmantrox> My third day in new position and I have an Xfinity outage so I can‚Äôt log in smh... not a good look ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1291384461821714432 2020-08-06 10:43:43 EDT <maliaxsuai> @UnitedIllum outage AND @Xfinity outage and neither one has been attended to?!? wow super great! especially because the UI outage affects almost 900 people and the xfinity one affects around 2500 people!!
1291384435112321036 2020-08-06 10:43:36 EDT <Xfinity> Are you in an area outage?
1291383901626273792 2020-08-06 10:41:29 EDT <Xfinity> Are you in an area outage?
1291382420445462528 2020-08-06 10:35:36 EDT <Chapinc> Day 2 of @comcast @Xfinity outage. Customer app now does not open/work, so no updates. Cannot speak to a rep. Horrible service, horrible response.
1291381271919243265 2020-08-06 10:31:02 EDT <TrinaaSayys> Xfinity Always On Bullshit Talking Bout Outage In The Area Hurry Up & Fix This Shit
1291380044976328706 2020-08-06 10:26:10 EDT <SammyMarieee> Hey @comcast @Xfinity why is this the second day in a row we are experiencing service outages? We‚Äôre all sitting here trying to work from home and you can‚Äôt maintain service, even though we pay you an exorbitant amount of $$$
1291378129685053440 2020-08-06 10:18:33 EDT <MicahCLogan> OMG yess I have!! ü§¶üèæ. Several times. Your own automated systems and outage map literally says there is an outage in the area. So it‚Äôs not my modem. Can we at least get an estimated time of restoral in instead of ‚Äúas soon as possible‚Äù.
1291378015868510209 2020-08-06 10:18:06 EDT <ian_b_cohen> Morning. I am not sure where to start.  Everyday slowness.  Outages in our area on a constant basis. We even went as far as buying the ‚ÄúWiFi xfi PODS‚Äù to increase the speed.  While that has helped a little bit, my internet speed still sits at roughly 39 MBPS.
1291374667991855104 2020-08-06 10:04:48 EDT <JerseyGirlJoey> Will you pay peoples wages for time missed due to this outage? What happens if they get fired because of this extended outage? I think it‚Äôs time @Xfinity took a little more responsibility instead of these generic responses  https://twitter.com/Xfinity/status/1291374092961165312¬†‚Ä¶
1291374598408347649 2020-08-06 10:04:31 EDT <KingRuka_> Gotta love a huge xfinity outage they dont even know when it's going to be up shits great tho no internet or tv during quarantine love that for me
1291374525750419457 2020-08-06 10:04:14 EDT <miloandmisty> @Xfinity NO NO NO NO NO. People are working from home! Internet outages two days in a row for more than half the day is UNACCEPTABLE!
1291373790220431360 2020-08-06 10:01:18 EDT <femmetron9000> me calling xfinity to fix this outage  pic.twitter.com/g9isiPrEr2
1291370455874535427 2020-08-06 09:48:03 EDT <rundawnrun> No. It says no outage
1291370146200727553 2020-08-06 09:46:50 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Dawn. Does your My Account App indicate that you're in an area outage?
1291366586310418432 2020-08-06 09:32:41 EDT <JerseyGirlJoey> Xfinity down with this outage for 3 days now. It is outrageous! All these poor people working from home!! Can people be fired if they can‚Äôt work due to the outage? And if that‚Äôs the case can @Xfinity @comcastcares be held responsible for not adequately fixing this major issue?
1291361713456119811 2020-08-06 09:13:19 EDT <Xfinity> Hey. Check out this link for more info on the storm related outage:  https://xfin.tv/2C7oiFu¬†.
1291361623375065088 2020-08-06 09:12:58 EDT <Xfinity> Hi April. Have you checked your Xfinity My Account app to see if there's an outage in your area?
1291360168366804992 2020-08-06 09:07:11 EDT <kurometarikku> Sure great look forward to hearing another lie about there not being an outage here.
1291360146178875392 2020-08-06 09:07:05 EDT <Xfinity> Hi, Laura. We don't want you to be frustrated, we can help here. Are you in an area outside outage currently?
1291359068083412996 2020-08-06 09:02:48 EDT <kurometarikku> Do I even bother calling @Xfinity today? The script they have support stick to doesn‚Äôt even allow for them to acknowledge there is an outage in my area.
1291359013725143041 2020-08-06 09:02:35 EDT <bradwolak> Definitely feeling an 8 right now because @Xfinity @comcastcares still hasn‚Äôt restored our service and kept pushing back the restored time until now when it says ‚Äúoutage reported‚Äù and no time to restoration üò°  https://twitter.com/ProjectLincoln/status/1291357699322634242¬†‚Ä¶
1291357544703758337 2020-08-06 08:56:45 EDT <TAEdisonFan> @Xfinity @comcastcares our comcast service is down. Our power was restored last night.  We are one of the few comcast users in this area so want to be sure our outage is registered.
1291354943685877760 2020-08-06 08:46:25 EDT <MicahCLogan> @Xfinity Ok so I understand having an outage after the storm two days ago. But the service came back on and has been in and out ever since for hours at a time. I‚Äôm missing out on work here, what‚Äôs going on??
1291354903852482561 2020-08-06 08:46:15 EDT <Xfinity> We apologize for the downtime, are you in an area outage currently?
1291353818152800258 2020-08-06 08:41:57 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Amy. Is there an outage in your area?
1291351194917580808 2020-08-06 08:31:31 EDT <RowdyMaya> I've had Xfinity svc since it was Time Warner & Comcast. There are times when they have outages in my 77021 zip code but they tend to correct them the same day. Mostly its reliable.
1291348769473212416 2020-08-06 08:21:53 EDT <Paranoiamoon> Is there @Xfinity Comcast outages in Florence, Al? My internet has been up and down since yesterday....
1291342982327795713 2020-08-06 07:58:53 EDT <BraverSoul> Internet went down last night from an Xfinity outage and it still isn't back üôÉ
1291337482370527232 2020-08-06 07:37:02 EDT <kddecourcey> @Xfinity - Is there an #outage in the Goodlettsville, TN area, zip code 37072? And don‚Äôt ask for my address, because I‚Äôm asking for someone that lives in the area and aren‚Äôt able to get online, to work.
1291310865497694208 2020-08-06 05:51:16 EDT <ThaKidd_quan> S/o Xfinity & Verizon for getting it together.. still waiting for eversource to realize it‚Äôs power outages
1291294188198342658 2020-08-06 04:45:00 EDT <CORVFANG> @comcastcares xfinity outage for 36+ hours, no estimate to when it‚Äôll be back. this is getting ridiculous. could I get some support?
1291261008959291393 2020-08-06 02:33:09 EDT <ckscatterbrain> weak ass xfinity got a outage or some shit fuckin up my videos dawg
1291254829952753664 2020-08-06 02:08:36 EDT <dpag987> @Xfinity this is absurd now. First your outage map says 500-1000 affected and the time for the internet to return is 11:06. It‚Äôs 2 am and it‚Äôs still not back and it shows 1000-2500 people affected. What the hell is going on.
1291243012102774784 2020-08-06 01:21:38 EDT <drenchattack> Without fail there is always a magical internet outage when I'm about to game late in the evening. Thanks, @Xfinity.
1291240565087113223 2020-08-06 01:11:55 EDT <JonathanDylla> You guys need to update your customers of the Internet/TV outage because all of your customers don‚Äôt have a clue what‚Äôs going on and when everything‚Äôs gonna go back up.
1291238541398286337 2020-08-06 01:03:52 EDT <_notoriousMEISH> Ooooh Xfinity def got me fucked up bitch outage my ass I‚Äôm tryna play the game
1291238308736045057 2020-08-06 01:02:57 EDT <caroeclem> Is anybody else in the DC area experiencing similar outages from @comcast or Xfinity? If so, I‚Äôm curious to hear your workaround, as so many of us depend on Quality of Service to do our jobs from home with limited backup options @PoPville @DCist @washingtonian @postlocal
1291223705964732418 2020-08-06 00:04:55 EDT <BrianELI> @Xfinity has been out in my area now for quite some time after a power outage in early evening. Any other outages in davis county (@nslchat, @woodscrosscity) or salt lake county? I'm told it will be another 3 hours (after midnight) before it's back on.  Please help!
1291204850102001664 2020-08-05 22:50:00 EDT <kurometarikku> @Xfinity customer service is the worst, they keep telling me there is no outage here even though everyone on the block has no internet
1291200766682836992 2020-08-05 22:33:46 EDT <trippyspeedster> @Xfinity hope you guys hurry up and fix whatever‚Äôs wrong in ashburn 20147. It‚Äôs been 4 and half hours since this outage. Must be serious. üò™always something
1291199323649249288 2020-08-05 22:28:02 EDT <_mariomichael> It would be cool if @Xfinity could fix this outage. I can‚Äôt work from home without internet üôÉ@comcast
1291198137428738049 2020-08-05 22:23:19 EDT <arupnanda> @comcastcares xfinity has been dead for last 2 days in Danbury CT after the storm and all xFi app says is ‚Äúthere is an outage reported‚Äù. This is shameful for the kind of money you charge and the service is down for 2 days when we need to work. Just tell me when? That‚Äôs all.
1291198022966181889 2020-08-05 22:22:52 EDT <FromExes> Ongoing power outages. No cable or Wi fi. @Xfinity  supposedly working on the problem. Tons of crews all over the place taking down trees & branches. It‚Äôs a mess #TropicalStormIsaias üå™üí®
1291192160067485696 2020-08-05 21:59:34 EDT <_mc2nv_> Seriously! I'm so done with this company! I regret leaving Vzn, when I was with them for 14 yrs, their interuptions were non-existent. With @Xfinity @comcast for 18 mos, countless of outages! This 5+ hrs of no service was the nail in the coffin!  https://twitter.com/ShangoSoul/status/1291039999333412868¬†‚Ä¶
1291191087709728768 2020-08-05 21:55:19 EDT <jennaf_1> @Xfinity sooo y‚Äôall said you would be up and running at 9:12... mind you this outage happen at 5 pm today. WHAT ARE YALL DOING? No internet no cable no way to stream a thing üò°ü§¨üò°ü§¨  pic.twitter.com/Jck1PRbdbu

1291189930547388417 2020-08-05 21:50:43 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Julia. We understand the inconvenience this service outage has caused and our techs are working to get everything restored asap. Please keep checking the My Account app for updates.
1291188084953042944 2020-08-05 21:43:23 EDT <Xfinity> We understand the inconvenience this service outage has caused, and our techs are working to get everything restored asap. Please keep checking the My Account app for updates.
1291187043087921152 2020-08-05 21:39:14 EDT <Torns> have had an Internet/cable outage for over a day and there‚Äôs currently no eta of when it‚Äôs gonna be fixed or the current situation.
1291186470439591936 2020-08-05 21:36:58 EDT <IAmSophiaNelson> @Xfinity you need to work on your customer service skills. Why do we have an outage with no rain. No storm. Nothing but blue skies. For hours? Why?
1291183834088734720 2020-08-05 21:26:29 EDT <_bethcarey> Eff you @Xfinity and your all day outages.  #thanksfornothing
1291179957595627521 2020-08-05 21:11:05 EDT <s_tafari> @Xfinity can‚Äôt get through to your service center .. 2 houses both have outages at zip 20175 and 20176. No notifications , no updates .. just stuck in VRUs from hell! #xfinityoutage #internet
1291175935434199040 2020-08-05 20:55:06 EDT <MidTNAng> I do not envy @WCSedu teachers/staff/admin. After two 15 min "Meet the Teacher" Zooms I walked away with 1) @Xfinity had an outage in our hood for the last few days and several homes couldn't access the meetings. How do we handle that? How do we not eat into my internet only data
1291174706025046016 2020-08-05 20:50:13 EDT <Stephpezz15> @Xfinity please explain the 3 days of outages we have had in the 37135 area.  No communication about planned outages and just 2 days before the entire county/state begins remote learning from home. All of my neighbors are suggesting I move to United with fiber üò°
1291174637838245889 2020-08-05 20:49:57 EDT <1LizFowler> @RepDevinCarney any news on Eversource power outage and expectations to restore power? Xfinity Comcast also down. Really subpar performance - think these companies should be held to a standard. Esp the public utility.
1291174524780593152 2020-08-05 20:49:30 EDT <Cryptix_XIII> @Xfinity how long is this outage? It‚Äôs been 2 days now. I need my service
1291173413885825024 2020-08-05 20:45:05 EDT <WarReady422> @Xfinity going on almost 2 full days now with no service yet all you guys seem to be doing is offering false timetables as to when this outage will be fixed. Nobody in my neighborhood with xfinity has service, none of your reps know anything, what‚Äôs up ????
1291171431993225221 2020-08-05 20:37:12 EDT <TalkToEmShi> @Xfinity COUNT YOUR DAYSüò°. My internet has been down since 11 am this morning. I had to use Pto for the duration of my day since I couldn‚Äôt work and it‚Äôs 8:35 pm and it‚Äôs still a service outage. Put some pep in your step,please and thank you‚ÄºÔ∏èidc what you have to do but FIX IT
1291171317371281409 2020-08-05 20:36:45 EDT <1LizFowler> @Xfinity when will you fix this outage
1291165894236868609 2020-08-05 20:15:12 EDT <sspaz1000> Another day another Xfinity outage. At least I'm hoping this was is storm related.  No TV, internet, or phone.
1291165069968125953 2020-08-05 20:11:56 EDT <ComcastNewEng> A reminder to CT & NY customers affected by Isaias, download the My Account app for updates on anticipated restoration times due to storm outages. Note: If your power is out, your local utility must restore power before Xfinity can safely restore services  https://comca.st/2Xtgi9a¬†
1291164043676352512 2020-08-05 20:07:51 EDT <JerseyGirlJoey> People stuck at home due to COVID including elderly without cell phones, people working from home, kids of all ages taking classes online and the best @Xfinity @comcastcares can do after 2 DAYS is tell us they are working on the Xfinity outage. You guys should be freakin ashamed.
1291155621111365632 2020-08-05 19:34:23 EDT <jahiemboi_> comcast outage for 1 day and 4 hours. gotta love it. @Xfinity @comcastcares u guys been shit for years

1291136668871925765 2020-08-05 18:19:04 EDT <JerseyGirlJoey> 2 day xfinity outage is unacceptable. Especially considering all those people working from home right now who will need to take time off because of this. I‚Äôm outraged but I can‚Äôt even imagine how helpless they are feeling
1291136383101345794 2020-08-05 18:17:56 EDT <uchihamyg> not xfinity having another outage again u know what im switching internet companies paying too much for Nothing
1291134680478212099 2020-08-05 18:11:10 EDT <ThirteenOhEight> Welp. Internet outage in the area. It sure seems to be happening a lot now that I'm back on contract @comcast @Xfinity
1291132143540695040 2020-08-05 18:01:05 EDT <Randy_Cairns> Hey @Xfinity your service is abysmal. Your network seems to go down every few weeks...in Mountain View. That makes working from home very difficult. Get it together. You are a large company w plenty of resources. How about you invest in technology so these outages stop happening?  pic.twitter.com/D9k5H0hcFX
1291131042582102016 2020-08-05 17:56:43 EDT <Xfinity> Are you experiencing an outage? You can keep updated through the Xfinity My Account app.
1291130342422839298 2020-08-05 17:53:56 EDT <_mc2nv_> I think it's hilarious that the @Xfinity app won't let u take screen shots so people won't post the frequent outages that they have. @comcastcares #unreliableservice #xfinity #comcastoutage
1291129051550289921 2020-08-05 17:48:48 EDT <comcast> Have you checked the Xfinity My Account app for outage informaiton? -Gabbie
1291120300495601666 2020-08-05 17:14:02 EDT <ChitoVZ> @Xfinity has a rolling excuse in response to storm-related outages; every so often they change it and roll it foward. Meanwhile, we wait.
1291116759135727620 2020-08-05 16:59:57 EDT <iruptagna> Xfinity reports outage estimates the way I tell my managers when I'll have projects ready

1291111731306082307 2020-08-05 16:39:59 EDT <HunterSTrumpson> @xfinity your website doesn‚Äôt let me post service outage, so I‚Äôll just leave this here:   I have no service. Your website sucks. Have a nice day! #xfinityoutage #comcastoutage #outageoutrage
1291107217886904321 2020-08-05 16:22:03 EDT <Scott_ie_P> @comcastcares @Xfinity  I love how the outage status center keeps up changing the time or don't have an estimated time.  I'm glad to see the lack of urgency or any credit back for lack of service.
1291104301352390656 2020-08-05 16:10:27 EDT <JimsonLima> Yes, CT area still has an outage
1291104130107355142 2020-08-05 16:09:46 EDT <BuchananRC96> @Xfinity How do I report an outage. App is that there are outages in my zip code.  App is saying that my building isn‚Äôt affected, clearly it is. Troubleshooting says there is a problem but wants a to set up a tech appointment - for two days from now.  pic.twitter.com/LCcHdm1GMl
1291103945662894080 2020-08-05 16:09:02 EDT <MbondeAhmad> @Xfinity There has been a periodical internet outage in my area zip code 71129 for the past 3 weeks, what's the problem?
1291103628720316416 2020-08-05 16:07:47 EDT <cmfuertes> I am completely convinced @Xfinity doesn't have anyone actually working on the outage in my area.
1291099475549786112 2020-08-05 15:51:17 EDT <GleeshEBE> @xfinity whats going on with these outages?? üòï season 5 dropped today and I can‚Äôt play COD.
1291098264314535945 2020-08-05 15:46:28 EDT <the_holloway> Y‚Äôall need to get it together @Xfinity . My service has been out all day and yes there‚Äôs an outage. Should have been fixed by now üò§
1291097769839558657 2020-08-05 15:44:30 EDT <EssejTV1> Yes there‚Äôs an area outage. Been out for like 25 hours now
1291097554466344961 2020-08-05 15:43:39 EDT <Xfinity> What's going on with the internet? Do you know if the My Account app shows an area outage?
1291095447164026881 2020-08-05 15:35:16 EDT <Yash_Patel_99> @Xfinity does it really take 24+ hours to fix an outage, or are y‚Äôall just as lazy as everyone says?
1291095333246767111 2020-08-05 15:34:49 EDT <SteveBernich> That‚Äôs fine @Xfinity @comcast you just keep pretending service will be restored in 3 hrs & I‚Äôll just keep spamming you with status update requests for the systemwide outage on the East Coast.  Totally cool.  pic.twitter.com/zzeKkP3v3A
1291094783671390218 2020-08-05 15:32:38 EDT <ScooBeam> I‚Äôm literally gonna lose my mind I need to be practicing for a tournament and they aren‚Äôt helping us it out or what u guys have a internet outage rn?
1291093833829228551 2020-08-05 15:28:52 EDT <whitehawk1186> I do exactly that.  It says no outage, but my entire building has no internet.  Branford CT.  What is going on?
1291092477651247104 2020-08-05 15:23:28 EDT <cooljamz2D> My apartment may have an internet outage for 12 DAYS????? @Xfinity hello???
1291091136950542343 2020-08-05 15:18:09 EDT <Charlo_Napper> @Xfinity Arrgghh!! Another outage?!? Good grief
1291086700412903425 2020-08-05 15:00:31 EDT <crizmmm> @Xfinity @comcastcares What is the purpose of the Status Center if it gives no information during an outage? Map hasn't updated at all in 18 hours and the time estimate has been missed multiple times, adding 3 hours each time. Any way to get real information on outage status?
1291077278894612481 2020-08-05 14:23:05 EDT <MRubner> @Xfinity sucks at providing accurate outage repair updates.  Today's started out at 10:30am, then 2:09pm, now 5:59pm.  Do better!  @comcast
1291077150838345730 2020-08-05 14:22:34 EDT <JustHavinSumFun> Just called @Xfinity and they said there‚Äôs an outage that‚Äôs impacting residents in #DC, Philly, New Jersey and New York. Hopefully back by 6:00pm @PoPville
1291071848076185601 2020-08-05 14:01:30 EDT <windycityswag23> @Xfinity can you please get your shit together! You tell me there‚Äôs an outage then you tell me it‚Äôs restored then you tell me there‚Äôs an outage!! Is there an outage or not???
1291071133219987457 2020-08-05 13:58:39 EDT <Xfinity> You can check your My Account app for info on potential outages in your area.
1291069837326852099 2020-08-05 13:53:30 EDT <A_Little_To_Say> Is there an Xfinity outage in Fishers, IN??
1291068110703919105 2020-08-05 13:46:39 EDT <Ilovetoscore> @Xfinity we have an outage. Our status says our issue will be resolved at a certain time. And that time keeps moving forward a few hours. The first time it gave me was 9pm last night. Right now it says 5pm tonight. What‚Äôs the story?
1291066020577386497 2020-08-05 13:38:20 EDT <Xfinity> Oh no! Does the My Account app show a service outage in the area?
1291063706671910912 2020-08-05 13:29:09 EDT <d_mancill> @Xfinity are you guys going to pay my bill this month? I can‚Äôt use the internet right now because of the outage, which means I can‚Äôt work from home and therefore I won‚Äôt be getting paid for today.
1291059066274549761 2020-08-05 13:10:42 EDT <Cinmer13> No outage
1291058117103386624 2020-08-05 13:06:56 EDT <hannah_fanaika> Two @Xfinity outages in my area in one week? If maintenance is being done your customers need a warning! Lotsof people working from home right now üò´
1291056307294941184 2020-08-05 12:59:44 EDT <Cinmer13> @Xfinity why in the heck does my internet keep going out. Last week outage today just because. Can‚Äôt get one person on the phone, but you guys were quick to increase my bill 20 bucks. Get your shit together. I have to work from home and need WiFi.
1291055090175029253 2020-08-05 12:54:54 EDT <garylfrancione> @Xfinity is the worst cable service in the universe. *Any* rain or wind or snow causes an outage and they are long outages. Anyone have better luck with other providers?
1291050498624290818 2020-08-05 12:36:40 EDT <TheJQ4> This outage is insane
1291047732996702209 2020-08-05 12:25:40 EDT <DullesDistrict> Xfinity sure seems to having issues. We've had outages about every day this week in Ashburn. There's another one going on that's not expected to be fixed until 4 PM. Good thing I have a big data plan on my phone...
1291046468523044868 2020-08-05 12:20:39 EDT <Xfinity> Hey. If you're in an area outage, keep an eye on your My Account app for updates. We're working to get you back up and running ASAP.
1291045888320843779 2020-08-05 12:18:20 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Leah! Understand how this can be frustrating. If you're in an internet outage, we encourage you to check your app or  https://xfin.tv/31jJy3r¬† using a device that can connect another way (like LTE). This is the best & most efficient way to stay updated on the interruption.
1291045789767270402 2020-08-05 12:17:57 EDT <SoB_Corey> Sick time to have an outage @Xfinity I need to work and since it‚Äôs ‚Äúwork from home‚Äù I can‚Äôt üôÑ you‚Äôve changed the time that it will be back 4 times now üßê
1291044435158093824 2020-08-05 12:12:34 EDT <xxwanderess> Xfinity‚Äôs service SUXXXXXX. Outages a few times a week are the new normal and I teach online! What the fuck
1291044219524718594 2020-08-05 12:11:43 EDT <tcannnupe04> There's an internet outage and I'm unable to work. I need a credit on my bill this is crazy
1291042567145115649 2020-08-05 12:05:09 EDT <Xfinity> Hi, we wanted to reach out and let you know that our teams are working hard to restore services in your area. Continue to check Xfinity My Account app throughout the outage to in case the estimated time of restoration decreases.
1291042214626430976 2020-08-05 12:03:45 EDT <reading_while> @Xfinity I called to ask about my internet shortage and the automated call system told me to go online. I don‚Äôt have wifi so unless I‚Äôm not understanding... i can‚Äôt go online. Everyone is working remotely so this outage isn‚Äôt acceptable. (Hyde Park Chicago)
1291039271051300864 2020-08-05 11:52:03 EDT <bytezilla> Xfinity outage in the middle of the day is ruining everything. We have work to do! #xfinityoutage
1291038066702983168 2020-08-05 11:47:16 EDT <St_Akomolafe> @Xfinity estimated time to fix outage getting pushed forward again. Don't promise any time you cannot keep to.
1291037854487937029 2020-08-05 11:46:25 EDT <damfales> Do you have to count it as a rejection if you‚Äôre about to hit send on a pitch and then your wifi goes out and then xfinity says there‚Äôs just a WiFi outage in your whole area?
1291035413604442117 2020-08-05 11:36:43 EDT <Xfinity> Hi. If you're in an area outage, keep an eye on your Xfinity My Account app for updates. We're working to get your services restored ASAP.
1291035198566653954 2020-08-05 11:35:52 EDT <thecarlrod> Why @xfinity do you keep pushing back the time of when the outage will be fixed? Why even promise a time when you don't know if it will be fixed? I need a more detailed response of what is going on. I don't currently believe your updates as it's been pushed back 4 times now
1291029317359607808 2020-08-05 11:12:30 EDT <sledezma22> @comcastcares @Xfinity I‚Äôm trying to be safe and work from home but can‚Äôt do any work without WiFi. Please help. Any ETA on the outage in Mission Bay San Francisco?
1291025891632582658 2020-08-05 10:58:53 EDT <mjandrejko> @Xfinity why even bother to predict when service will be restored?  Took me 3 hours to convince you that I actually had an outage. This morning the first predicted restoration was 742am, then 1132am, and now 230pm. @comcastcares. You keep using that word, but...
1291024902569390080 2020-08-05 10:54:57 EDT <pm_me_ur_waifu> .@xfinity why do I have to log in to check if there's an outage in my area? My roommate keeps trying to call your customer support line but keeps getting hung up on. Our internet has been on and off for the past 2 days and we need the internet to do our jobs  pic.twitter.com/zjfPb7YO80
1291023493467865088 2020-08-05 10:49:21 EDT <ctwin92> @Xfinity after an outage in my area weeks ago my wifi has been at or under 10 Mbps consistently. Was told nobody could come try to fix it, and I have seen no improvement otherwise. What can be done?
1291020694277566464 2020-08-05 10:38:14 EDT <NachelleEdward1> @Xfinity OK honestly your customers deserve to know whats the status on these outages all over the east coast!? I understand there was a bad storm yesterday but still no internet/cable/phone service since yesterday in Baltimore.
1291020153195462656 2020-08-05 10:36:05 EDT <Nwells45319669> Outage on east coast, changed to be fixed times not once not twice but 4 fuckin times knowing people need this shit to provide for their families and work from home. Fuck u xfinity
1291016940077617154 2020-08-05 10:23:19 EDT <Nwells45319669> Laughing stock of the techno industry. Your a joke of a company who provides shit seevice at high prices to customers nation wide. Way to go guys! An outage on the east coast have less thousands unable to work from home and instead of swift Diligent action,
1291016531858653184 2020-08-05 10:21:41 EDT <marlaynabush> not working right. hasn‚Äôt been working right since the outage and then the wire cut. Done modem test....it‚Äôs slow AF. Can‚Äôt stream & use internet with phone, zoom meetings are going in and out...I don‚Äôt pay for this slow of a connection. Stop slowing down my speed!!!
1291015749759377412 2020-08-05 10:18:35 EDT <Acrolisx> Still waiting on the text for the area to clear off outage. This is the 3 day this happen
1291014766576766976 2020-08-05 10:14:40 EDT <RipleyInCT> Hey @Xfinity  It would sure be nice if you prorated our bills during power outages.
1291014572929953793 2020-08-05 10:13:54 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked the app to see if there's an outage in your area? You can also check at  https://xfin.tv/3i9Rzi1¬†
1291013251757756417 2020-08-05 10:08:39 EDT <TheJQ4> @Xfinity Are there major outages currently in the northeast
1291011477462061058 2020-08-05 10:01:36 EDT <fallenfrance> Me waiting for xfinity fix the internet outage  pic.twitter.com/u92DoNfN0f
1291009000113426432 2020-08-05 09:51:46 EDT <psychgirl217> @Xfinity is there an outage reported for 08833? We lost tv and Internet last night
1291008433014087680 2020-08-05 09:49:30 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Michael. What's going on with the service? Does the Xfinity My Account app list an area outage?
1291007652105981952 2020-08-05 09:46:24 EDT <Scoobyyydoo_> Power outage since yesterday afternoon. The timeframe keeps changing for it to get fixed ‚òπÔ∏è
1291007335830298625 2020-08-05 09:45:09 EDT <whatsfordinesq> @Xfinity there is an outage in Springfield, NJ and no update as to when internet may be restored. Working from home and desperately need Internet to do so. Can you please provide an update?
1291002122818015232 2020-08-05 09:24:26 EDT <High_Star_> nope just talking shit cause I get an outage once every two weeks using your crap service and I've never had that issue with any other service
1291000167685120001 2020-08-05 09:16:40 EDT <_Shazayla> @Xfinity Will open accords receive credit for this outage that was supposed to be resolved at 2 am and now says 10 am. This is ridiculous.
1290997632672894976 2020-08-05 09:06:35 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Simon. We do apologize for that experience and want to assure you that our crews work to repair outages - whether due to downed lines or other issues - as quickly as possible. You can check the Xfinity My Account mobile app on your cellular device for estimates on repair time.
1290994724606808064 2020-08-05 08:55:02 EDT <malzadoll> @Xfinity any updates on outages in NJ? App stated specific times through the night and now just says as soon as possible.
1290983208310525952 2020-08-05 08:09:16 EDT <ComcastPhillyNJ> Download the @XFINITY My Account app for updates on anticipated restoration times due to storm outages. Note: If your power goes out, your local utility provider must restore power before Xfinity techs can safely start work to restore services. Learn more:  https://comca.st/3fvS5oW¬†
1290980516414578695 2020-08-05 07:58:35 EDT <Alexei_Segall> Your ‚Äúsupport‚Äù team has been looking into these outages on a weekly occurrence. What a terrible response to all of my other concerns.  It is unacceptable to have outages 25% of the days of the month. It is unacceptable to have planned outages and not tell customers.
1290975903619710977 2020-08-05 07:40:15 EDT <dpag987> @Xfinity my internet was running after 8 hours of outage. Only to wake up that there is another outage. Who‚Äôs going to compensate me for my lost wages?
1290975279108829187 2020-08-05 07:37:46 EDT <TJamesIndState> Don't know if we have a xfinity outage in our neighborhood or not. But nothing is working this morning.
1290968799722733570 2020-08-05 07:12:01 EDT <jux9000> Yeah, there‚Äôs outages all over CT this morning
1290953042058072066 2020-08-05 06:09:24 EDT <Gamermike87> @Xfinity is there a service outage in Burlington ct 06013? My friend lives there and hasn‚Äôt been online all day kinda worried about them
1290933759072665600 2020-08-05 04:52:47 EDT <thevulgarone> I swear Xfinity really be having outages every 5 seconds
1290919429338005505 2020-08-05 03:55:50 EDT <lukawallyz> Feel like shit rn thanks to shit xfinity for ur shit outage -n
1290915898547744768 2020-08-05 03:41:48 EDT <uLoveLucy_> Xfinity would have an outage tight now
1290897722699120640 2020-08-05 02:29:35 EDT <Mr_LiqHerDown> @Xfinity y‚Äôall gotta chill with the outages. You turned mine off for no reason
1290893462850678785 2020-08-05 02:12:39 EDT <_rodgonzalez> Why am I paying the bill if y‚Äôall having power outages?? @Xfinity
1290886804896268288 2020-08-05 01:46:12 EDT <Pentaghastss> @Xfinity a whole six hour outage in Houston (Specifically the heart of Houston, Kingwood, Missouri City, and so on), what are y‚Äôall doing?
1290885191972651011 2020-08-05 01:39:47 EDT <Marleyday13> They  Just tried to send me a bullshit tweet asking from my account information to look into it. I let their asses have it because they know dam well there is a system outage
1290883917952802816 2020-08-05 01:34:44 EDT <ClemsonAsh06> I‚Äôm just recently new again to @Xfinity after over 10 years with another provider so this is new to me. I understand unexpected outages but ‚Äúroutine maintenance‚Äù? Appreciate the text for when it‚Äôs back but how about before you‚Äôre going to knock it out? Is this a regular thing? ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1290861656055193602 2020-08-05 00:06:16 EDT <Wishfulthnkn21> @Xfinity outage in 06473...says resorted by 3:30AM. I work nights from home and cannot work because of this. How accurate is this ETA?
1290851985109983238 2020-08-04 23:27:50 EDT <richrabino1> @Xfinity get your act together. Network outage keeps going on and on and on.... Fix it already! I don't want my money going for nothing!
1290851021112172544 2020-08-04 23:24:00 EDT <ableraces> Wish we could. There‚Äôs a power outage, but although we have a generator Comcast/xfinity appears to have not!
1290839711523667969 2020-08-04 22:39:04 EDT <sarinarosep> i have power, but Xfinity is having an outage .... cool
1290839210023419904 2020-08-04 22:37:04 EDT <strataxe12> @Xfinity what‚Äôs up with Monroe township NJ outage?  Any timeframe?
1290837335408545797 2020-08-04 22:29:38 EDT <KawhaiiFive_O> Man @Xfinity screwed up my whole night can‚Äôt watch nothing cause of outages jus useless, worse it won‚Äôt be on till 1 in the morning ...
1290836409662808064 2020-08-04 22:25:57 EDT <SheenJustin> Seriously, I've never had an issue with RCN, but so many outages since I've moved into an Xfinity only building üò°üò°
1290834966679625729 2020-08-04 22:20:13 EDT <Jakek114055> @Xfinity hahaha you guys are so bad I can‚Äôt even download your app for the first time so I can check my 24 hour outage because when I log in it kicks me out immediately because ‚Äúno more xfinity service at this address‚Äù I can‚Äôt even change it to my current and it kicks me out smh
1290828892102696960 2020-08-04 21:56:04 EDT <Xfinity> You can keep an eye on the outage through the Xfinity My Account app.
1290828813430120449 2020-08-04 21:55:46 EDT <DimLamer> @Xfinity I haven't had service in 8 1/2 hours. Mobile app says no outage in my area. Can't navigate automated phone system to speak to a human. Help!
1290828622316679168 2020-08-04 21:55:00 EDT <Xfinity> We appreciate the feedback, Jason! You can always send over a DM:  http://xfin.tv/support¬† with your account information to report an outage.
1290828328979574784 2020-08-04 21:53:50 EDT <JFred541> @Xfinity for the amount you charge your customers, why is it so difficult to get support when needed. All I need to do is report an outage but your virtual assistant and telephone system are useless. Why is this not a feature in the app?!
1290826143373971462 2020-08-04 21:45:09 EDT <elle__monique> @Xfinity love saying there‚Äôs no outage at your address but it be a gahdamn outage the next street over & expect it not to affect you
1290825824204201984 2020-08-04 21:43:53 EDT <comcast> Have you checked the Xfinity My Account app? There may be maintenance or an outage occuring in your area. -Gabbie
1290822586197258242 2020-08-04 21:31:01 EDT <_Deppz> I need xfinity to stop having outages in my area
1290822532770267140 2020-08-04 21:30:48 EDT <pmontenegro_> The day @Xfinity chooses to have an outage in my area..... literally RCN would never.
1290818787571359746 2020-08-04 21:15:55 EDT <Tiger99865863> Your app says it cannot connect to modem. How its going to connect when there is outage going on? Provide some technical support than just copy and paste same message to everyone.
1290818501184282624 2020-08-04 21:14:47 EDT <Tiger99865863> Your app says it cannot connect to modem. How its going to connect when there is outage going on? Provide some technical support than just copy and paste same message to everyone.
1290816809868898305 2020-08-04 21:08:04 EDT <JUiCEY_K0UTURE> Why does the app not allow people to report outages @Xfinity ?  It says there's no outage in my area but I've spoken to my neighbors who also all lost service at the same time over an hour ago.
1290815611321319425 2020-08-04 21:03:18 EDT <mjandrejko> Your app is notoriously slow in recognizing service interruptions. I‚Äôve been without internet and TV for more than three hours. Tried reporting through the app and got text back telling me there is no outage. Messaged ComcastCares but no response so not sure about the cares part.
1290814048838266882 2020-08-04 20:57:06 EDT <Tiger99865863> @Xfinity is there an Internet outage in North metro Atlanta?
1290813589020913664 2020-08-04 20:55:16 EDT <Charlo_Napper> @Xfinity How long will the outage last?
1290812894821724161 2020-08-04 20:52:30 EDT <bluebird1059> An hour after it went out and NOW there's a notification on my account that there's a service outage. Y'all I am so exhausted.
1290811868353900544 2020-08-04 20:48:26 EDT <mjandrejko> @Xfinity can‚Äôt seem to report my outage. Your system says there is no outage. I had service until 610pm and the Tv screen froze and internet dropped. Couldn‚Äôt report through website and Comcast cares doesn‚Äôt seem to care.
1290805884130430976 2020-08-04 20:24:39 EDT <starinthereads> I pay for Comcast and it's a waste of money. They have too many outages and my box has problems. plus my bill went from 88 dollars to 127 dollars in matters of months. Being with the cable provider off and on since 2009 I don't really think it's worth it.
1290804658026553347 2020-08-04 20:19:47 EDT <AminahRasheed1> Checked it several times today since this issue has been happening since 8am and no outages. So called scheduled maintenance
1290802931948822534 2020-08-04 20:12:55 EDT <mattygoldfarb> @Xfinity been over an hour without a WiFi connection... no outages reported in my area. I cannot get a human on the phone. What is going on here?!?
1290802928156946432 2020-08-04 20:12:54 EDT <storytellinnick> Xfinity has had so many outages and hasn't credited any accounts
1290801998623838210 2020-08-04 20:09:13 EDT <Xfinity> Check the Xfinity My Account app or the Xfinity Status Center:  https://xfin.tv/33xVTUt¬† for outage or maintenance information.
1290795288488222722 2020-08-04 19:42:33 EDT <okdiannaa> this xfinity outage is driving me crazy their internet SUCKS.
1290794287416987649 2020-08-04 19:38:34 EDT <davythejedi> Same. Xfinity is having outages
1290790217771778053 2020-08-04 19:22:24 EDT <Caitlinnnnxo> You know what I love? My power coming back from a tropical storm just to have an xfinity outage. I have a final project due in three days I don‚Äôt have time for this
1290785849672597504 2020-08-04 19:05:02 EDT <DimLamer> @Xfinity your outage map says I'm not effected but I haven't had service in nearly 6 hours. 30 minute hold time on phone. Help?
1290781103234654210 2020-08-04 18:46:11 EDT <alexsalt_> @Xfinity for the past week my wifi has been losing connection. Today it loses connection every five minutes so I can stream anything or play the PS4. I pay for the fastest wifi service available and this is what I get? There's zero outages in my area.
1290775999714603009 2020-08-04 18:25:54 EDT <brianicolee_> @Xfinity why would y‚Äôall upgrade services, during people‚Äôs business hours. This is inconvenient for us whom depend heavily on your services to work. In the middle of teaching my class, you create an outage. Knowing most of us are working from home during this time. üòí FIX THIS!
1290765119123795968 2020-08-04 17:42:40 EDT <Patontheback3> Is anyone else with Xfinity having an outage issue? No internet for the last 2 hours, I wanna scream
1290760034738200577 2020-08-04 17:22:28 EDT <Nico6Preserves> @Xfinity Hey, I‚Äôm at my sister‚Äôs in Frederick, MD while she is out of town. The internet went out-but I can‚Äôt access your outage map since it‚Äôs not my account. Can you confirm if there is an outage on your end?
1290758648520757249 2020-08-04 17:16:57 EDT <Erica_Barker12> @Xfinity how can we actually talk to a human being? Your website is reporting that there are no outages in my area... then why have I not had WiFi for three hours. I‚Äôve reset my router many times to no avail.
1290751913630273536 2020-08-04 16:50:11 EDT <winemomjill> Leave it to Xfinity to make it exceedingly difficult to find out if there is an outage in your area. Log into your account, click 30 times, get logged out, start all over. Like can you not just have a map online?
1290750825934000131 2020-08-04 16:45:52 EDT <ComcastPhillyNJ> Download the @XFINITY My Account app to stay up-to-speed on potential outages in your area. Note: If your power goes out, your local utility provider must restore power before Xfinity technicians can safely start work to restore services. To learn more:  https://comca.st/30sN10r¬†
1290749917032411136 2020-08-04 16:42:15 EDT <SaimanLam> Literally had an outage 20 minutes into my lecture and had to cancel class. Was told it would be resolved hours later. One of the reason why I'm impatiently waiting for @ATT to get their Fiber to me. I miss it so much.
1290743694149275648 2020-08-04 16:17:32 EDT <n1babyfoxtrot> My @Xfinity outage map has the chicken pox...  pic.twitter.com/KTnAvLZfp8
1290742515340062720 2020-08-04 16:12:51 EDT <PikaChulita> Today is just.. not my day lol. Between an Xfinity outage, one of my cats being sick, & then me accidentally resetting my surge protector that sits underneath my desk, amongst so many other things.. I'm ready to scream. I just want to sleep until tomorrow.
1290734663544299520 2020-08-04 15:41:39 EDT <Xfinity> Could be the result of an issue in your area. Have you checked your Xfinity My Account app to see if there is an outage reported?
1290732777307082753 2020-08-04 15:34:09 EDT <GoDownSwingin> It wasn't an outage issue, something in your system defaulted back to the no current broadcast, schedule of upcoming events display.  No other channels had a problem and other providers did the same thing.
1290727401123647492 2020-08-04 15:12:47 EDT <Fussbus1> @Xfinity Why is there no notification option or warning given to customers prior to "regularly scheduled maintenance"?   You can do this, but choose not to.   It is frankly absurd that I cannot receive warning on planned outages, but can receive them when service is restored.
1290715959808974849 2020-08-04 14:27:19 EDT <22_bigal> Yes Che led it and says no outages at my address

1290705534707007489 2020-08-04 13:45:54 EDT <StyxOnYouTube> your internet is fucking dogs hit please fix it i am getting packet loss and lagging i lagged out in a major tournament was in first then i got an outage thanks to you!!!
1290701257078865920 2020-08-04 13:28:54 EDT <li_bolt> Why do you guys always have outages smh
1290699079727681536 2020-08-04 13:20:15 EDT <chgobuckeyegirl> I'm in Chicago.  Xfinity and AT&T own the internet market here.  They are both having issues and have suckass coverage.  During e-learning, our kids got kicked out of zoom numerous times due to outages.
1290698909246017544 2020-08-04 13:19:34 EDT <sgo_kai> Yes there‚Äôs no outage.... also even when the internet is working I will end up randomly lagging or getting packet loss and I‚Äôm paying for a business line so this is ridiculous..... don‚Äôt wanna have to switch to att
1290697588824510467 2020-08-04 13:14:19 EDT <Xfinity> If you are having trouble getting through on the phone, our support team is always here to help. You can use this link:  https://xfin.tv/support¬† and support can look into these recurring outages for you.
1290696836701990917 2020-08-04 13:11:20 EDT <Xfinity> Oh no! Does the My Account app list an area outage?
1290692565927419906 2020-08-04 12:54:22 EDT <KodaSB> Another internet outage? @Xfinity, you shouldn‚Äôt have üò©
1290692223743467520 2020-08-04 12:53:00 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked your Xfinity My Account app to see if there's an outage reported in your area?
1290690414509514753 2020-08-04 12:45:49 EDT <Xfinity> Hey. The Xfinity My Account app will provide details of any area outages, so be sure to check there.
1290689820881309698 2020-08-04 12:43:27 EDT <Dirt_tracklover> @Xfinity are you experiencing outages anywhere in the Northwest part of PA? My internet went down 20 minutes ago. My cable came back 5 minutes ago but no internet still
1290689397076176896 2020-08-04 12:41:46 EDT <Alexei_Segall> Issue 4: not only am I working to support myself but I am also studying for the bar exam. An unwarned outage can ruin my life.
1290689243400953858 2020-08-04 12:41:10 EDT <Contizyy> youtube still works on my tv so its not an outage
1290689153961779201 2020-08-04 12:40:48 EDT <Alexei_Segall> Issue 2: it is only when a user has to go find out through the app that there is a service issue in the area  Issue 3: it takes 30 minutes to get through the automated system just to talk to someone about your bill. There has been outages Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Tuesday
1290689107488899072 2020-08-04 12:40:37 EDT <Joeybagssss> I‚Äôm trying but @Xfinity has had 10+ outages in my area the last 2 days ü§£ Carpe the services!
1290688964047908868 2020-08-04 12:40:03 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked your My Account app to see if you're in an area outage?
1290688767087521793 2020-08-04 12:39:16 EDT <Alexei_Segall> Well that brings us to a list of issues: 1) why does @Xfinity not pre-warn users about service area outages. If they know they are coming don‚Äôt let thousands of people who are working from home detrimentally rely on good internet?
1290687499258535936 2020-08-04 12:34:14 EDT <MaseAgentX> They keep having outages
1290687375216082953 2020-08-04 12:33:44 EDT <novacxnx> @Xfinity okay now y‚Äôall tripping with these outages üòí
1290684168846934022 2020-08-04 12:21:00 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Darren. Is an area service outage listed on the My Account app?
1290683905163636736 2020-08-04 12:19:57 EDT <lilgautama> There isn‚Äôt an internet outage, but there is? Xfinity needs to get it together. I haven‚Äôt had this big of an issue with them in years. I‚Äôve now spoken with 5 reps smh.
1290680916524904448 2020-08-04 12:08:04 EDT <Xfinity> Hey. If you're in an area outage, keep an eye on your Xfinity My Account app or sign up for text alerts to stay updated!
1290678060820443137 2020-08-04 11:56:43 EDT <cnsmith1979> YES!!  But it is every day!!  People are working from home, me included, but I‚Äôm going to lose my job because every single day, multiple times a day, there are outages and I can not work. It is ridiculous. And you can‚Äôt call and speak to someone.
1290677539254476801 2020-08-04 11:54:39 EDT <Xfinity> Are these reported as area outages when you check your Xfinity My Account app?
1290676056920395777 2020-08-04 11:48:46 EDT <Alexei_Segall> @Xfinity @comcast there‚Äôs an outage in internet services at least 7 days a month in the 33050 zip code. Please do better. People‚Äôs jobs and in turn their livelihoods are at stake.
1290675536847605762 2020-08-04 11:46:42 EDT <i_amreefa> There is an internet outage that has been going on since this morning! I need a credit this is hindering me from doing my job üó£üó£ I also need a credit as well this is the 2nd outage I‚Äôve experienced
1290674985669992448 2020-08-04 11:44:30 EDT <cnsmith1979> @xfinity WTF is going on??  Every single day there are several outages disrupting internet usage. EVERY DAY!!  No customer service!!  This is ridiculous!!
1290667300064882695 2020-08-04 11:13:58 EDT <theladyterror> First outage with Xfinity 144 days after starting to WFH. Terribly inconvenient but I guess I can't be too mad with the streak.  pic.twitter.com/ZgYJN9mRNX
1290664952789860354 2020-08-04 11:04:38 EDT <JustLetMe_Sleep> Hey @Xfinity since you keep track of when I am having an outage, why won't your website give me a credit for all the time I have been without internet this month?
1290664012544442368 2020-08-04 11:00:54 EDT <JustLetMe_Sleep> Xfinity: Good news, customer! We can confirm that you are, in fact, having an outage. :D
1290659806387339264 2020-08-04 10:44:11 EDT <Xfinity> You can always check your My Account app for info on possible outages.
1290658321662447616 2020-08-04 10:38:17 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Andrea. Does the Xfinity My Account app list a service outage in the area?
1290638435011657729 2020-08-04 09:19:16 EDT <WrightRealtor1> It says my modem is off line (it‚Äôs not I unplugged and plugged it in three times). The map shows an outage in my area affecting up to 500 homes. I FINALLY found a number to call( not on your website ) and I am waiting a callback which could be between 44-65 minutes 1/2
1290627814580944897 2020-08-04 08:37:04 EDT <dandaly71> @Xfinity.  We have had an outage everyday since June 27.    What are you going to do about this?   About to switch back to AT&T.   Chamblee -Tucker area.  Georgia
1290621740398399491 2020-08-04 08:12:56 EDT <fbarrott36> @Xfinity no internet in Berrian Springs Mi.  Are there outages?  Lights are just dancing on router box
1290616348696096769 2020-08-04 07:51:30 EDT <claw1400> How exactly is their an outage in my entire complex, the estimated fix time gets delayed five times through yesterday and into this morning, and then magically the problem is because my cables and wires aren‚Äôt tight enough? This is unreal. (cc: @Xfinity/@Comcast/@ComcastCares)
1290610746532012038 2020-08-04 07:29:15 EDT <claw1400> Uh, hey @Xfinity/@Comcast, you good? Now, apparently no outages in the area? My internet/cable/voice are all still showing as not connected on my profile. Try tightening all of my connections? Try fixing your damn service. (cc: @ComcastCares) pic.twitter.com/xzijb2io4Y

Resolved by Saturday, by Sunday morning, afternoon, evening, and night. Now Monday morning, afternoon, evening and night. It‚Äôs beginning to look a lot like my street switching to @Xfinity.  pic.twitter.com/uTvZxxwMam

1290405542553366531 2020-08-03 17:53:50 EDT <HtownShan> @Xfinity When you have "scheduled outages," it would be helpful if you let us know. This would be very helpful since I'm working from home.

1290375263537238017 2020-08-03 15:53:31 EDT <Xfinity> You can check your Xfinity My Account app to see if there's an outage reported in your area.
1290369411644366849 2020-08-03 15:30:16 EDT <jamdraper> Does anyone else have problems with at least one Xfinity outage that lasts 6+ hours nearly each month?
1290368811158212608 2020-08-03 15:27:53 EDT <imorynwins> Well I‚Äôm officially on the 4th-5th @comcast @Xfinity internet outage within a week. Literally the worst company ever. Customer service just tells you they can‚Äôt do anything about it. I wish there were more options for service providers in my area.
1290367742160392192 2020-08-03 15:23:38 EDT <Xsore23> Gonna have to rebroadcast in a little while. @Xfinity has detected another outage in my area for the 6th time in a month. Idk what keeps happening that's causing outages so frequently in the past couple weeks.
1290363365613645824 2020-08-03 15:06:14 EDT <btr_ng> @Xfinity why is there always an outage i can‚Äôt believe i pay $70 a month for shitty internet and tv service
1290351178010812417 2020-08-03 14:17:49 EDT <silentdevops> @Xfinity decides to have an outage the day my staycation begins.. so much for catching up on the flix and gaming üòí
1290337572623921155 2020-08-03 13:23:45 EDT <InTheBleachers> haha, it is something, along with voice command that i think xfinity as has done really well. but don't get me started on the random volume outages
1290335160664301571 2020-08-03 13:14:10 EDT <Bromoish> Oh look another @Xfinity outage.  pic.twitter.com/DeiSCoMdLU
1290334332956090370 2020-08-03 13:10:52 EDT <Ebbi_Lena> @Xfinity Can y‚Äôall please give me an outage at my address so i can lay down, zip: 33311 ‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è #workingfromhome.
1290327156619345926 2020-08-03 12:42:21 EDT <mslisaaa_> Um so has Xfinity released a statement? It‚Äôs a fucking outage and I‚Äôm trying to work .
1290326788082511878 2020-08-03 12:40:54 EDT <MsVillEeee> You guys constantly have outages. All the time. Working and schooling from home has been a mess because of this. I highly doubt there is anything you can do to fix this.
1290325304158953473 2020-08-03 12:35:00 EDT <MYERSinMS> @comcastcares @Xfinity this is the 8th day in the past 2 weeks we‚Äôve had an outage. I‚Äôm about to reluctantly switch to @ATT or @CSpire. My neighbors are all about to do the same. Yes, you put a credit on my bill, but that doesn‚Äôt help me be productive working from home. pic.twitter.com/x6a7dhHQRz
1290320820695261189 2020-08-03 12:17:11 EDT <bts_ynwa061313> WiFi and no outages or issues reported in my area other than xfinity internet going down every couple of seconds for an extended period of time
1290310494163595265 2020-08-03 11:36:09 EDT <MrsBieb83659899> @Xfinity please improve connectivity in eastern Washington! I‚Äôve been having intermittent internet outages the last 2 weeks making it extremely difficult to work. When I call support I get the same song & dance w/ no fix I can‚Äôt keep paying you $200/month for this!
1290298805959573506 2020-08-03 10:49:42 EDT <Xfinity> Are you in an area outage?
1290292970193743872 2020-08-03 10:26:31 EDT <eyesupfeetmovin> @xfinity have the most outages in my area... i need a discount scrap
1290287882918273025 2020-08-03 10:06:18 EDT <Mrs_VictoriaArd> @Xfinity Why is there an outage weekly in my neighborhood? Why am I paying for service I can‚Äôt use?? üôÑ
1290282021747593217 2020-08-03 09:43:00 EDT <TLynn419> Having another outage are we @Xfinity
1290223143198621696 2020-08-03 05:49:03 EDT <BluesNewsBatman> Outage yeaterday, we were out of town, neighbors said internet was flaky all weekend. Our power also went out, tree went down a few houses away and took everything out.  Apparently the two werent related!  They are crap. Stupid Monopoly.
1290206413973622785 2020-08-03 04:42:34 EDT <Roglo_> @Xfinity  have my fucking credit on my next bill ready. Cable and WiFi outage until 6am wtf
1290140650311045121 2020-08-03 00:21:15 EDT <50shadesofuckyu> So xfinity decides to do routine maintenance which means a temporary outage until 9 am cause it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm working on a paper at the moment or work from damn home at 6 am üòëüò§
1290085958025482241 2020-08-02 20:43:55 EDT <WolfgalVlad> Ngl I'd expect it to be the other way around or at least be the same.. guess I'm wrong üòì  Hope your outage won't last a fricking day
1290076071912562688 2020-08-02 20:04:38 EDT <WhosJor_> @Xfinity why has there been constant internet outages in my area for 4 days ü•∫
1290008265498095617 2020-08-02 15:35:12 EDT <BlakeDobyns> Your stupid contracts make it so you can only watch the blazer game on NBCNW in our area. And now there‚Äôs a service outage in our area right before tip off. You guys are BIG trash @Xfinity
1289996907025031169 2020-08-02 14:50:04 EDT <Rustynoobs> @Xfinity you having outages in Katy, TX? We can't get ahold of your support via phone or livechat either.
1289970622563483648 2020-08-02 13:05:37 EDT <Xfinity> Hi! We wanted to check in to see if you still need help with the service interruption you mentioned yesterday. Our Xfinity My Account app is always available to provide details about any outages in your area including the estimated time to repair or try  https://xfin.tv/status¬†.
1289968586522415104 2020-08-02 12:57:32 EDT <ProfLHunter> Hey @comcast_shares ‚Äî my xfinity 100Mb/s service has been up and down (and sometimes just very slow) for days.   I‚Äôm in Denver, CO 80230.  Reset modem several times, etc.  Your web site claims no outages.  What‚Äôs up???
1289964775099650049 2020-08-02 12:42:23 EDT <Jontaylor_1> What‚Äôs going on with the outages @Xfinity
1289960336125243393 2020-08-02 12:24:45 EDT <j_farmer04> @CenturyLinkHelp @CenturyLink this outage in Fort Myers is persisting forever! What‚Äôs the deal? @Xfinity you have any good internet deals?
1289928400002379776 2020-08-02 10:17:50 EDT <Eilonwy79> @comcastcares What is with all of the sporadic outages in NE DC this weekend? Lost Xfinity service at least twice yesterday and now twice so far again today. Clear skies with no heavy wind. As far as I can tell from the Xfinity account app, these outages weren‚Äôt scheduled.
1289804314232274944 2020-08-02 02:04:46 EDT <NormRhodes> 3 times in 48 hours...thanks @Xfinity for all of your outages at the worst times.
1289774258743197696 2020-08-02 00:05:20 EDT <HarleyMitchy> @Xfinity @comcastcares Another week. Another outage. So glad I get to pay to not have service.
1289759327423614977 2020-08-01 23:06:00 EDT <vhalio85> Every day for the past month there has been an @Xfinity outage. WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON? AND WHY AM I PAYING ALL THIS MONEY?
1289743331975520256 2020-08-01 22:02:27 EDT <atty_dani> Xfinity has been going down every damn day making WFH impossible so now they decided 7-11 pm on Saturday is the best outage time ü•¥
1289696906541580291 2020-08-01 18:57:58 EDT <Kieran03609555> Worst service ever!!! I had 4 outages in my area in less than a month. And currently on the phone for hours with the worst customer service trying to ‚Äòtroubleshoot‚Äô which hasn‚Äôt worked like the THIRD time!!
1289674550481833984 2020-08-01 17:29:08 EDT <DigitallyBorn> @Xfinity Twice this week I‚Äôve reported an outage. Twice I got this text message. Twice there was an outage. You‚Äôre doing this on purpose, aren‚Äôt you?  pic.twitter.com/ifFADZApsp
1289667208377901056 2020-08-01 16:59:57 EDT <RegalLy_Royal> This Xfinity outage is really fucking up my Saturday
1289535887030865921 2020-08-01 08:18:08 EDT <VinCProhairart> @comcast @Xfinity has been giving me trouble all week with TV and internet. It always says there‚Äôs outages in my are. Trying to figure out what‚Äôs going on but not easy.
1289463210781769729 2020-08-01 03:29:21 EDT <ComoSeDiceAndy> Xfinity outage we love it
1289456290972839937 2020-08-01 03:01:51 EDT <SantilliPlayz> Internet outage , Xfinity claims won‚Äôt be on until 3:30amü•∫
1289443641384030208 2020-08-01 02:11:35 EDT <Peacefuldog> @comcastcares @Xfinity this #outage really sucks  pic.twitter.com/WGPmkWtzgt
1289434360815341569 2020-08-01 01:34:42 EDT <The_MrMoose> The outage only affected Comcast customers, so it's a Comcast issue.
1289433092931743744 2020-08-01 01:29:40 EDT <Peacefuldog> @comcastcares @xfinity Great, not only do we have an outage but now you‚Äôve said it will last even longer? WTH?  pic.twitter.com/rnMnMmMNxS
1289427550016438272 2020-08-01 01:07:38 EDT <Peacefuldog> @Xfinity @comcastcares Well, this sucks #outage #xfinityoutage pic.twitter.com/L8D1gZh3JJ
1289426748564635648 2020-08-01 01:04:27 EDT <FiddyCentChi> Paying over $100 and really enjoying my almost nightly service outages. Y'all are killing it over at @Xfinity.
1289419638917365760 2020-08-01 00:36:12 EDT <DM59631271> Completely agree @Xfinity has caused me nothing but headaches with constant outages for both internet and cable... and a customer service team that doesn‚Äôt care about getting to the root cause.
1289404098605793280 2020-07-31 23:34:27 EDT <_jwash_> @Xfinity what‚Äôs going on with the internet? 4 outages this week.
1289396722079326208 2020-07-31 23:05:09 EDT <sugablaze> Seriously maybe @GOP and @SenateDems  should be not only focusing on tech companies but also focus more on Xfinity. Blanket service outages for several days. I'm sure people should be expecting refunds. Or the @bbb_us needs to get involved.
1289395063714283521 2020-07-31 22:58:33 EDT <BettyBolte> @comcast @Xfinity takes our money but gives pixelated service. For a year now but due to their ‚Äúpolicies‚Äù they won‚Äôt fix it because it‚Äôs not an outage. They can‚Äôt bother to put on a mask and come into our front yard to check the outside lines? Really?! Who is in charge there?
1289393774171316225 2020-07-31 22:53:26 EDT <sugablaze> @comcastcares hey Xfinity seems to be down. According to your app there's an outage of 51,000+ in my area. And it won't be back up until tomorrow. I work from home and obviously I need service or I can't do my job which means I don't get paid. Please look into this issue.
1289391255697285122 2020-07-31 22:43:25 EDT <EmbersFromAshes> .@Xfinity @Comcast This is at least the 4th time in July that you've had an @MSNBC outage of significant duration. Seems to last between 8-12 hours each time. This time it's 2 days in a row! Am in the 94509 zip code & pay an obscene amount of $ for service. I want my MSNBC shows!
1289381584655626240 2020-07-31 22:04:59 EDT <_whitfin> Nearing 12 hour @Xfinity internet outage, great when working remote üôÉ
1289362688921833472 2020-07-31 20:49:54 EDT <TryCatchPass> No time like the middle of a couple live streaming events you're running for an hour long (and counting) @Xfinity outage
1289362248394186752 2020-07-31 20:48:09 EDT <levaagrace> @Xfinity my area has had an inordinate amount of internet, tv, and phone outages for months now. Clearly whatever you‚Äôre doing to patch it ISN‚ÄôT WORKING. Thanks.
1289355224138813441 2020-07-31 20:20:15 EDT <Island_Exposure> @Xfinity  You people are a joke. We have had an outage in our area since 6 a.m. this morning. You have missed multiple deadlines that you have set to repair it. The latest is 11 p.m. tonight. I doubt you're going to make that deadline as well. Hate Comcast!
1289286292451151874 2020-07-31 15:46:20 EDT <CScavar> So my xfinity app says there are no outages in my area, and then immediately lists my zip code as having an outage. cool #comcastoutage
1289280198030946304 2020-07-31 15:22:07 EDT <mauralin> We have wave g bc they didn‚Äôt make us sign a contract and we can use our own equipment (haven‚Äôt hooked up ours tho... oops) but it seems to be fine ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è fewer outages than xfinity at our last place for sure
1289279900629770242 2020-07-31 15:20:56 EDT <slsjr1> Yes, but It's ridiculous that you have to have 1,200 self-check modems before you can talk to a person when you know the outage is not on your side!
1289275853302456320 2020-07-31 15:04:51 EDT <Joeybagssss> @Xfinity why can I never have consistent internet connections and speeds from y‚Äôall? Service outage earlier in the week and now I lose connection every 8 minutes.
1289271697560834048 2020-07-31 14:48:20 EDT <haleyharshaw> @comcast @Xfinity @comcastcares these internet outages/maintenance in the middle of the day for the past few days are NOT conducive to those of us working from home. Find a solution to this problem. Quickly.
1289271526504587264 2020-07-31 14:47:40 EDT <Xfinity> Be sure to check the My Account app throughout the duration of the outage for updates. Hopefully it's restored before 5!
1289263446974820352 2020-07-31 14:15:33 EDT <Xfinity> Are you in an area outage?
1289254639213322240 2020-07-31 13:40:33 EDT <Dfresh1105> Ever since a scheduled outage the other day my Wi-Fi speeds are horrible in my Internet connection keeps going up and down. My wife and I both work from home so this is not convenient. And trying to get in touch with somebody who can help us get this taken care of has been crap
1289250403838644224 2020-07-31 13:23:44 EDT <steven_nelson> Per NextDoor reports, it's an ongoing problem in multiple adjacent neighborhoods, with multiple daily brief outages. Calls to support are treated like isolated individual problems rather than acknowledged as a widespread problem in the area. @Xfinity @comcastcares
1289246076311044097 2020-07-31 13:06:32 EDT <reyd1701> @comcast @Xfinity YOUR AUTOMATED SYSTEM IS THE WORSE! Our internet and tv has been out since last night due to an outage. Trying to get someone on the to get a credit since U are down! But ur system is the absolute worse!!
1289236552221040645 2020-07-31 12:28:41 EDT <ssjdez> Nah I swear. Had an outage 2 times this week already. And Xfinity is the only good WiFi I can get in my area smh
1289236088121303040 2020-07-31 12:26:50 EDT <DubDeezz> @Xfinity Are you going to warn us at least one time that you are ‚Äúperforming maintenance‚Äù and that there‚Äôs going to be an hour long outage? Ever? Seems like everytime it‚Äôs a total surprise
1289233837868761090 2020-07-31 12:17:54 EDT <DontBePoorGirl> I have xfinity.. faster.. only problem is their outages here & there but when it works , it works
1289215173807370240 2020-07-31 11:03:44 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Richard. Have you checked your My Account app to see if there's an outage reported in your area?
1289205419127136256 2020-07-31 10:24:58 EDT <Xfinity> We understand the outages are frustrating. Continue to check the My Accountapp throughout the outage as you have been doing.
1289205414651768838 2020-07-31 10:24:57 EDT <DeliberateAspen> @Xfinity so now you update us, internet outage extended from 930ish am to now 130pm? I better be getting credit for this.
1289205376785584130 2020-07-31 10:24:48 EDT <Xfinity> We apologize for this continuous occurrence. We're working to fix this ASAP. If you want to talk about possible credits due to these outages, send us a DM here:  https://xfin.tv/support¬† , with your account info.
1289195176519294981 2020-07-31 09:44:16 EDT <Xfinity> When these outages occur are there any notifications for you about the status of your services in the My Account app? Also, how far are your devices from the gateway, and is this happening for more than one device?
1289192707886321664 2020-07-31 09:34:28 EDT <Xfinity> Hi, When these outages occur are there any notifications for you about the status of your services in the My Account app?
1289192381187854336 2020-07-31 09:33:10 EDT <Xfinity> Hey, Eroll. When these outages occur are there any notifications for you about the status of your services in the My Account app?

Thankfully @TMobile hotspot got me back up & running, but that isn‚Äôt always reliable at home. Do better #xfinity. We pay too much for this.  https://twitter.com/adamkstout/status/1288353888807145472¬†‚Ä¶

1289022849492168704 2020-07-30 22:19:30 EDT <joonbuggin> So y‚Äôall have been having an outage for 2-3 days?
1289022003584864256 2020-07-30 22:16:09 EDT <_itszie> When there's an internet/cable outage (for several hours already) literally only at your apartment complex. The fuck, cool. Guess I just go to bed lol? #Xfinity #Comcast
1289012333281509376 2020-07-30 21:37:43 EDT <_jreylo> So there‚Äôs an outage in my area for xfinity.... esimated time for it to be fix? 1 am üòí WiFi has been out since 8 so why would it take 4 hours to fix?
1289010128604274689 2020-07-30 21:28:57 EDT <Xfinity> Hey Ash. You're having issues with your WiFi - did you check the Xfinity My Account app to see if there was maintenance or an outage in the area?
1289008965263687684 2020-07-30 21:24:20 EDT <GurlPwr4Life> A week doesn‚Äôt go by without an #xfinity outage
1288964329421918208 2020-07-30 18:26:58 EDT <QisKING4> My service is awful. We're working from home and the internet goes in and out everyday, Allday... And there is always an outage in the area. Its time for a change.  Xfinity USE to be pretty reliable. Not anymore...üòî
1288961118359007232 2020-07-30 18:14:13 EDT <BalanceNegative> The inability to see local outages without having to log into your account, only to deal with the dreadful layout of your website that continually reloads for some reason and I am NEVER able to access anything that I need to access.  2/2
1288954268930760705 2020-07-30 17:46:59 EDT <sdlovesummer88> Xfinity. Finally got a hold of them! As soon as I typed in pass. Outage in the area so I got partial refund back good enough.
1288952972995702785 2020-07-30 17:41:51 EDT <ausisout> How you gonna have an internet outage in a county you have a monopoly in @Xfinity ??????  pic.twitter.com/OVG9CdmuM3
1288952792107950083 2020-07-30 17:41:07 EDT <King__Jasmine> Xfinity get your shit together with this outage. ü§¨
1288946445807222786 2020-07-30 17:15:54 EDT <Energize_OW> Yes, 90% of the time there isn't an outage.
1288932439239393280 2020-07-30 16:20:15 EDT <ayyyemal> Xfinity has a service outage rn fml
1288930354896805888 2020-07-30 16:11:58 EDT <Techylane1> @comcastcares @Xfinity Is this your gamer grade internet??? service reps keep have said "there's an outage in your area" for weeks and nothing changes while my neighbors pull 200mbps download speeds and 40mbps uploads. I keep getting kicked from my @PlayVALORANT games. pic.twitter.com/tIuxlWXjvN
1288930287485952000 2020-07-30 16:11:42 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked the My Account app for outages in your area?
1288915513985454086 2020-07-30 15:13:00 EDT <adiw1202> I upgraded my Xfinity TV box and router to the latest early this year at no cost. I very rarely have an outage since then. The old boxes were bad.
1288915376697311232 2020-07-30 15:12:27 EDT <kskaran94> @Xfinity Two outages in 3 days. Great work ! It's not that all of us are dependent on it for our lives and livelihood !(94043, Mountain view)  @ATT Please we need your fibre
1288913993042726912 2020-07-30 15:06:57 EDT <MeatyFrags> Yes, and there is an outage in my zip code somewhere but not at my address. I lose signal daily and have had my modem tested and talked to your customer service. This is a reoccurring problem.
1288913510601293835 2020-07-30 15:05:02 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked the Xfinity My Account app for outage info?
1288907554513444864 2020-07-30 14:41:22 EDT <Kazisanwar> Not today you‚Äôre not. Outage for the last 4.5 hrs. Not getting any work done.
1288905239618375680 2020-07-30 14:32:10 EDT <Xfinity> You can check for outage info in the Xfinity My Account app.
1288904610208526336 2020-07-30 14:29:40 EDT <forevrblushing> Are y‚Äôall having an outage or something? @Xfinity

1288884692926836743 2020-07-30 13:10:31 EDT <jasonnocks> Another day, another @Xfinity outage. I've lost count of the outages in my area this month. Pretty sure it's at least 5. None severe weather related. #xfinityoutage #xfinityisajoke #seekingalternatives pic.twitter.com/0gB0AVHQMz
1288883772562313216 2020-07-30 13:06:52 EDT <_paperplaneJANE> @Xfinity THIS ISSUE BETTER BE RESOLVED BEFORE THE NBA GAMES START.   y‚Äôall are garbage. And we better get outage credits for this bullshit.
1288857560527888385 2020-07-30 11:22:42 EDT <Chelseaafrench> Thanks @Xfinity for an Internet outage when I need it to work from home and continuously pushing back the restore time. No storms or reason there should be an issue and can‚Äôt do anything.
1288857295796011009 2020-07-30 11:21:39 EDT <SycogenesisTTV> 2 outages back to back day after day @Xfinity  pic.twitter.com/XurjgHWU4h

1288842338941501440 2020-07-30 10:22:13 EDT <Chappy4214> Multiple people in the neighborhood had reported issues all this week and last week. I had a 5min outage for no reason about an hour ago. I pay for like 500mb down and my upload can‚Äôt even hit 10mb.   I had to switch off your modem/router to just get close to speeds I pay for!
1288811734107471873 2020-07-30 08:20:37 EDT <GentleGraham> Sorry everyone for the technical details, guess Xfinity had some internet outages last night of which killed us.
1288781567821852674 2020-07-30 06:20:44 EDT <DonniDOMINrican> Waking up to another @Xfinity outage and me having to work in 30 mins  pic.twitter.com/leuNMv1R4Z
1288760425689972736 2020-07-30 04:56:44 EDT <MattHerbst_> It would be nice to get advanced notice of planned outages @Xfinity @comcastcares though it's ridiculous that there is a six hour planned outage in the first place  pic.twitter.com/33gQgqpnce
1288760058122080256 2020-07-30 04:55:16 EDT <Sao_Ali> Can‚Äôt download a book because Xfinity want to have an outage
1288738730891673601 2020-07-30 03:30:31 EDT <bluntme22iah> Despite Xfinity going down due to an outage, I managed to finish most of the panels for this week's upload.  @Xfinity fix your internet! It's been wonky all week!
1288737832593321984 2020-07-30 03:26:57 EDT <MiladMoghimi1> xfinity deadass be having multiple hour long outages like once a week at this point wtf
1288735671721570304 2020-07-30 03:18:22 EDT <Vaughn_AJ> @CenturyLink @CenturyLinkHelp please add fiber in my area so I can switch over and dont have to deal with Xfinity outages all the time
1288734562617405440 2020-07-30 03:13:57 EDT <Vaughn_AJ> @Xfinity @comcastcares yay another outage. This time over 4 hours before the estimated fix. #FixYoShit
1288731771006263296 2020-07-30 03:02:52 EDT <JoswaldMata> Hey @Xfinity @comcastcares I barely have a month with the service and I am already in the middle of an outage with ETR 6:00am. This never happened with @RCNconnects in 2 years. What an entrance #xfinity !! Missing #rcn but they confirmed they don‚Äôt cover this area.
1288731388099932160 2020-07-30 03:01:21 EDT <ideeryoubambi> Xfinity is on my hit list. If I want to stream tv at 3 am, then that‚Äôs my prerogative. I hate how they schedule routine maintenance w/o an announcement then we have an outage out of nowhere. Count your days mister mamaz. @Xfinity
1288726272533659650 2020-07-30 02:41:01 EDT <just_cuzzzzzz> I have xfinity as well bro. They rest at 12 some nights to perform maintience/internet outages at your area sometimes. If you download the xfinity app and sign into your account it can tell you if anything is going on at your area
1288725999224586240 2020-07-30 02:39:56 EDT <LKKRISSS> Another night another outage by Xfinity üò°
1288720486948511745 2020-07-30 02:18:02 EDT <QueenChunkers> Literally can‚Äôt even play the update bc I don‚Äôt have WiFi üò¢ @Xfinity for the love of goodness fix the outage! Never one issue with it until you decide to ‚Äúenhance‚Äù it...
1288714113229570050 2020-07-30 01:52:42 EDT <QueenChunkers> Didn‚Äôt work, then it didn‚Äôt work all day again because you were ‚Äúenhancing‚Äù whatever that is and now it‚Äôs an outage. Can‚Äôt even get my toddler to sleep bc the tv doesn‚Äôt work without it. Whyyyy do you have so many issues,Xfinity?
1288696275567812609 2020-07-30 00:41:49 EDT <ZarkMuckerberg0> ‚ÄúOutage in your area, please wait 2-48 hours.‚Äù
1288667266171703297 2020-07-29 22:46:33 EDT <kozathecat> first a massive comcast/xfinity outage yesterday and now a spectrum outage today? sus
1288662212379320325 2020-07-29 22:26:28 EDT <SparkSeekerrr> It‚Äôs the same with @Xfinity every week huge outage smack in the middle of the day, usually while I‚Äôm presenting in a meeting.
1288658967703498752 2020-07-29 22:13:34 EDT <giotfu> is there an xfinity outage in oviedo? my shit acting up
1288654536647688193 2020-07-29 21:55:58 EDT <paulshawmindset> @Ask_Spectrum ok guys how does one have an outage when no severe weather has occurred... I mean @Xfinity is shit but like it only totally goes out during like blizzards and hurricanes. I miss you in LA @Xfinity
1288652597386240003 2020-07-29 21:48:15 EDT <EGlaskin> Dear @Xfinity, does 3 out of 4 nights of ‚Äúservice outages in my area‚Äù sound okay to you? I don‚Äôt understand what that means when others in my town have service. Three nights without internet does not allow me to get my job done. Also, do technicians actually know how to fix it?
1288649733314088960 2020-07-29 21:36:53 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked the Xfinity My Account app for outages in your area?
1288631186231824386 2020-07-29 20:23:11 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked the My Account app to see if there was an outage happening in the area?
1288625463645081611 2020-07-29 20:00:26 EDT <fuzzybluejay922> @Xfinity 2nd day in a row at 6pm our cable TV and internet go out... this is getting to be ridiculous. If you are working on lines then you should let customers know to expect outages.
1288607550485782529 2020-07-29 18:49:15 EDT <Xfinity> Is there an outage in the area? Check the Xfinity My Account app for information or troubleshooting help.
1288601590182694916 2020-07-29 18:25:34 EDT <Demon4495> I got a new a newest modem from @Xfinity and it‚Äôs supposed to run 200mbps and only getting 50mbps is there an outage or is it just not working it has been happening for a week now and called about it and couldn‚Äôt do nothing about it
1288596220366249989 2020-07-29 18:04:14 EDT <McDarnit> I use xfinity extreme and pay $80, you just gotta finnesse them into some ‚Äúdeal‚Äù every couple years.  MetroNet (A2 based) thinks I‚Äôm a customer and sends me service reports and they have outages almost every week. Avoid them.
1288579819224141825 2020-07-29 16:59:04 EDT <jasonnocks> Wow @Xfinity, #Outage number 4 in this area for July! Are you kidding? Had more reliable dedicated dialup service in the 90s than your cable modem service. #ExploringAlternatives pic.twitter.com/nJYBtKq9mP
1288578747264716800 2020-07-29 16:54:48 EDT <slumpdaddydiaz> @comcastcares @comcast @Xfinity is there an outage in 93940 zip code?
1288575629516931073 2020-07-29 16:42:25 EDT <Ray_Sturm> Do you live in the city? Haven't had the issue at home with xfinity or at the office (some days I go in) with MonkeyBrains, both in SF. I upgraded the wifi network for better zoom performance but no ISP outages
1288572408908132352 2020-07-29 16:29:37 EDT <forevrblushing> is xfinity having some sort of outage?
1288569792883044353 2020-07-29 16:19:13 EDT <thatguydream> bruh my @Xfinity internet has been trash throughout quarantine, I have never experience this many internet outages within a short period of time! what y‚Äôall got going on man?
1288567566613372928 2020-07-29 16:10:22 EDT <meliton1389> Yes I did, there is an outage in my area. Hope to be resolved soon.
1288567505754046466 2020-07-29 16:10:08 EDT <wdorshow> @comcast / @Xfinity = terrible internet provider. I sure wish we had better options in New Mexico.   "An XFINITY Internet outage has been reported in your area... The issue will be resolved 07/29/2020 06:00 PM (Mountain)." FOUR HOURS? WTF
1288566989024354305 2020-07-29 16:08:05 EDT <williamwinters0> @Xfinity My internet is down. No outage in area. Unplugged and reset multiple times. App says modem not responding.
1288564639886987264 2020-07-29 15:58:45 EDT <_odriscoll95> @Xfinity knows we are the only internet service provider and that I can't switch from them. I've had an outage for 8+ hours the past four days. How am I suppose to work ?  pic.twitter.com/34R0thcTfz
1288563801667694592 2020-07-29 15:55:25 EDT <_Queen_Tings> Xfinity is pissing me tf off like why tf has my internet been off for over 12 hours outages don‚Äôt take that damn long yo fix
1288547801505374210 2020-07-29 14:51:50 EDT <Xfinity> Understood. We are happy to take a look at the frequency of these outages and look into this to see if there is a deeper issue. If you change your mind, please use the link above.
1288547233751867392 2020-07-29 14:49:35 EDT <Khylan7> Another outage. @Xfinity üòê
1288541295204421632 2020-07-29 14:25:59 EDT <DanRMonty> Hey @Xfinity, when multiple residents and administration in an apartment building all are experiencing internet outages at the same time...please don‚Äôt tell me it‚Äôs my modems fault.  pic.twitter.com/gcAOYVzbe5
1288539911075708929 2020-07-29 14:20:29 EDT <Smelvin_Jenkins> @Xfinity is there an outage in West Seattle?
1288536985221697537 2020-07-29 14:08:51 EDT <SixOneSev3n> Hey @ArcticGames03, since @Xfinity decided to be stupid and take our internet down for an outage and their tech is too inept to restore it when they originally said they would, I‚Äôll be on when I can for stream. Thanks xfinity for keeping this streamer from doing his job and
1288535108530720770 2020-07-29 14:01:24 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Lisa. If your My Account app indicates that you're in an area outage, please keep an eye there for updates or sign up for text alerts. Both will provide you with info as it becomes available.
1288535096677433346 2020-07-29 14:01:21 EDT <sram255> @Xfinity having a network outage since yesterday morning in 95123 zip code. It‚Äôs been almost 24 hrs & your update says it will take another 30 hrs. In this pandemic such a poor response is not expected. How are we supposed to WFH? You seem to be driving your loyal customers away.
1288534718368055296 2020-07-29 13:59:51 EDT <toby_fanning> Been there, done that, several times. The problem is not with resolution when there are issues, but with the frequency of issues. A company like yours should have the infrastructure to enable strong wifi connection regularly. Outages every few weeks are unacceptable
1288531740105953280 2020-07-29 13:48:01 EDT <renatiux99> Another day another Internet Outage at home. We have the unlimited plan since last week, don‚Äôt know if that is the reason but what a coincidence that since we cancel the monthly service fee now our service sucks!!! Thanks @Xfinity  https://twitter.com/renatiux99/status/1288291169965752320¬†‚Ä¶
1288530059280687104 2020-07-29 13:41:20 EDT <txbadboyz06> @Xfinity I have tried repeatedly to reach customer service regarding consistent outages of the Internet and cable services only to be disconnected seven times. Do you dare to suggest ‚Äùuse the app‚Äù?  You charge exorbitant prices but provide the worse customer service and products.
1288528652339036160 2020-07-29 13:35:45 EDT <Snailorscout> Love when the internet goes down when trying to work from home and xfinity is like "no there's not an outage dummy ‚ô•"
1288519606177419264 2020-07-29 12:59:48 EDT <supitsjessieee> @Xfinity is there an outage in Seattle? Been down like 20 minutes. Restarted modem and router. Working from home and can‚Äôt work. Lovely #WFHChronicles
1288512255915679745 2020-07-29 12:30:35 EDT <matthew_king175> @comcastcares @Xfinity @comcast Every day this week there has been an outage at the same time. What are you doing? Are you insistent on losing customers?
1288510243262140416 2020-07-29 12:22:36 EDT <colinags> this the second consecutive xfinity outage and almost the exact time.. cmon fam
1288509864583532551 2020-07-29 12:21:05 EDT <kristekarma> How's about you do your job and see if there's a bloody outage instead of arguing with customers? I'm not doing  your job for you. It's a simple yes or no. Outage in 33312, YES OR NO?
1288504004918628352 2020-07-29 11:57:48 EDT <Xfinity> Be sure to check the My Account app or web portal to track your service  and find status updates on any outages. If you have additional concerns let us know.
1288503601569161217 2020-07-29 11:56:12 EDT <Xfinity> Your X1 will not work if your cable goes out. If you're in an area outage, it will usually affect your internet & cable.
1288499000199524359 2020-07-29 11:37:55 EDT <RebeccaTownsend> On Mondqy I upped what I pay @Xfinity @comcast for internet. I ordered a nee modem. Today, there is an outage.  Lovely.
1288493757030191106 2020-07-29 11:17:05 EDT <aeazel> Ack! I can't imagine dealing with it that long. We've had a service outage that was pre-planned, for which I just tethered to my phone for work, but I can't imagine that long during this.
1288493339935997958 2020-07-29 11:15:25 EDT <SelfieTreats> I‚Äôm in 33304 and I‚Äôm dealing with the same. Apparently there is an outage.
1288490937623228421 2020-07-29 11:05:53 EDT <aniyahspops> It's dope how @Xfinity throttles you on your due date.... Is it something they've disclosed and I missed it? Or it's just awesome BIDNESS practices? Educate me please. It doesn't speed up after a random outage. Just looking for clarity. #shittypractice
1288489910865985537 2020-07-29 11:01:48 EDT <kristekarma> @Xfinity Has there been any reported outages in the 33312? Had to restart my modem a few times as the service keeps cutting out.
1288486393992404994 2020-07-29 10:47:49 EDT <Xfinity> We apologize for the constant outages. Let's see what's been going on in your area. Send us a DM here:  https://xfin.tv/support¬† , with your account info.
1288483048976154626 2020-07-29 10:34:32 EDT <A1Lex_> @Xfinity and these outages, shows skipping, freezing and just not working... I need money off my bill NOW. It‚Äôs not even raining and shit ain‚Äôt been working since yesterday
1288468672173006849 2020-07-29 09:37:24 EDT <SwankestMoney> My most fun night of gaming in awhile was cut short by an Xfinity internet outage last week... I was so upset. Otherwise I‚Äôve ironed out most of the kinks in my setup. Waiting for CenturyLink to drop a fiber line in my neighborhood so I can have redundant internet.
1288467501047853057 2020-07-29 09:32:45 EDT <Xfinity> Are you seeing any outage information showing in your My Account app?
1288464368565391366 2020-07-29 09:20:18 EDT <NaomiParfait> @HelperToni I don't want to be a HATER, but I'm listening to your @Xfinity commercial, & I WISH that were the case for me. Even when I am home alone, my internet cuts out at least 3 times an hour. I have them on "Favorites" b/c I call them so often to report my constant outages.
1288464310331756545 2020-07-29 09:20:04 EDT <sunflwrvoid> I know this is a first world problem but @Xfinity what‚Äôs with all the outages? I have meetings!  pic.twitter.com/CIOUOH0NSj
1288413990092234752 2020-07-29 06:00:07 EDT <jazzmina__> S/o to xfinity for having a service outage in my area üòí
1288353888807145472 2020-07-29 02:01:18 EDT <adamkstout> Dear @comcast @Xfinity, Why do I pay you $150/mo for internet when at least once a day it‚Äôs completely out? Tonight, like many nights, I can‚Äôt relax with @netflix or @HBO before bed, because you‚Äôre out again. We pay way too much for the frequency of outages and poor speeds. (1/2)
1288337777403322368 2020-07-29 00:57:16 EDT <CmonSpiderSense> @Xfinity why is it so common for my internet to be down I swear this is the 3rd to 4th outage this week and it‚Äôs only Wednesday !
1288324105645817856 2020-07-29 00:02:57 EDT <nayyalk> @comcastcares Hi, outage issues. Xfinity provided no reasons. Today + Sun were the worst, but it's been on+off last 2 weeks. Went frm 0 problems to 60 seemingly overnight. Have reset modem several times. Can't work, now totally unreliable, unpredictable connectivity. Pls help!
1288314658370265090 2020-07-28 23:25:24 EDT <rob_bodley> @Xfinity or dial-up, I‚Äôd choose dial-up. I‚Äôve never had this many outages in my life. I mean come on guys.
1288306992260550657 2020-07-28 22:54:57 EDT <sneha_gattu> @comcastcares how much more longer will the outage last üò≠üò≠ It‚Äôs been more than 12hrs! @Xfinity
1288306256122445824 2020-07-28 22:52:01 EDT <steelersjess> Well... here‚Äôs hoping Xfinity has this hours long outage issue fixed by the time I get up for work tomorrow...
1288303550062374912 2020-07-28 22:41:16 EDT <Victor_Vaughn> @Xfinity @comcastcares you all ever gonna get this outage in Boulder resolved?
1288300175669301248 2020-07-28 22:27:51 EDT <LikeCaandy> Same issue here but with Xfinity. Outages everywhere.
1288291169965752320 2020-07-28 21:52:04 EDT <renatiux99> Another Internet Service Outage at home, this is the 4th one since I woke up this morning. And their explanation is that this is a ‚Äúscheduled maintenance‚Äù, yeah right! I have not been able to work half the time. Thanks #Xfinity ü§¨
1288287887482642433 2020-07-28 21:39:02 EDT <mr3gg> @Xfinity hello I have a service outage, tried resetting modem but both internet and cable are offline - US/DS light is blinking.
1288283387745247232 2020-07-28 21:21:09 EDT <MelissaQuinn97> Love a good @Xfinity outage. While working from home. During a pandemic.
1288278852175835136 2020-07-28 21:03:08 EDT <NotUrCorpShawty> @Xfinity no one wants to get off of work after a 9-5 and deal with no internet during a pandemic. Fix the Arlington VA power outage. It shouldn‚Äôt take this long!
1288278525259190272 2020-07-28 21:01:50 EDT <bnels21> Why is it every time it storms, my @Xfinity internet goes out??? Every single time. Hours, even days at a time, there‚Äôs an outage. Why? I depend on my internet to work. This is incredibly frustrating.
1288277639883620352 2020-07-28 20:58:19 EDT <erinnavy> Is all what happening? The app and site are all saying that there is an outage. But it will come back on long enough to seem fixed then go back down again
1288277175163129861 2020-07-28 20:56:28 EDT <HiJackJ> According to their outage map, the number of affected zip codes has doubled since @comcast started working on the @Xfinity service outage.
1288271897260589056 2020-07-28 20:35:29 EDT <DupontDCSteve> @Xfinity Major outage in Arlington, VA. What's going on / ETA? Been out for 6+ hours.
1288265744430571521 2020-07-28 20:11:02 EDT <Arcticblast324> Hey @Xfinity what kind of outage takes *twelve hours* to fix?
1288264096442441728 2020-07-28 20:04:30 EDT <Prof_JTaylor> but really, I just want @Xfinity to fix the outage in my area so I can get back to my real work and avoid all this needless drama initiated by an opportunist who is only out for personal gain.
1288263292880814082 2020-07-28 20:01:18 EDT <KelseyAMcShane> Internet outage in @ArlingtonVA. But @Xfinity is aware and working on it! Thankfully üíôüíô
1288262476656672769 2020-07-28 19:58:03 EDT <NickC08> I need you to just fix the internet outage. @comcastcares is an oxymoron.
1288259977593925632 2020-07-28 19:48:08 EDT <Greg_PlayaMade> Yes. No outages. The WiFi modem won‚Äôt turn on after multiple resets.
1288259750199734284 2020-07-28 19:47:13 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked the Xfinity My Account app to see if there was a known outage in the area?
1288255905587499009 2020-07-28 19:31:57 EDT <Man1ckAtNight> Annnnnd @xfinity instantly shit the bed. Evidently there is an outage and it'll be down for at least 3 hours. FANTASTIC
1288255759403356160 2020-07-28 19:31:22 EDT <almightytye> xfinity chooses to have an outage as while i‚Äôm doing my homework
1288254620721123328 2020-07-28 19:26:50 EDT <natishtash> @Xfinity what is the status on the outage in the Ballston region of Arlington? When can we expect restoration?
1288253780790849539 2020-07-28 19:23:30 EDT <kaygall116> Any update on internet outage in Arlington VA? @xfinity
1288251490830888962 2020-07-28 19:14:24 EDT <ziadachkar> Looks like a large part of Arlington is facing a cable and internet outage. Seems like @Xfinity is having a problem.
1288245060044292096 2020-07-28 18:48:51 EDT <lumanicious> There's an #Xfinity outage in my building. Funny, this rarely ever happened with #Fios #XfinityOutage
1288239513790291969 2020-07-28 18:26:49 EDT <coerlin> @Xfinity Any real ETA on your outage in Weston, Florida? Not the 4 hours window nonsense in the account that keeps getting extended whenever the 4 hours are reached. This is your 3rd one in less than a month!!!
1288231093137747968 2020-07-28 17:53:21 EDT <SaibotQueen> @Xfinity @comcast What‚Äôs with the outage in south Florida?!
1288226345802240003 2020-07-28 17:34:29 EDT <MAljames_> @Xfinity when will the internet outage be fixed in Arlington VA?
1288201247686828034 2020-07-28 15:54:45 EDT <noturbine> @Xfinity Pool installer had just started excavating the back yard at 1015 Fairfax Lane, Weston, FL 33326 when the Internet and cable outage affecting this zip code started. Your phone system is not allowing me to speak to a human, so I'm tweeting.
1288200945654931458 2020-07-28 15:53:33 EDT <Get_Schwifty> @Xfinity please come to Stanwood, Wa. @WaveConnects is absolute garbage. Constant outages.
1288200858568732673 2020-07-28 15:53:12 EDT <_BigOldBuck_> outage
1288199892310138883 2020-07-28 15:49:22 EDT <Xfinity> Is there an outage in the area or are you having service issues?
1288197163760197632 2020-07-28 15:38:32 EDT <SuburbsMan> Hey @xfinity guess what?  Five days in a row of outages lasting all day means that @fios is being installed tomorrow between 10 AM and Noon.
1288189912152334336 2020-07-28 15:09:43 EDT <geojenkins> @Xfinity huh? Text says outage and link says no outage..? ü§î  pic.twitter.com/9Yf12sYVia
1288189148617211906 2020-07-28 15:06:41 EDT <Xfinity> Our support team here on Twitter can look into these outages for you. You can use this link:  https://xfin.tv/support¬† to send a message with your account number and any other details you would like to provide.
1288187699757711363 2020-07-28 15:00:55 EDT <Xfinity> Ok, I wanted to be sure we were aware of these outages.
1288185641419911168 2020-07-28 14:52:44 EDT <demond218> Yes. I‚Äôm notified every time. My issue is the frequency of the outages. This is at least the 3rd or 4th outage in the past 2 weeks.
1288185374896947202 2020-07-28 14:51:41 EDT <stanreeser> Hey @xfinity @comcastcares what's going on...can't even get to the outage map to check on the obvious #outage.   How fubar is everything there.  How extensive is the outage?
1288183267963703296 2020-07-28 14:43:19 EDT <KateElyse> This internet outage has been going on since 8:00 a.m. ... working from home without internet has not been awesome. @Xfinity please fix this. This work day has been terrible because of not having internet üò©üôèüèΩ Zip code 95123.
1288179233207070721 2020-07-28 14:27:17 EDT <Xfinity> You can check the Xfinity My Account app for updates on service, outage information and troubleshooting tips.
1288178137390444544 2020-07-28 14:22:55 EDT <jensorce> @Xfinity @comcast Internet down in ALL of #WestSeattle? Why do you only show outages when you‚Äôre logged in - how do I find somewhere there IS internet? I have a full work calendar today!! What happened to cause such a big outage?  pic.twitter.com/awN4Xc2h6j
1288175692681797641 2020-07-28 14:13:12 EDT <demond218> See I might have to leave @Xfinity cause every other day lately..there has been an outage. Anyone has @verizonfios ?? Is it any better?
1288173560347820033 2020-07-28 14:04:44 EDT <smohundro> Big @comcast / @Xfinity outage in 98116/#WestSeattle. That's one way to stop my kids from playing Fortnite. And to stop their parents from working.
1288148092441821186 2020-07-28 12:23:32 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked your My Account app to see if there's an outage in your area?
1288147375362584577 2020-07-28 12:20:41 EDT <Nursebee32> I just want to say @Suddenlink you guys have royally pissed me off, as a nursing student we have deadlines and if I am paying my bill an outage should not last for 2 days! Your service does suck and at this point just sale your company to comcast/xfinity/AT&T üôÑüôÑüôÑ
1288144990154174464 2020-07-28 12:11:12 EDT <Xfinity> Check the My Account app throughout the duration of the outage to see if updates are posted as the time of resolution may end up being sooner.
1288137002160812032 2020-07-28 11:39:28 EDT <AndrewCrow> Me: I have a really important video call this morning.   @xfinity: Cool cool. We‚Äôll be sure to trigger an outage in your area.   Me: No. wait. I need things to work.   Xfinity: Riiiiight. You want to not work (wink). We got you. EXPECTO SHUTDOWNUM!  Me: WTF. No!
1288134216593690625 2020-07-28 11:28:24 EDT <SocMedSean> oh look...yet ANOTHER area-wide @Xfinity outage. This makes five in six weeks time? Am I keeping count correctly? At least we got through last week without one. SMH
1288131029761511425 2020-07-28 11:15:44 EDT <alexclaiborne1> When there‚Äôs an @Xfinity outage and you‚Äôre working from home but it won‚Äôt be fixed for 3.5 hours and you can‚Äôt go anywhere else to work because COVID üôÉüôÉüôÉ
1288127636624101377 2020-07-28 11:02:15 EDT <AustenRisolvato> The app is showing no outages but that‚Äôs nonsense. We‚Äôve had more outages than not for a week and a half. I‚Äôve restarted the modem, the cables couldn‚Äôt be tighter if I tried, and it‚Äôs directly plugged into the source. This is insane.
1288121523358769156 2020-07-28 10:37:57 EDT <Xfinity> We can take a look. Are you seeing any outage information in your My Account app?
1288111338707750914 2020-07-28 09:57:29 EDT <That1DarkAsian> As of me leaving for work a few hours ago, it was working fine. I‚Äôm more upset by the lack of human interaction via the automated system than the outage itself.
1288110957244215300 2020-07-28 09:55:58 EDT <KeepRealCamille> Now that I‚Äôve been WFH for 4+ months, I realize I should be paying a lot less for internet considering the number of outages I have during random days @Xfinity ü§®
1288105310364880896 2020-07-28 09:33:32 EDT <Xfinity> Sorry for the downtime. Are you in an area outage currently?
1288102886849871872 2020-07-28 09:23:54 EDT <illMakeYou_LOL_> @Xfinity y‚Äôall going to have to credit me for that lil outage y‚Äôall had last night. I was in the middle of a movie mf.
1288097067525693440 2020-07-28 09:00:47 EDT <Xfinity> We would hate to lose you. Are you seeing any area outage information in your My Account app currently?
1287994222885314560 2020-07-28 02:12:07 EDT <QueenCoco_2U> @Xfinity was recreated to test my patience. The fact that I‚Äôve been on the phone for 50 minutes, originally asked if there was an outage, told no, about to make tech appt, for the lady to tell me she has to cancel appt because there‚Äôs an outage. üòëü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Nobel Peace Prize ME üéñ
1287986898103873536 2020-07-28 01:43:00 EDT <yoman4517> Hey there @Blezzie5 I've been good, took a break from the socials. About the internet thing, they must've hired a new network engineer who doesn't have a back up plan for outages! üòé other than that, I've been great I'll probably be on a bit more! Nice to hear from ya!
1287983755521597441 2020-07-28 01:30:31 EDT <yoman4517> Every night at the same time @Xfinity you some how create an outage! Are you going to create a refund for insecure internet? #xfinity always broken! #netblock ?
1287982742764953600 2020-07-28 01:26:30 EDT <barta_dan> @Xfinity Outages nearly every day in 60490. Trucks in the neighborhood daily for 3 weeks now. Can‚Äôt speak with a live person when I call. Your techs walking outside around slopey shouldered. Clock is ticking for this to be made right. WTF are we paying for?
1287974443629846529 2020-07-28 00:53:31 EDT <drf87> @Xfinity this is some bs tonight in the south Fulton area! 4 hour outage?
1287966435994554369 2020-07-28 00:21:42 EDT <That1DarkAsian> Tried calling the hotline, got hung up on by the automated system when I wanted to speak to an operator as this outage has halted my girlfriend‚Äôs work as well as my coding session and gaming session. Internet‚Äôs supposed to be out for another 4 hours. Thanks @Xfinity
1287936405356843008 2020-07-27 22:22:22 EDT <MagatsuDante> Let's add to that @Xfinity @comcast . I literally cannot get alerts for scheduled outages in the area, but you have no problems instantly alerting me on data usage.  You're able to introduce all your new AI stuff but you can't figure out a way to do away with your data cap?  pic.twitter.com/5coe1YsEDG
1287929054637756423 2020-07-27 21:53:09 EDT <dsrci2018> It's been three days and cable/Internet is still down. Have called @Ask_Spectrum every day and the excuse I get is that we had a power outage in my area but my power was restored two days ago. ü§î Time for @Xfinity to come down to the Rio Grande Valley.
1287928803650666496 2020-07-27 21:52:10 EDT <AbrielleKOtto> @Xfinity Outages daily for over a month... this is really getting out of hand.
1287922095255621632 2020-07-27 21:25:30 EDT <Af13718922> No outages. When I call Xfinity, the automated service says there will@be service done in my area on 7/29/2020 from 1am CST to 6am CST
1287921734956601346 2020-07-27 21:24:04 EDT <iridescentKatt> can't believe that my old shitty bankrupt ISP in bumfuck, pennsyltucky was more reliable than xfinity at my parents' house in the nyc metro area in the 4 years since I moved out for college - if its not a total outage like rn its multiple spurts of downtime daily
1287918604240003073 2020-07-27 21:11:38 EDT <Lukepetroneee> about 2 weeks in a row theres an outage EVERY DAY where i live. I get no solutions besides ‚Äúour technicians are working on it‚Äù. Its always around the same times too and my tv disconnects along with the wifi cause there‚Äôs no connection. We dont get good service to se we rely on it
1287917988151209984 2020-07-27 21:09:11 EDT <SwaggyBannanas> When trying to speak to a representative on the phone I was informed I could not speak to a representative while an outage is occuring.
1287917584105578498 2020-07-27 21:07:35 EDT <SwaggyBannanas> Yes, just reports there is an outage in my area, as there has been since 1 p.m. this afternoon. Said it would be fixed by 6:30. It's now 8.
1287916390201135105 2020-07-27 21:02:50 EDT <SwaggyBannanas> @Xfinity you call a 7 hour long and ongoing Internet outage without a single update on a time that it'll be fixed "Quality Customer Service"? What a joke!
1287910239421988864 2020-07-27 20:38:23 EDT <cjames9001> No one at @Xfinity wants to help resolve my outage. My tv service has been out in some capacity for over a week now
1287909853327962113 2020-07-27 20:36:51 EDT <cjames9001> @Xfinity well, I still have an outage after I thought everything was resolved, your staff told me they would call me back at 11AM, they did not. I spent another hour on the phone with support to no avail, and I‚Äôve responded to a message from @comcastcares and no response there
1287907921561554945 2020-07-27 20:29:11 EDT <jooniconic> xfinity really had an internet outage starting 30 minutes before i had to help with a virtual event my job was hosting and it JUST came back on. i had to do shit on my phone and it was hectic. monday is a wrap
1287903552975900672 2020-07-27 20:11:49 EDT <HillKyrsten> @Xfinity I need a ticket number for an outage and am trying to work. Is there a quicker way of finding it then waiting over an hour on the phone?
1287900516564062208 2020-07-27 19:59:45 EDT <Xfinity> Check the Xfinity My Account app for outage information.
1287899160734302208 2020-07-27 19:54:22 EDT <kmdesmarais> Interesting. I have daily outages & I have to connect to my phone‚Äôs hotspot multiple times a day, for multiple hours in order to be able to get any work done. Bought a new router & modem. Not to mention when I call, there isn‚Äôt even a live person to talk to. PLEASE HELP!!
1287898073998426112 2020-07-27 19:50:03 EDT <ema_mickeymouse> @Xfinity are there currently any outages going on? We currently don‚Äôt have cable, WiFi, nor will our house phone ring it goes straight to voice mail.
1287892339785170944 2020-07-27 19:27:16 EDT <weshawkins14> @Xfinity I would like to have internet at some point today, besides telling me there is an outage can you explain maybe why?
1287879941472677893 2020-07-27 18:38:00 EDT <jrgray> Thank goodness my mobile phone service is with @Verizon and not @xfinity or I would be completely screwed with the repeated @comcastcares (or doesn‚Äôt) outages the past week.  Every day @comcast service goes out.
1287870543807393795 2020-07-27 18:00:39 EDT <HeroicDiscord> @Xfinity Rockford Illinois is having a service outage. No notice given to customers. Can't actually get a hold of a human with your shitty phone system.  Your service is a train wreck in general.
1287867027202351104 2020-07-27 17:46:41 EDT <Xfinity> Is there an outage? Keep updated through the Xfinity My Account app.
1287864305216446465 2020-07-27 17:35:52 EDT <P05TPWND> I've done this. 0 help whatsoever. You can't just have an outage, deem it "restored" then tell your customers the problem's on them now. I HATE XFINITY SO MUCH
1287853439343624198 2020-07-27 16:52:41 EDT <ImTnFD> App doesnt really help. Says no outages connected to my address but there are outages like 30 seconds down the street and keeps asking me to troubleshoot which i did and nothing changes
1287840067092754433 2020-07-27 15:59:33 EDT <chiweethedog> wfh and have a daytime xfinity broadband outage - ‚Äúthe issue will be resolved in 4 hours‚Äù so i guess im drinking 30mg of this and then watching lamb recipe videos

1287823628038479873 2020-07-27 14:54:14 EDT <comcast> Have you checked the Xfinity My Account app to see if there was an outage in the area? -Gabbie

1287820398495662080 2020-07-27 14:41:24 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Ruth. Sorry to hear you've been having trouble. You can keep an eye on this site:  https://xfin.tv/30SW8GE¬† the latest updates if you're in an area outage.
1287819372543778816 2020-07-27 14:37:19 EDT <Ruth02009998> My service has been out ALL DAY. NO INTERNET, No tv and I work from home. I can‚Äôt connect to hotspot either. Outage in the area was to be completed at 8:30am and I can‚Äôt call Comcast because they claim a rep won‚Äôt be able help me.  Seriously!!!
1287818933718974464 2020-07-27 14:35:34 EDT <Mengle76> @comcast @Xfinity Why is this becoming a reg occurance? Started with short connectivity issues (almost daily) the last couple months, now we‚Äôre into outages for hours at a time regularly. Are you compensating for all the missed work, and no service? #Mundelein #VernonHills pic.twitter.com/KHQ0ksN5en
1287800931090944002 2020-07-27 13:24:02 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked your My Account app to see if there's an outage in your area?
1287794599235330053 2020-07-27 12:58:53 EDT <weshawkins14> Internet outage, we have made it 3 months of lockdown with no problems now all of a sudden it doesn‚Äôt work and is scheduled to be fixed ‚Äúsometime‚Äù in the next 4 hours? Cmon that‚Äôs half a day of work lost
1287790344336285697 2020-07-27 12:41:58 EDT <crettich> Third @Xfinity outage this month. Really tired of this when we‚Äôre trying to work from home. Guess the internet is having a case of the Mondays too...
1287788381242523649 2020-07-27 12:34:10 EDT <Tammyralexander> We moved from Xfinity to NineStar several years ago and this email is a BIG reason why. I sincerely appreciate the communication offered during the outage and this letter. This outage did suck, but you owned it and I am sure will learn from it.
1287785622170742788 2020-07-27 12:23:12 EDT <Xfinity> We apologize for this outage, we're working to fix this ASAP.
1287784756436963330 2020-07-27 12:19:46 EDT <WJeffreyBrown> I'd like to thank @Xfinity for having an internet outage just as an important conference call starts.
1287784118605029378 2020-07-27 12:17:14 EDT <rubythesauce1> @comcastcares @Xfinity @comcast What‚Äôs with the long outage of all services in the City of Atlanta today? Would appreciate any updates.
1287784061847601152 2020-07-27 12:17:00 EDT <SNewton29> I expected @Xfinity (Comcast) to be bad, but wow, they‚Äôre met my expectations for awful service and blown them away. From the cashier getting my information wrong when signing up (couldn‚Äôt do it online), to massive outages every day, they‚Äôve done it all.
1287764483805458433 2020-07-27 10:59:13 EDT <AustenRisolvato> My god @Xfinity is horrible. This is now a week and a half of sporadic outages throughout the day.
1287757622662377475 2020-07-27 10:31:57 EDT <JaySwanCards> Yes it is not showing an outage and the wait times on phone support are about an hour.
1287755866276601864 2020-07-27 10:24:58 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked your My Account app to see if there's an outage in your area?
1287656319692894209 2020-07-27 03:49:24 EDT <egadmypickle> Great, @Xfinity @comcast outage. So, my speed sucks, working from home and you‚Äôre throwing data caps on my supposed 1GB line that only gets 100 MBs on a good day.  #Comcastic. #XfinitySucks
1287561947802734598 2020-07-26 21:34:24 EDT <jmherbst> And another outage @comcastcares @Xfinity  4th(maybe 5th?) Full outage in 2 weeks.....  pic.twitter.com/H07rIXezdU
1287559156103340038 2020-07-26 21:23:19 EDT <jlindgren78> @Xfinity Why am I having issues with my WiFi and it says there‚Äôs no outages? If tried restarting the modem. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1287552909069049857 2020-07-26 20:58:29 EDT <TomBobbitt> @Xfinity daily service outage. 8 days in a row so far....  pic.twitter.com/m97zYfBY9B
1287535022304632833 2020-07-26 19:47:25 EDT <SoxyMomma12> Still having outages.  Found out last week that all on my block have same problem.  Was told it was fixed today.  Wrong.  Still an issue.  How long must we wait to get service
1287534351144693760 2020-07-26 19:44:45 EDT <SoxyMomma12> @Xfinity intermittent internet and cable outages for 1 month.  Learned last week that all people on my block have this problem.  Was told it was fixed today. Still not working. How long must we wait for a resolution
1287532043887357952 2020-07-26 19:35:35 EDT <SoxyMomma12> @Xfinity for 1 month I have been dealing with xfinity because I experience intermittent outages on the internet and cable. Our whole block has problems and it has not been fixed. How long must we wait
1287531643541098499 2020-07-26 19:33:59 EDT <TomBobbitt> Time for the daily xfinity service outage  pic.twitter.com/elzBwIdISv
1287528958813179907 2020-07-26 19:23:19 EDT <LegerDouzable> Whats up with this outage @Xfinity  smh
1287524778975395840 2020-07-26 19:06:43 EDT <neinmuses> @Xfinity multiple outages a week where I live, sometimes more than once per DAY. I'm in Minneapolis, not the sticks. what am I paying all this money for when the service is so constantly patchy?
1287506093955002368 2020-07-26 17:52:28 EDT <DaveTheAwesome> Attempted to report outage to @xfinity , but they told me it‚Äôd be 2 days to get a technician and it‚Äôs a $39.99 charge ... there‚Äôs a cut cable outside of the house to the post, and their agent said to grab a ladder and fix it myself. The liability is scary, surprised.
1287501608373358595 2020-07-26 17:34:38 EDT <shantralaye> @Xfinity has me 3 seconds to switching to @ATT for cable due to billing issues & service outages in Atlanta and I have been with them for 10yrs. My cable was out for 6 days & they ONLY offered me $40 credit &dismissed the fact that working from home you lose money w/ no WiFi
1287497573427810306 2020-07-26 17:18:36 EDT <zia_kat> @comcastcares @xfinity when people have outages their accounts should be instantly credited (oc we all know why you don't do that). we shouldn't have to keep calling and getting hung up on by your automated nonsense. i want a credit for the outage and my wasted time on the phone.
1287496978541219848 2020-07-26 17:16:14 EDT <AMB_Noni> @Xfinity is everything ok? You have had an outage everyday for the last 16 days?yes, I‚Äôve been counting. We don‚Äôt pay you this much to not have service for hours during the day. Should we move our service to @verizonfios?
1287493901998145536 2020-07-26 17:04:01 EDT <RainbowSaloon> @Xfinity our cable has been out at our business since yesterday morning. When I call they say its an outage and no idea when it will be fixed. A supervisor can't call back for 24 hrs. Can anyone help?
1287480926281195520 2020-07-26 16:12:27 EDT <JoseAnayaTV> So many @Xfinity internet outages this week. So frustrating.  #xfinityoutage
1287479952212987904 2020-07-26 16:08:35 EDT <TafariTheDon> Power went yesterday mid series and now xfinity outage. God why are you protecting these niggas from my wrath ?  pic.twitter.com/vMNlvLpf1x
1287464460752433154 2020-07-26 15:07:02 EDT <armandh0e> Now why they telling me there‚Äôs a xfinity outage in the area...they better refund me for these minutes im not able to use wifiüòë
1287463713239269377 2020-07-26 15:04:03 EDT <CH7799> @Xfinity If xfinity is here to support us during this pandemic then tell me why my data usage for the first half of the month was barely 400 then after a maintenance outage the usage today is almost 1200
1287453285645815808 2020-07-26 14:22:37 EDT <alane0101> @Xfinity @comcastcares My Xfinity modem keeps going down but I can't send a restart signal from my phone because you don't think I'm an Xfinity customer. üôÉ We've unplugged the modem repeatedly, to no avail, and you're not reporting an outage in our area.  pic.twitter.com/XlQzH2ciP8
1287436065855483905 2020-07-26 13:14:12 EDT <__Dejanaaaaaaa> I‚Äôm so mad that @Xfinity has an outage FOR THEN SECOND DAY IN A ROW  in my area !!!!!!! It‚Äôs like they purposely fucking with my shit ü§¨
1287386014504357889 2020-07-26 09:55:18 EDT <Twasinit> @Xfinity how ‚Äòbout you fix your service? My bill better reflect outages. You can‚Äôt charge $$$$ if you can‚Äôt supply the service. It doesn‚Äôt work that way.
1287290205368733696 2020-07-26 03:34:36 EDT <erictakesphotos> @comcastcares Please share your secrets to time travel üò¨ This agent is clueless and can't tell the difference between my home router and the XFinity public wifi on the street. Both are down. I just wanted to report an outage.  pic.twitter.com/qL4uhm0Bkx
1287241715942928388 2020-07-26 00:21:55 EDT <jaeminsoveraIIs> THERES AN XFINITY OUTAGE IN MY AREA UNTIL 4 IN THE MORNING I HATE IT HERE
1287228006700810240 2020-07-25 23:27:26 EDT <MissKadiG> Hey @Xfinity ever thought about making your outage times realistic? ‚ÄúMinutes long‚Äù outage is hours... #whatajoke
1287215908671434752 2020-07-25 22:39:22 EDT <SeanLDonegan> 3 days in a row, 3 ‚Äúfixes,‚Äù still not working.  When will this end @Xfinity @comcastcares ?  This is unbelievably bad.    Shades of the UVerse days when they wanted us to call in every time there was an outage...so we called multiple times, EVERY day.    Unacceptable.
1287206560968708096 2020-07-25 22:02:13 EDT <KarmaLovesGumbo> Nothing at the moment. Cable outage in our area. Mpls, MN.
1287204754607620097 2020-07-25 21:55:03 EDT <tayyeee> Cable/WiFi outage, @Xfinity get your shit together.
1287197612190441472 2020-07-25 21:26:40 EDT <zlloyd23> @Xfinity @comcast Literally the 4th time this week we have had a 4+ hour outage. So much for reliable internet üôÑ  pic.twitter.com/ueWZs51hBj
1287174818673065985 2020-07-25 19:56:05 EDT <_eeenomis_> @Xfinity Hello. Can anyone tell me if there‚Äôs a outage in the Greater Houston/Galveston area?
1287157145721614336 2020-07-25 18:45:52 EDT <FakerH2D> My job changed what I'd be teaching last minute so I have to spend today/tomorrow learning last minute and now I have an Xfinity outage until 10 this sucks
1287148976383426564 2020-07-25 18:13:24 EDT <jmherbst> @Xfinity @comcastcares my entire neighborhood is having intermittent internet (10%, sometime 50% pkt loss) for 2 wks since a full outage happened.  I've tried for hrs on the üìû, but have had 0 luck convincing you to send out someone to actually resolve our issue.  Plshelp
1287137167681232896 2020-07-25 17:26:29 EDT <DavidMoorad> @xfinity sucks! Continued periodic outages in Sarasota  since early July! @comcastcares @comcast does not work. Offices are closed. Techs are at a loss. I bring it back and it comes back within a few days. Awful service
1287125580740272129 2020-07-25 16:40:26 EDT <ChrisPedersen80> @Xfinity I‚Äôm hoping all the outage this week will be reflected in our bill. #xfinity #xfinityoutage #tinleypark
1287120883195183109 2020-07-25 16:21:46 EDT <iAM_xFryLockx> Come on @Xfinity let's get this together with this outage I have things to do
1287114370753814528 2020-07-25 15:55:54 EDT <Vanderlisa> @Xfinity outages in Seattle?
1287108139712643072 2020-07-25 15:31:08 EDT <TheBookOfRabbit> ESL players, beware of PSN ‚Äúomrenval‚Äù as he is DDOSing players in the tournament.  My entire internet connection mysteriously dropped as I was taking a lead. Confirmed it‚Äôs not an xfinity outage.   My run of bad luck continues in these tournaments.
1287101073073811457 2020-07-25 15:03:03 EDT <DavidMoorad> @comcastcares It is nuts in Sarasota, FL. #xfinity has been experiencing consistent outages and has been unable to correct them. Reboots, customer service calls, replacing boxes and remotes. Unbelievable.  NO HELP!
1287050005417787393 2020-07-25 11:40:08 EDT <joepotente> @comcastcares what is going on with service in Bloomington-Normal IL. TV, Internet and Voice are all down. @Xfinity App doesn‚Äôt work to check for outage info. Waiting on call back from customer service.
1287027664386220032 2020-07-25 10:11:21 EDT <BladeScotty> I waited 4 days for a ‚Äúworking on the problem now‚Äù @Xfinity outage. Fingers crossed yours gets a bandaid in it quick.
1287026390177546253 2020-07-25 10:06:17 EDT <DDangerfeld> How? Are you going to fix the outages entire neighborhoods are dealing with by getting my info on a DM? No...you all just want us off main Twitter so @xfinity execs can't see how they are FAILING!!!!!
1287019803534925825 2020-07-25 09:40:07 EDT <Adiofreak> Yo @Xfinity can yinz like fire whoever updates the outage maps? I have no internet for like the 10th time this week.
1287009209519869953 2020-07-25 08:58:01 EDT <prophet_monkey> I thankfully have had no outages since I moved with xfinity.  I'd drop them if I did.  I have to work from home
1286959890095906821 2020-07-25 05:42:03 EDT <temptingdank> Someone cancel .@Xfinity because they are incompetent as hell with these rolling fucking outages. I want a goddamn credit.
1286928301747994624 2020-07-25 03:36:31 EDT <PenguinTweet> Lost Comcast wifi during thunderstorm, pleased to say they had outage notice on website immediately and repaired it 2 hours sooner than promised. OTOH their chat person walked my son through several troubleshooting steps without mentioning outage that we could do nothing about üôÇ
1286927107289948160 2020-07-25 03:31:46 EDT <dietmillertime> @Xfinity your outage issues are ridiculous. Especially considering we‚Äôre being charged more per month for no reason explained to us.
1286923903160528896 2020-07-25 03:19:03 EDT <s3kia> @comcast @Xfinity your service is shit every week there is an outage and takes a long ass time to fix
1286899328284426242 2020-07-25 01:41:23 EDT <jessibruh> This is the second time xfinity has had an outage this week üò© yo, seriously I‚Äôm just trying to finish the Epstein series üò≠

1286857921272385537 2020-07-24 22:56:51 EDT <CareyM06> Yo, @Xfinity what's up with the 24 hour internet outage. Keeps giving an automated of a few hours from whatever time for a solution and that solution never appears

1286722008429068288 2020-07-24 13:56:47 EDT <Xfinity> We can help with the internet issues. Does the My Account app list any area outages?
1286715697146535937 2020-07-24 13:31:42 EDT <comcast> Did you check the Xfinity My Account app to see info on any possible planned maintenance or outages in the area? -Gabbie
1286704778442145793 2020-07-24 12:48:19 EDT <hexideciml> @Xfinity will I be receiving a credit for this outage?
1286698629181382662 2020-07-24 12:23:53 EDT <DogLovinBear> So there was an @Xfinity outage and they say service was restored but I still have NO INTERNET ACCESS.   Trying to #WorkFromHome and this doesn‚Äôt help
1286689614577754114 2020-07-24 11:48:04 EDT <Mikey_P_13> I got rid of their $58324 cable package long ago. Now I just deal with their frequent internet outages
1286686838745378817 2020-07-24 11:37:02 EDT <PrettyMaria08> Damn how long does it take for @Xfinity to fix an outage!???? My services have been off going on 12 hours now! I know I feel a credit in my spirit cuz I‚Äôm burning my data up baby!!! üò´üò©
1286684414550986757 2020-07-24 11:27:24 EDT <VVoPham> @Xfinity, this is like the third time I‚Äôve had my internet cut off (in like three months). What is going on here with these outages??? I‚Äôm really thinking about switching providers. This is ridiculous.
1286681690019176448 2020-07-24 11:16:34 EDT <andy_atlantis> @Xfinity nice that youre so quick to tack on late fees but not so quick to fix your outages thank you for your amazing service
1286680428020195328 2020-07-24 11:11:34 EDT <brisurb> Have had Uverse for 4 years on 4 TVs with DVR‚Äôs and have 1 outage for 30 minutes.   Xfinity sucks I‚Äôll keep my UVERSE and $68.00 bill compared to my neighbors Xfinity bill of $200.00 on 3 TVs.
1286676262375874561 2020-07-24 10:55:00 EDT <ThrashArmador> Universe has been way better than Comcast Xfinity.  Better price, more channels.  I have had zero service outages since going back to them 2 years ago.  Before that, I had Xfinity for 2 years and it was a joke.
1286669343191961600 2020-07-24 10:27:31 EDT <andy_atlantis> here go @Xfinity asses havin an outage again crazy how yall never miss a beat remindin me to pay but cant keep stable service
1286669303367032833 2020-07-24 10:27:21 EDT <Xfinity> Do you have the Xfinity My Account app? You can send signal refreshes on your own and it'll have information if there are any outages or planned maintenance happening in the area.
1286660793992269824 2020-07-24 09:53:32 EDT <lanifoprez> Xfinity always havin some sort of outage with their dumbasses
1286659353517404160 2020-07-24 09:47:49 EDT <MarkRMartell> Another morning with an @Xfinity outage. This has been going on for about a month now. What's going on in Lakeview/Chicago, @comcastcares ?
1286653949391536130 2020-07-24 09:26:21 EDT <catnamedmittens> @Xfinity I appreciate the numerous emails that say you‚Äôre there for your customers during the pandemic. However, they don‚Äôt mean squat when my internet is down. Fix the Xfinity outage in Northern VA so I can work!
1286651808379740163 2020-07-24 09:17:50 EDT <AlexLeighh> @Xfinity there has been an outage in my area for EVERY DAY this week around this same time in the morning. Can you please tell me what is going on and when this is going to stop?  pic.twitter.com/9Z7A6JwyYp
1286649640004222984 2020-07-24 09:09:13 EDT <ariellahaileyxo> Like i mentioned I was on a support chat for an hour. They said they checked everything and it‚Äôs something wrong with the connection, but they won‚Äôt get anyone out for two days. Even though there was an outage for 5 hours last night. There‚Äôs constantly issues with xfinity.
1286647439701807105 2020-07-24 09:00:29 EDT <ariellahaileyxo> There is no outage. That‚Äôs the thing. Now I have to wait days for my internet to be fixed for something that your company caused.
1286639761533349890 2020-07-24 08:29:58 EDT <Cyberhalogen> @comcast @comcastcares @Xfinity what the hell is going at 77407? Why is there an outage without customer notification?
1286638516504539136 2020-07-24 08:25:01 EDT <Xfinity> Hi! You can download the Xfinity My Account to get the most updated information about the outage.
1286627261739864069 2020-07-24 07:40:18 EDT <ListeningToFilm> Hey @Xfinity this is now your fourth outage in two days. Just saying
1286579483307171840 2020-07-24 04:30:26 EDT <Dope415> @Xfinity power outage through throughout San Francisco smh
1286529561610657794 2020-07-24 01:12:04 EDT <JBooshy> #xfinity Is so shit... Two outages in three days! WHAT THE FUCK ARE YALL DOING?!
1286517997394329600 2020-07-24 00:26:07 EDT <OIIIIIIIO_Jeeep> @Xfinity @comcastcares @comcast is there a known service outage for the Saint Paul/Minneapolis, MN area?.? It of nowhere internet went out, restarted all devices and still no internet access...
1286497904866267136 2020-07-23 23:06:17 EDT <JCookDC> Hey @PoPville is there a Comcast/Xfinity outage in Columbia Heights/surrounding areas?
1286495025942142976 2020-07-23 22:54:50 EDT <khabxgg> Xfinity outage in NE DC? #comcast #xfinity
1286486268826664961 2020-07-23 22:20:02 EDT <DseanLoyd> Xfinity internet is so annoying goddamn chill with these outages
1286485830261968899 2020-07-23 22:18:18 EDT <SwankestMoney> Clip from the stream right before an Xfinity outage took a dump on my night.    https://clips.twitch.tv/GloriousResilientPlumberNerfBlueBlaster¬†‚Ä¶
1286475198594789379 2020-07-23 21:36:03 EDT <ariellahaileyxo> @Xfinity can you please give an update on the 48917 lansing Michigan outage??
1286474688235843584 2020-07-23 21:34:01 EDT <Supaztv> @Xfinity We the customers who pay you the company shouldn‚Äôt have to keep having outages every other day for x amount of time throughout the day. Honestly the throttled internet‚Äôs connects are bad enough now you want to have outages? Please fix the issues.
1286472597635563523 2020-07-23 21:25:43 EDT <Teejey3DFS> Ahh yes, its time for my daily internet outage. @Xfinity
1286466291486691329 2020-07-23 21:00:39 EDT <Very_NESSAsary> Xfinity and all their outages smh
1286455226472505345 2020-07-23 20:16:41 EDT <Sin_iShaw> @Xfinity I‚Äôve called dozens of times and I‚Äôm still having internet issues. New box, didn‚Äôt fix it. Restarted modems, didn‚Äôt fix. Messed with settings, didn‚Äôt fix. No outages. SEND A TECH OUT TO MY HOUSE OR IM CANCELING YOUR GARBAGE SERVICE!
1286453992403460097 2020-07-23 20:11:47 EDT <DebbraT> @Xfinity interesting timing for an outage... @TuckerCarlson starts & outage begins.ü§î
1286436842645135362 2020-07-23 19:03:38 EDT <jdub197736> @Xfinity is there an outage that you know of in Scranton, Pa? TV and internet has been out for a while now
1286433966694764544 2020-07-23 18:52:13 EDT <Jeliana867> Wifi. It's been outages for days and hrs at a time. When will this end?
1286419871916490756 2020-07-23 17:56:12 EDT <TheEthanClark> @ATT any chance we can get some fiber in the Alger Heights area in Grand Rapids, MI? You've got a whole neighborhood of people who are done with @Xfinity/@Comcast's old infrastructure that leads to constant internet outages.
1286403114136997889 2020-07-23 16:49:37 EDT <musicbrittany97> @Xfinity this is the second day in a row that there has been an outage in my area that starts the moment I get home from work, and doesn‚Äôt get resolved until the next morning. This is ridiculous to not have WiFi bc of a little rain üôÉ
1286399152713334787 2020-07-23 16:33:52 EDT <Im_TSG> @Xfinity how many times this week are yall gonna have an outage in my area your service sucks
1286386088840441859 2020-07-23 15:41:58 EDT <Motor_city313> @Xfinity wow was going to complain about your crappy internet that goes down daily for the pass month but I see other people are already complaining. Love paying for internet nthat never works but yet their is no outages in my area but my neighbor is out too
1286367914925289472 2020-07-23 14:29:45 EDT <solarpower69> @comcastcares @Xfinity @comcast   internet and cable outage for the past 4 hours!!  But nothing in the outage map and you have to send a technician to fix!?!  Worked fine yesterday and nothing changed between then and now.  pic.twitter.com/C8jIwJBuUJ
1286366108212236289 2020-07-23 14:22:34 EDT <TheIPGuru1> @Xfinity @comcast I‚Äôve called your phone number multiple times.There‚Äôs been outages for over two weeks during office hours during a time when people are trying to survive working from home.   These outages have cost me several hundreds of dollars to my business. THIS IS NOT OKAY.
1286364376145043458 2020-07-23 14:15:41 EDT <SNewton29> I just switched to Xfinity and have had outages for internet every day I've had it.
1286352439168380931 2020-07-23 13:28:15 EDT <Xfinity> Hey! You can check your My Account app to see if you're affected by an outage in your area.
1286348403564261382 2020-07-23 13:12:13 EDT <cullygothands> i have mad work to do & there‚Äôs an xfinity outage in my area...  pic.twitter.com/6GBl911Nnm
1286342254500732928 2020-07-23 12:47:47 EDT <CDSouther> So which is it @comcast @Xfinity ? Either there's an outage, or there's not. It can't be both at the same time.  pic.twitter.com/RuRhkgNQGn
1286339115827564552 2020-07-23 12:35:18 EDT <kitticatpat> Why am I expected to pay my full internet bill when there is constantly Xfinity/Comcast outages? Make it make sense üòë
1286335371488436225 2020-07-23 12:20:26 EDT <Xfinity> Sorry for the interruption! If you're in an area outage, be sure to keep an eye on your My Account app for updates.
1286333340505841666 2020-07-23 12:12:21 EDT <Carmeldip> Internet outage as usual...
1286332891522375682 2020-07-23 12:10:34 EDT <Xfinity> Are you in an area outage?
1286332162019667968 2020-07-23 12:07:40 EDT <youngCousCous> Literally me, its ridiculous I have to call them and tell them hey my services werent working, dont charge me for those days otherwise they‚Äôll act like it never happened. Im telling the rep to check for outages for the last month to get like a $15 credit or something not worth it
1286329821593829379 2020-07-23 11:58:22 EDT <_jjaammiiee> @comcast @Xfinity has the absolute worst service I have ever experienced. Two outages in the last two weeks alone. Constant lapse in service in the middle of the day. I could go on for hours. Absolutely TERRIBLE.
1286323230849081347 2020-07-23 11:32:11 EDT <HOUGH_N_PUFF> I pay a lot of money for internet just to have an outage every other day @Xfinity @comcast
1286319036712669184 2020-07-23 11:15:31 EDT <jjbjeff22> Is xfinity aware of an outage in the Seattle area? I was supposed to start working 3 hours ago and haven‚Äôt been able to. I have no access to account info as I pay for access via rent.
1286317155097563136 2020-07-23 11:08:03 EDT <nicolelynnpitts> Yeah yeah. There was an outage for hoursssss. And the problem is, my apartment came with the internet so I don't have login info to log into an account to do shit online. Its frustrating.
1286317110000529410 2020-07-23 11:07:52 EDT <lizdecember> Ughhhhh this freaking xfinity outage! They say it‚Äôll be resolved in 4 hours, then push it back another hour!!! I need to get off my hotspot  pic.twitter.com/9OU2P11tPN
1286307918837678082 2020-07-23 10:31:20 EDT <MarkRMartell> @Xfinity Why is there a daily outage in Lakeview (Chicago) every. single. morning!? This has been going on for a couple of months now.
1286303705172791296 2020-07-23 10:14:36 EDT <Rob_Sawicki> @ARLnowDOTcom Looks like there‚Äôs a pretty significant Xfinity outage in Arlington right now.  pic.twitter.com/RaVP5CFd5m
1286302814420062209 2020-07-23 10:11:03 EDT <lanc1011> Yes, outage for the second day in a row. Not able to work because of this. I need more reliable internet!!
1286300289818034178 2020-07-23 10:01:02 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Luis. Are you in an area outage?
1286286779432275969 2020-07-23 09:07:20 EDT <Xfinity> Great - you can always keep track of the status of an outage through the Xfinity My Account app.
1286282997369536512 2020-07-23 08:52:19 EDT <trendoid> CRAP! - An XFINITY Services outage has been reported in your area. We're working hard to get your service up and running. The issue will be resolved 07/23/2020 08:23 AM (Eastern). Thank you for your patience. (It's not fixed yet btw)
1286282815928250368 2020-07-23 08:51:35 EDT <Xfinity> Outage?
1286281112478724096 2020-07-23 08:44:49 EDT <amandabise> @Xfinity @comcast @comcastcares I did check the outage map. For the past 2 hours it said it would be resolved at 8:23am, it‚Äôs 8:44am now and it doesn‚Äôt show a resolve time.  pic.twitter.com/I4JXV8Bgsy
1286280497803464706 2020-07-23 08:42:23 EDT <Xfinity> Hi! If you're in an area outage, keep an eye on your My Account app for updates. You can also sign up for text alerts through there so you know when you're back up and running.
1286280002774933516 2020-07-23 08:40:25 EDT <amandabise> @Xfinity any update on the outage in east central Indiana?...asking for myself who was supposed to be at work 40 mins ago.
1286240533401096192 2020-07-23 06:03:35 EDT <SkunkySwisher> Sign up for their status reports via text! And also check the Comcast website status page. They had outages in our area
1286233170581610496 2020-07-23 05:34:19 EDT <cultofqueer> I am SICK of @Xfinity internet! I‚Äôve had the worst service interruptions last 3 weeks. Everytime I get 2 support they say there is a corrupt boot file then they send new signal then it‚Äôs fine. Fast forward a few hours & all jacked up. Now an outage! Hello @ATT I am coming!
1286206840615796736 2020-07-23 03:49:42 EDT <RParrish24> "We're experiencing outages in your area" - @Xfinity (ComTRASH)  pic.twitter.com/DG7sPVQp3V
1286204416153006080 2020-07-23 03:40:03 EDT <taVulpix> Xfinity. But we had a huge thunderstorm so it was kinda justified. I mostly fell asleep through the outage.
1286203906607820800 2020-07-23 03:38:02 EDT <ixICEMANxi> I really wish I had @googlefiber in my area. Because @Xfinity is consistently having outages, like tonight. And it's infuriating. I just want to relax on my night off and play games. But can't because Xfinity can't do the one thing they're good for. It shouldn't take 4 hours üò†
1286171605618524162 2020-07-23 01:29:41 EDT <weaslewoozle> Nah, xfinity has an outage rn and it's driving me up the damn wall. Fios is better
1286157092177534976 2020-07-23 00:32:01 EDT <IntimateApple> Nothing like getting home from work and @xfinity greating you with the 2nd outage this month ü•∞  pic.twitter.com/Sfpft9Has8
1286144841097850882 2020-07-22 23:43:20 EDT <brian_spiller> @comcastcares 3rd day in a row cable, phone &  internet out due to an outage. Can‚Äôt reach a live person. Xfinity chat agents seem incompetent and provide false information. How do I reach an actual person?
1286126870384320512 2020-07-22 22:31:55 EDT <imayra21> @Xfinity the constant outages every 72 hours its not acceptable
1286126744295022594 2020-07-22 22:31:25 EDT <GothwaveLtd> @comcastcares what‚Äôs up  With the poor service for @PrimeVideo on #Xfinity? Three days of pic freezing and sound outage. Get it together I need to #WATCH @AcornTV #DeadStill
1286125012420907009 2020-07-22 22:24:32 EDT <SolitudeChosen> HANDS DOWN @comcast @xfinity @comcastcares  has to be the worst company in the world. Since 1pm EST there has been an unexplained outage in our small area and its 10.22pm with no update or fix by this horrible company. Missed work, stocks. Almost missed Verzuz ü§¨
1286118339111276549 2020-07-22 21:58:01 EDT <Xfinity> Hey. Does the Xfinity My Account app show an area outage? If not, send a DM with the account info using this link:  https://xfin.tv/support¬† for assistance with troubleshooting.
1286115208767967235 2020-07-22 21:45:35 EDT <Tysheaaaa> i know one thing xfinity better hurry & resolve this ‚Äúoutage‚Äù üòë
1286112946414919680 2020-07-22 21:36:35 EDT <bluebird1059> No, no outages. There never are. It drops multiple times a day and has done this for years. Every time I call I'm told things are fine on y'alls end so it has to be on my end. But if that were true then resetting my router would work but that never does.
1286109952860459008 2020-07-22 21:24:42 EDT <AMB_Noni> We have had an outage for over 8hrs. I‚Äôm fucking sick of this shit.
1286105955546079234 2020-07-22 21:08:49 EDT <Xfinity> We can look into the internet issues. Do you know if the My Account app is showing any area outages?
1286103418604584964 2020-07-22 20:58:44 EDT <ListeningToFilm> Admittedly I don‚Äôt know much about internet outages (other than that they happen frequently with @Xfinity but this strikes me as a remarkably exact restoration time...  pic.twitter.com/U51HWQ5Pkp
1286101356957380614 2020-07-22 20:50:32 EDT <Xfinity> Does the My Account app list any area outages? If not, could you try restarting the gateway?
1286096273737646080 2020-07-22 20:30:20 EDT <DriverBrian> So we lose our 2 year contract discount as of next month. Our @Xfinity bill goes up $25+. Now we get this. Can't watch a thing right now. App says no outage in our area. @DIRECTV or @Verizon ? My @xfinitymobile account doesn't matter either. #nocustomerloyalty pic.twitter.com/QFO94NBOLm
1286094293950660609 2020-07-22 20:22:28 EDT <rxchgold> Now it‚Äôs an Xfinity outage in the area. Today should‚Äôve been a good with the NBA coming back smh
1286091754664529921 2020-07-22 20:12:23 EDT <ianpudge> @Xfinity if there‚Äôs no outage in my area, or anywhere on the map you‚Äôre showing, why is the wait time so long to speak to someone?  #noservice pic.twitter.com/NiDNR5vcUv
1286070485307068417 2020-07-22 18:47:52 EDT <luckeystars> *me going to the xfinity app to see when they think the cable will be back* Xfinity: there is no outage in your area. Have you tried turning your tv off and turning it back on again? Is it plugged in? üôÑ
1286067150634057729 2020-07-22 18:34:37 EDT <DogLovinBear> Another goddamn @Xfinity outage or some problem. Like I‚Äôm a fucking network engineer
1286061821577715712 2020-07-22 18:13:26 EDT <Suzzicks> Ya - it says there is an outage in my zip code.
1286054405415014403 2020-07-22 17:43:58 EDT <Xfinity> We apologize for the constant issues you've been facing, we can help. Are you seeing an area outage in your My Account app?
1286050265452310529 2020-07-22 17:27:31 EDT <redwingwizard> lol we have Xfinity but I think there's a major outage or something lol
1286040879531266050 2020-07-22 16:50:13 EDT <Xfinity> When these outages occur are there notices listed in the My Account app or web portal for you?
1286039831273967616 2020-07-22 16:46:03 EDT <kaiser891> @comcast @xfinity OMG your service SUCKS!!!  Outage every day... wtf???
1286036365294080001 2020-07-22 16:32:17 EDT <RiceGodd> Of course an internet outage in my area would happen on my day off, why you gotta do me like this Xfinity :(
1286025253605408768 2020-07-22 15:48:08 EDT <jeremy_dm> #Xfinity keeps notifying me that I am over 100% of my data cap. Which is  1. Ridiculous that they imposed a data cap on home internet service.  And 2. Unlikely, given that the service experiences so many outages that I doubt its up enough in a month to reach a data cap. @Xfinity
1286024074389577729 2020-07-22 15:43:27 EDT <jrgray> Another day, another outage for @xfinity.  @comcastcares, what are you doing to solve this issue?  #comcastic service as always! pic.twitter.com/PgHQR9N1jE
1286008827146579971 2020-07-22 14:42:51 EDT <LaurieGoodell> @Xfinity Cable outage in 20724 area. People trying to work from home here! üôÅ
1286006954121482242 2020-07-22 14:35:25 EDT <AMB_Noni> @Xfinity what is going on with your service? I‚Äôve had service outages everyday for this month. I‚Äôm about ready to switch to another provider if y‚Äôall can‚Äôt provide the service we pay for.
1286000013181620224 2020-07-22 14:07:50 EDT <Xfinity> Hi. The Xfinity My Account app will provide outage details along with an estimated time of resolution so be sure to check there.
1285999665197076482 2020-07-22 14:06:27 EDT <DreayWyven> @Xfinity how long is this outage ?
1285995615705538560 2020-07-22 13:50:22 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Amy, check the My Account app or web to track your service and find updates on the status through the duration of the outage.
1285985571584843778 2020-07-22 13:10:27 EDT <EarthAngel172> We had a small outage with Xfinity this morning (<50 homes impacted) and was lowkey excited and had hoped it would last all day. LOL
1285980053206073352 2020-07-22 12:48:31 EDT <DorksNxtDoor> Apparently they had like a state wide outage or something.
1285979232804515841 2020-07-22 12:45:16 EDT <manduhtory> There have been regular outages and outages due to a ‚Äútechnician performing maintenance‚Äù almost every day for 2 weeks now
1285978758646771713 2020-07-22 12:43:23 EDT <Xfinity> Are you experiencing outages in your area or having trouble with your WiFi connection?
1285968677943345153 2020-07-22 12:03:19 EDT <PayB_2> Lmao so it was an Xfinity outage last night and when I checked the Website these were some of the comments üòÇüòÇüòÇ  pic.twitter.com/jOo4gNPS0V
1285966424402526208 2020-07-22 11:54:22 EDT <montana0816> We can‚Äôt work from home with no services!! Y‚Äôall never put a live person on the phone it‚Äôs always fucking animated.  Power outage for 2 days straight and no live person to talk to it‚Äôs bullshit. I will be disconnecting my services and going to @theRCN
1285964942466846720 2020-07-22 11:48:29 EDT <Mr_DogTags> @Xfinity is there an outage in metro Atlanta?
1285963065075220482 2020-07-22 11:41:01 EDT <fijiDripin> What‚Äôs sup with all these outages @Xfinity like fr my WiFi wasn‚Äôt working until 8 this morning and I pay my bill consistently
1285958126315999232 2020-07-22 11:21:23 EDT <stephbaiocchi> I get that internet outages happen. It's especially hard now with so many people working from home. But @Xfinity @comcast estimating a 16 HOUR repair time is just insane!
1285957102469615616 2020-07-22 11:17:19 EDT <thereal_bbailey> Having a smart home is really cool up until there's an Xfinity outage and you can't even turn on the lights.
1285953045168361474 2020-07-22 11:01:12 EDT <Xfinity> You can always check your My Account app for info on possible outages. If you continue to have trouble, DM us at  https://xfin.tv/support¬† .
1285952536462016513 2020-07-22 10:59:11 EDT <T10Titan> Not that I know off my internet was off for 2 hours so i just fell asleep. I had outages for no reason before for a hour or 2. Often enough that I think all internet problems are at the fault of Comcast.
1285952386431963139 2020-07-22 10:58:35 EDT <lilbaloosik> Yes, there‚Äôs an outage in my area and throughout my whole building. It‚Äôs been reported multiple times in the past few days.
1285952155720056833 2020-07-22 10:57:40 EDT <gixxerfool> @Xfinity I‚Äôve had to reset my modem every morning for the past two mornings. Is there a known outage?
1285951533251809284 2020-07-22 10:55:12 EDT <Xfinity> Hey there. Are you experiencing outages or a trouble connecting through WiFi? We want to make sure your service is up and running so you can ace those finals.
1285949108172263436 2020-07-22 10:45:33 EDT <elysianalchemy> @Xfinity has had outages two days in a row for 20+ minutes like we don't RELY ON OUR CONNECTION FOR WORK.
1285947451963322370 2020-07-22 10:38:58 EDT <Mr_856> Ayo @comcastcares @comcastcares @Xfinity I pay wayyyyyyyyy too much money to have an outage EVERYDAY!! I‚Äôm tryna work and y‚Äôall fucking up the rotation. No cable and no internet the second day in a row! ü§¨ü§¨
1285945391352107009 2020-07-22 10:30:47 EDT <Xfinity> You aren't having any issues outside of the outages?
1285944708057964545 2020-07-22 10:28:04 EDT <bsrust> .. it‚Äôs almost like @comcast / @Xfinity time their outages .. just dropped my connection again .. yesterday it was 10:17 .. #youhaveonejob #uptime #uninterruptedaccessisadream
1285944563601780736 2020-07-22 10:27:30 EDT <T10Titan> Yes let me optimize and enhance almost state wide outages thank you automatic response.
1285943489826627595 2020-07-22 10:23:14 EDT <jconfo> @Xfinity @comcast @comcastbusiness thanks for the outages at my home and business office. Sure allows everyone to be productive on a Wednesday.
1285939169496186880 2020-07-22 10:06:04 EDT <jeg1129> Then Why have we struggled with wifi outages for the last 5 months when we are paying for the fastest service? Ridiculous! @Xfinity  https://twitter.com/Xfinity/status/1250892742206595080¬†‚Ä¶
1285925134562480129 2020-07-22 09:10:18 EDT <CochiLoco_JG> I woke up to everybody talking about a xfinity outage... well I switched to AT&T like 3 weeks ago üòÖ xfinity kept fuckin up my shit online
1285924735461863424 2020-07-22 09:08:42 EDT <Fawxli> Hey @Xfinity, how am I supposed to work with this outage?
1285876668897296384 2020-07-22 05:57:42 EDT <missinaaliyah> I don‚Äôt know about y‚Äôall but I‚Äôm expecting a big ass discount on my next @Xfinity @comcast @comcastcares bill with this ridiculous #outage #comcastoutage talk about bad business @ATT might be slow but it never didn‚Äôt work for hours at a time pic.twitter.com/ll7YYDdPXD
1285873527158190080 2020-07-22 05:45:13 EDT <T10Titan> @Xfinity trash connections and constant outages. Worst internet company out there.
1285856477773627392 2020-07-22 04:37:29 EDT <infernalG2> @Xfinity you owe me for this outage, I pay for time, you can‚Äôt keep up our internet you owe us.
1285847168893415424 2020-07-22 04:00:29 EDT <cassyhoneybee> @xfinity is going to get me fired one day üò≠ I work nights, at home, online.  The majority of outages I‚Äôve experienced are always during my work hours.
1285844852136120320 2020-07-22 03:51:17 EDT <KaialisBennings> Sorry there was an internet outage guys now. #Xfinity #Nashville #Tennessee

1285835321809219584 2020-07-22 03:13:25 EDT <Synqeo> comcast wifi went out but thanks to my unadulterated simping for artoria alter the outage just sorta stopped, eat my dick and taint and also balls xfinity
1285830581629181952 2020-07-22 02:54:34 EDT <cattybog> we have it after switching from Xfinity and I can't recall any major outages!
1285830388133265408 2020-07-22 02:53:48 EDT <ScoJo262> @Xfinity just gives 4 hour windows on their outages. They never give a true estimate.
1285828973000187905 2020-07-22 02:48:11 EDT <whitlockjc> My first week with @Xfinity and I am affected by an outage.  Now...I have to turn off my smart lights by hand, even with local WiFi up.  They don‚Äôt seem so smart anymore. #FirstWorldProblems
1285826617554743296 2020-07-22 02:38:49 EDT <Youarewonderful> Reeeeally thinking about switching to AT&T fiber after having an outage every night recently... @Xfinity

Ours went out at around 12:30AM and tons of additional outages are being added to the list.  üëÄNothing to see here #xfinity #comcastoutage #blackout
1285824283525120001 2020-07-22 02:29:33 EDT <saberchangobrr> Xfinity be like *$120 a month for mediocre internet speeds that i could achieve with another provider and daily outages in the middle of the night*
1285823565296795648 2020-07-22 02:26:42 EDT <saberchangobrr> xfinity be like *random outage at 12:22am and tells me nothing*

1285821029592555520 2020-07-22 02:16:37 EDT <Euraisa_Miluv> @Xfinity the kids here are wanting to know if y‚Äôall have people out working on the internet outage this time on night üò≠üò≠
1285820263653953538 2020-07-22 02:13:34 EDT <GrapeJuiceMe> Hey Comcast. I need to work. I can‚Äôt deal with an outage til 4:30am just cause y‚Äôall think we‚Äôre sleep @Xfinity
1285820099220447232 2020-07-22 02:12:55 EDT <nicetrybuster> Ode to @Xfinity  Can't believe how much we pay For random midnight #outages Are you really fixing something tirelessly Suddenly Affecting thousands In the dead of night Or are you fucking up my anniversary Because you're really a monopoly Acting like a commodity You guys suck
1285819675369242626 2020-07-22 02:11:14 EDT <kingmotivatorh> Lost internet about 45 min ago & found out Xfinity had an outage in our area covering 2,500 routers. Pop
1285819668180217857 2020-07-22 02:11:12 EDT <InkieSW> @Xfinity your shit is so broken that your account portal won't even take logins. East TN.  I've experienced some measure of outage, the worst being 4 hours, every other night for the last week. I am so close to swapping to WOW.. You didn't renew my contract so..
1285819525229838336 2020-07-22 02:10:38 EDT <RU_KlDDlNG_ME> @comcastcares  hey maybe you can help me fix my internet. The Xfinity app says there are no outages in my area, but I have no TV or internet
1285818837129211904 2020-07-22 02:07:54 EDT <neuroinvestbry> There‚Äôs always an outage with @Xfinity when I need it late at night. I promise you as soon as there‚Äôs an alternative I‚Äôm switching.
1285818530978398214 2020-07-22 02:06:41 EDT <MAGAChronicle> Massive xfinity internet outage as we speak. Nationwide.  pic.twitter.com/5hCp1YMoF6
1285817378715176961 2020-07-22 02:02:07 EDT <elkinsinbox> Unfortunately, do to an outage of my @Xfinity service, I will not be online. I will post updates if and where ever possible.
1285817218396229632 2020-07-22 02:01:28 EDT <xCheeno> @Xfinity I pay $260 a month for y‚Äôall to have an outage or ‚Äúmaintenance‚Äù every other day?!? Smh
1285816626366025730 2020-07-22 01:59:07 EDT <jjlongstocking> I did that and my screen went black....oh you have another outage. Maybe you should‚Äôve made your service better before blowing 100 mil on marxists.
1285815403290202114 2020-07-22 01:54:16 EDT <Hulen97> @xfinity You‚Äôre losing my business in the next few days. Random unexplained outage at 12:50 am. I‚Äôll gladly pay the early termination fee to get out of this trash. Terrible.
1285814985495662594 2020-07-22 01:52:36 EDT <garrettenorman> It‚Äôs interesting how often @Xfinity has an outage in my area these days.
1285814134043488256 2020-07-22 01:49:13 EDT <matt_lummus> @comcast @Xfinity @comcastcares Another night another outage. Literally the worst service provider
1285813900953485312 2020-07-22 01:48:17 EDT <RealBeel> @Xfinity outage in my area...will keep y‚Äôall posted on twitter as soon as things are back up and running.
1285813895974854656 2020-07-22 01:48:16 EDT <__lovecapri> So xfinity having a fucking outage..wtf
1285813782317420546 2020-07-22 01:47:49 EDT <AndrewCrow> I have made the biggest mistake by upgrading my @Xfinity service. Hours of tech support, multiple internet outages, equipment list in the mail, additional charges that contradict the sales pitch. Just unreal.
1285813621579288577 2020-07-22 01:47:11 EDT <ARandomBlackFox> @Xfinity hey if y‚Äôall could not have an outage every 2 days that would be üëåüèªüëåüèª
1285813139288793089 2020-07-22 01:45:16 EDT <t_weezii91> I swear xfinity have more outages than a mf. Tf I‚Äôm paying y‚Äôall for?
1285812841086439424 2020-07-22 01:44:05 EDT <jedijazzz> @Xfinity I‚Äôm really irritated at the amount of outages they‚Äôre having in my area for the price I pay for Internet!
1285812196279300097 2020-07-22 01:41:31 EDT <monty_sama> So Xfinity decided to have an outage while I‚Äôm streaming and in a Valorant comp game üòî
1285812176310198276 2020-07-22 01:41:26 EDT <__CaramelB> Xfinity pissing me off with this connection outage üòí they always got a fucking outage every damn week
1285812152918564864 2020-07-22 01:41:21 EDT <Hulen97> @Xfinity These random outages occur way too often out of nowhere get it together.
1285811732078878720 2020-07-22 01:39:40 EDT <kryalga> @Xfinity me and my friends normally cant get on together and everytime we can xfinity goes down from an outage why does this happen so much
1285811638910758914 2020-07-22 01:39:18 EDT <Rebirth187> one time I decide to watch TV Xfinity has a outage nice
1285804439002140672 2020-07-22 01:10:42 EDT <gxarevalo> Great, I was playing 2k and now Xfinity has an outage üò°
1285792690257289216 2020-07-22 00:24:00 EDT <CaliCravens> Nothing like a 15hr @Xfinity outage again today. What is that, 5 full day outages already this year? @9NEWS May want to look into how sharing a grid with the most expensive zip in DEN means outages last an hour. Now I share a grid with a poorer part of the city and they are 15hrs
1285790910526128130 2020-07-22 00:16:56 EDT <Kei_Breezy> I swear Xfinity stay having outages in my area... cable AND television
1285781724379541505 2020-07-21 23:40:26 EDT <alexiselizaa> @Xfinity needs to fix this internet outage already, I have movies to watch
1285771884005556225 2020-07-21 23:01:20 EDT <iFightGiants> Hey @Xfinity how is it that there has been an outage for the last hour but according to the app, I‚Äôve used 2 GB of data?
1285744306154876929 2020-07-21 21:11:45 EDT <nightstargazer1> @comcastcares I just signed up for xfinity WiFi three days ago and we‚Äôve had two outages today the first lasting several hours and the second still ongoing. This is terrible. I depend on WiFi for business purposes.
1285740276393349121 2020-07-21 20:55:44 EDT <JaggedEdgeAF> Not xfinity having a service outage rn.
1285735979802931201 2020-07-21 20:38:40 EDT <_JahniQuest> Outage 2000 people, went from being fixed this morning 7:30am to 11pm tonight.
1285732911694700546 2020-07-21 20:26:28 EDT <chrisofdoom3> @Comcast, @Xfinity, and @comcastcares, listen up.  My internet has been slow, then it wasn‚Äôt working at all. Is there an outage in my area? I would love to DM you my zip code, because I don‚Äôt want to reveal my location to the public. Please help me!  Go ahead, be slow, I‚Äôll wait!
1285724731153551362 2020-07-21 19:53:58 EDT <illumbinati> xfinity internet outage, I‚Äôve been staring at the ceiling for 3 hours
1285722321286836225 2020-07-21 19:44:23 EDT <tonkat5u> internet outage 5 days in a row @Xfinity ü§°
1285719072831873031 2020-07-21 19:31:29 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Bob, we're here to help. When these outages occur are there notifications about your service in the My Account app?
1285714718133542914 2020-07-21 19:14:10 EDT <Xfinity> We apologize for the frustration, are you in an area outage?
1285678826001924104 2020-07-21 16:51:33 EDT <Xfinity> We're sorry for the inconvenience the downtime has caused. Be sure to check the Xfinity My Account app for updates on the service outage.
1285677768320192512 2020-07-21 16:47:21 EDT <DiggsGriffin> @Xfinity so are y‚Äôall gonna like be on an outage for multiple days or what? Internet hasn‚Äôt worked for almost 12 hours.
1285676566094188544 2020-07-21 16:42:34 EDT <cynthiagmurillo> @xfinity this outage is gone on way too long. How are you planning to fix it? Should I call @ATT for help instead?
1285674859524231169 2020-07-21 16:35:47 EDT <Very_NESSAsary> I literally called XFinity complaining about not being able to watch my Christmas in July movies on Hallmark since there's an outage in my area ü§£
1285666550821912578 2020-07-21 16:02:46 EDT <Gr8PowerfulZan> The most frustrating part is having a recording tell me there's an outage, then trying to talk to the Xfinity Assistant that tells me there's not an outage reported, only to tell me I can schedule a call but still haven't recieved the one I scheduled yesterday. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1285665382485950469 2020-07-21 15:58:08 EDT <Xfinity> We apologize for the outages, we understand how important staying connected is. We're working to fix this ASAP.
1285664899507597312 2020-07-21 15:56:13 EDT <haleyabery> @Xfinity has had 2 outages during working hours today in my area. This is asinine! Internet service is essential for wfh right now and I need the internet in order to work! Why am I paying $80 a month if I can‚Äôt work!?!
1285641235290640385 2020-07-21 14:22:11 EDT <TatorChip1903> @Xfinity It says that there is an unplanned service outage in my area. You guys came out and fixed my internet in April and it has been working great until a couple days ago. Your team is always working on something that makes it go down. üò†
1285640208155906049 2020-07-21 14:18:06 EDT <dagee__> came back from lunch and Xfinity reported an internet outage. Thank you Jesus ü•∫
1285637530801643521 2020-07-21 14:07:27 EDT <DaveDizzle10> @Xfinity @comcast looks like there's an outage in West Seattle/98116, is there an anticipated time for resolution?
1285637083042914305 2020-07-21 14:05:41 EDT <iamchrisangles> It's happening in my condo in Broomfield, CO. My Note 9, iPhone XS Max, and iPad Pro all running the same speeds. Plus, @Xfinity went out too. I was having a difficult time loading even the outage maps for electricity.
1285635036193193985 2020-07-21 13:57:33 EDT <pawzprint> Another day, another @Xfinity outage ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1285622348884979712 2020-07-21 13:07:08 EDT <50Shades_AKAN> Nope it said no outages...I refreshed the system 2x and it started working... I‚Äôm my own support ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1285613494386200577 2020-07-21 12:31:57 EDT <WFHinSecurity> @Xfinity @comcast @comcastcares @comcastbusiness well, 1st major outage of the pandemic... out until 3pm (started at 10am). 5 hour outage - entire neighborhood is screaming üôÄ
1285612065579769856 2020-07-21 12:26:16 EDT <Xfinity> What's going on with your internet? Are you in an outage?
1285600027063341057 2020-07-21 11:38:26 EDT <Aaroneis> Apparently so. Damn! We had almost gone a whole month without an outage!
1285596243440406534 2020-07-21 11:23:24 EDT <Im_A_City_Boy> @Xfinity y‚Äôall said this outage would be resolved at 10:45am.  Still no internet so I‚Äôm still unable to work. Why is this happening multiple times a week in my area?
1285587470063722498 2020-07-21 10:48:32 EDT <sj_elle> I have 3 zoom meetings today and @Xfinity wants to have an outage that started last night at 2 am. Was supposed to be fixed by 4 am. Then that turned into 8am now they are saying 10am and I‚Äôm over it  pic.twitter.com/4lS1ls8Wz9
1285586762568536065 2020-07-21 10:45:43 EDT <LifeGaveyuLEMON> Xfinity power outage‚Ä¶problem solved  https://twitter.com/LifeGaveyuLEMON/status/1285572358795939841¬†‚Ä¶
1285578086273163264 2020-07-21 10:11:15 EDT <jayaho> Two things are certain with @xfinity internet outages: They will give you the most precise restoration estimates (2:49pm) and they will always be complete BS.  Each estimate is 8 hours later than the last.  Precisely to the minute.
1285576228771168256 2020-07-21 10:03:52 EDT <Im_A_City_Boy> Why are y‚Äôall having outages in the same exact area multiple times a week? I work from home.
1285573657524396033 2020-07-21 09:53:39 EDT <Im_A_City_Boy> Once again, @Xfinity is having another internet outage in my area. This is happening several times a week now.
1285569227714437121 2020-07-21 09:36:03 EDT <marmageek> Internet down both @ATTHelp and @Xfinity @comcastbusiness. #swfl #outage #internetdown

1285555186715549699 2020-07-21 08:40:15 EDT <thomaswikjr2> @Xfinity my internet is working, but the cable is out at my place on the southside of Minneapolis.  Is there an outage?
1285551210662031360 2020-07-21 08:24:27 EDT <RLXPRESS> @Xfinity I have been experiencing an outage in NE Denver since 12:30am. Is there a general outage in the Green Valley Ranch community?
1285549436735717376 2020-07-21 08:17:24 EDT <quick13> The @xfinity outage is not making mum happy this morning. I had @BBCWorld & @historychannel that's it. So now she is watching @HallmarkChannel recorded #ChristmasMovies.
1285547433435504640 2020-07-21 08:09:27 EDT <ughitsjennn> is there another xfinity outage of something

1285499874591547392 2020-07-21 05:00:28 EDT <Coreysister> `Xfinity know they wrong for this long ass outage!! I‚Äôm not paying my bill fuck them! & I wish they would cut my shit off!!! I‚Äôm calling corporate in the morning. I need a FULL credit on my bill!!! Or I‚Äôm switching my service
1285488209946800128 2020-07-21 04:14:07 EDT <YellieLately> @Xfinity halp please. How am I supposed to go down my pre-sleep YouTube rabbit hole if there‚Äôs an outage üò≠  https://twitter.com/YellieLately/status/1285487764633341953¬†‚Ä¶
1285486388922720256 2020-07-21 04:06:52 EDT <mrstealyourwig1> Y‚Äôall definitely giving me a credit @Xfinity .. all day it‚Äôs been an outage.. I had to use the hotspot on my phone to access Netflix
1285476237842898944 2020-07-21 03:26:32 EDT <portland_reddit> Comcast just went down across the entire PDX downtown core, if the xfinity outage map is to be believed.
1285466385167060993 2020-07-21 02:47:23 EDT <sj_elle> I‚Äôm so sick of @Xfinity and these power outages. I‚Äôve had a handful since March! Ridiculous
1285457801473597441 2020-07-21 02:13:17 EDT <1omgfetti> Gide damn @Xfinity another outage?!
1285449813325225985 2020-07-21 01:41:32 EDT <thatsnikki__> @Xfinity getting on my nerves with these outages latelyüôÑ
1285437085185388544 2020-07-21 00:50:58 EDT <miguelgorial> Imagine @Xfinity having a service outage every week, abolsule trash of a service
1285430673021505536 2020-07-21 00:25:29 EDT <ShawnP_300> I apologize for the sudden disconnect. Xfinity confirmed an outage in my area that won‚Äôt be resolved until early morning.
1285423662632333312 2020-07-20 23:57:37 EDT <len_vinas> @Xfinity @comcastcares why does my internet always go down? This is the 3rd time in 4 nights there has been an outage in my area
1285418872892542978 2020-07-20 23:38:35 EDT <_SmallsNoBiggie> I hate specturm. Old place, we had xfinity and the only problem we had was when the fiber started acting up but that was through the whole complex. But shit got fixed and we legit hardly ever had a problem (until an outage happened).
1285412452381921282 2020-07-20 23:13:05 EDT <alligator_ashes> I don't have/want the app. And what does it matter. You know where your outages are.y whole neighborhood has been have outages multiple times a day.
1285402990027968512 2020-07-20 22:35:29 EDT <bacardlbarbie> @Xfinity my internet has been out for over 13 hours. I can‚Äôt get any real person to actually talk to me. This is ridiculous. The outage was supposed to be fixed at 12:49... 9 HOURS AGO.
1285388090115330049 2020-07-20 21:36:16 EDT <Xfinity> Thanks for reaching out about this. Have there been outage updates for you in the My Account app?
1285385713790353409 2020-07-20 21:26:50 EDT <Dond205> @Xfinity what‚Äôs going on with you guys‚Äô Internet tonight #outage
1285374243329519618 2020-07-20 20:41:15 EDT <alligator_ashes> @Xfinity outages every frickin day in Palm Beach. Fix it or stop taking payments. Comcast is nothing but a bunch of crooks.
1285371654437306368 2020-07-20 20:30:58 EDT <Quartz0wl> I love how @XFINITY is still having issues with outages.. this is a bit annoying. I have school things I need to finish. üòí
1285364733349109762 2020-07-20 20:03:28 EDT <Xfinity> We're here to help, are you in another outage?
1285362101343653892 2020-07-20 19:53:00 EDT <StitesS> Hey @Xfinity @comcastcares... like clockwork- internet outage AGAIN. Can‚Äôt even get to a real person when I call in, even though I‚Äôve already reset the modem. The automated system hears itself talking and then hangs up on me.
1285359128592908288 2020-07-20 19:41:11 EDT <jevalentine5> @comcast @Xfinity what‚Äôs with the internet outage in ocean county N.J.?? It‚Äôs been hours
1285358993133776899 2020-07-20 19:40:39 EDT <TGN27> @Xfinity @comcastcares Hi, it's been more than 24 hours since the internet outage at Westland,MI. No update from you guys when it will get restored. #xfinity
1285349615148113923 2020-07-20 19:03:23 EDT <davidkiley> @Xfinity for the love of god will you fix the freaking outage in Dearborn MI
1285348950015381506 2020-07-20 19:00:44 EDT <Yemenia934> An outage since yesterday morning that keeps being extend every time they reach the ‚Äúestimated time‚Äù that it‚Äôs suppose to be back on.
1285347158154252288 2020-07-20 18:53:37 EDT <dowellvest> Yes. Yes it does. Along with the ‚Äúyour service will be back up at...‚Äù whatever arbitrary time only to see the outages continue to some other, later arbitrary time. Wednesday will be a week. With us all working from home, no wifi is an effort killer, to say the least.
1285339187529605120 2020-07-20 18:21:57 EDT <StephxRose> @comcast @Xfinity is there a known outage in Chicago right now? I don‚Äôt have an account to log into to check because it‚Äôs included in the rent of my building...
1285338534950428672 2020-07-20 18:19:21 EDT <whatthenicole> currently an outage in the neighborhood, but it‚Äôs still been iffy all week.
1285337161127145473 2020-07-20 18:13:54 EDT <Xfinity> Does the Xfinity My Account app list a service outage in the area?
1285333726302547968 2020-07-20 18:00:15 EDT <demond218> @Xfinity better get this outage fixed before #TheReidOut comes on!! Gotta give @JoyAnnReid some ratings!
1285326337926995970 2020-07-20 17:30:53 EDT <Xfinity> Oh no! Does the Xfinity My Account app list an area outage affecting your location?
1285321454276562946 2020-07-20 17:11:29 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Josh. Does the My Account app list a service outage?
1285314246218219521 2020-07-20 16:42:50 EDT <jrgray> These @xfinity outages in 60490 are getting out of hand.  One every week and weather is fine.  People are working from home @comcastcares. How about some better service??
1285306897625743363 2020-07-20 16:13:38 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Jim. Check your My Account app or  https://xfin.tv/3fNcnLA¬† -- if you're in an area outage, it will provide you with updates.
1285302781822164993 2020-07-20 15:57:17 EDT <arielnavaphoto> @Xfinity @comcastcares internet down. Reset modem twice. No reported outage in my area. Power cycled the modem. Still #nointernet üò§üò§üò§
1285302471804452865 2020-07-20 15:56:03 EDT <MikeSCohen> I switched to you guys fairly recently.  Good speed but the previous vendor did not have frequent outages.
1285301076728729606 2020-07-20 15:50:31 EDT <ShatienaD> @Xfinity second outage. Yesterday it was a 9hr outage. At least it was raining. Today one 30 min outage. Now they are talking about a 24hr outage. It‚Äôs not raining, or storming. You‚Äôre not satellite. Why does your tv and internet go out? At least with AT&T I had either or.
1285295408487501825 2020-07-20 15:27:59 EDT <ali_10_96> @Xfinity I've been without internet for the past two days now and your chat agents continue to tell me it was an unplanned outage. Unplanned outages don't take three days to fix. I'm working from home and have had to call off twice, do something.
1285291370106757123 2020-07-20 15:11:56 EDT <dlearout> Yes I look it up it said we have an outage do you know how long they are going to fix it I live in the Detroit Michigan area
1285289900246536197 2020-07-20 15:06:06 EDT <dlearout> My parents have the account information I loot up online of the outage map and it said it Wassint  available
1285288747366518784 2020-07-20 15:01:31 EDT <Xfinity> Hi. Have you checked your My Account app to see if you're in an outage?
1285286852715577345 2020-07-20 14:53:59 EDT <RealJoeyJabroni> Also have been told by @Xfinity that this was an ‚Äúunplanned‚Äù outage for the last four days, but after pressing the person I talked with today they said it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre upgrading to fiber in my area... it‚Äôs a planned outage... with no notification.
1285281798050766849 2020-07-20 14:33:54 EDT <v_green22> Another @Xfinity outage ? Are you kidding me right now
1285273724879396864 2020-07-20 14:01:49 EDT <jonacosto> wtf #xfinity  another outage?
1285273306141253637 2020-07-20 14:00:10 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked your My Account app? There may be an outage in your area.
1285260354289893376 2020-07-20 13:08:42 EDT <KimberliRichmo1> @Xfinity how the hell can I check power outage updates with no internet! What is the estimated time of repair? What the hell is going on?
1285254719267430400 2020-07-20 12:46:18 EDT <Jerold_Chinn> Anyone have Xifinity? Looks like a major outage in San Francisco right now. @Xfinity  pic.twitter.com/sGUAc5qMrP

1285250898554429440 2020-07-20 12:31:07 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Ashley. Does your My Account app indicate that you're in an area outage?
1285240720387956740 2020-07-20 11:50:41 EDT <TruCoreBD> Hearing of @xfinity and @Verizon large scale outage?
1285236221120253954 2020-07-20 11:32:48 EDT <Xfinity> Are you in an area outage?
1285233948394754048 2020-07-20 11:23:46 EDT <jpn> @comcastcares  I‚Äôm about done with xfinity. The network goes down almost every day. Sometimes for a couple minutes, sometimes for hours. The app says ‚Äúthere is no outage reported in your area‚Äù but it‚Äôs obvious it‚Äôs not just me, the neighbors xfinitywifi goes down too.
1285198885045108738 2020-07-20 09:04:26 EDT <Coreysister> `Xfinity got me fucked up! It was a WiFi outage in my area. Was supposed to be fixed by 6am! Now these muthafuckas talking bout 6pm. I‚Äôm switching my service! I never hear AT&T have outages.
1285031915813318656 2020-07-19 22:00:58 EDT <SporcleWithTim> I seem to live in one of the few local areas that still has power, but that does not mean we have internet.  I'd love to check the outage map, but my roommate is the account holder, so I don't have the account info, and for some reason it's not public info. @Xfinity @comcastcares
1285028597237977088 2020-07-19 21:47:46 EDT <rgm__69> @Xfinity internet outage in Philadelphia right now... common now!!!

1284935950464942082 2020-07-19 15:39:38 EDT <YaNanous> Looks like there‚Äôs an xfinity outage in my area and won‚Äôt be restored til 3am
1284912389041922048 2020-07-19 14:06:00 EDT <lduchin81> @Xfinity outages again after service problems a couple days ago. Is too much attention to Peacock affecting your customers?

1284689930908819456 2020-07-18 23:22:02 EDT <Average_SC> #xfinity man, constant outages for 7-18 hours. Internet shutting off 3:00 PM everyday is a real good way to rid of customers.
1284688193972035586 2020-07-18 23:15:08 EDT <Thekaoni> Guess I‚Äôm bout to face a blunt after I get out this shower and go to bed since the fucking WiFi has an outage in my area.  Xfinity count your mfkn days....

1284639749538553856 2020-07-18 20:02:38 EDT <97lion> @Xfinity why are we having so many issues with our internet connection?? We have some sort of outage almost once an hour at this point
1284638379821264897 2020-07-18 19:57:11 EDT <ChrisMo2413> Wanna know how I can tell there‚Äôs an xfinity outage in my area? The day of the week ends in ‚Äúday‚Äù.   üôÑüôÑ
1284601322285735937 2020-07-18 17:29:56 EDT <JoPaz> Comcast outage in Jefferson, Maryland. Any updates? @comcast @Xfinity
1284572256895553536 2020-07-18 15:34:26 EDT <eyesonfoxorg> So @comcastcares? After ~4 hours of no service they snuck in a silent update to their outage map (no notification sent). They‚Äôve removed an estimated time of repair. Currently it‚Äôs some time between now and infinity.   Is that where the @Xfinity name came from @Comcast? ü§£ pic.twitter.com/UYWFWXZUmr
1284563934977101829 2020-07-18 15:01:22 EDT <GringoFrom> @AtlanticBBInc been on hold over 35 min just to get a representative and your cable service & internet is out the past 2days. I wish I wasn't forced to get your service in my comples cause @Xfinity never had my service off for 3 days and on hold this long or had outages this bad
1284557085590663169 2020-07-18 14:34:09 EDT <pinescentedpoop> I feel his pain, I had to switch to Xfinity when I moved from harco to balco, but I will say it has for the most part been fine, outages are way more rare than they were when I had comcast in harco way back when
1284553875928887299 2020-07-18 14:21:24 EDT <M_perez949> @Xfinity you guys seriously suck. So many outages it‚Äôs unbelievable.
1284548859994284032 2020-07-18 14:01:28 EDT <barelyamericano> Verizon has been consistently good and reasonable and accommodating since I was in law school. As all my Xfinity friends and colleagues dealt with bullshit outages, I was sitting pretty through gaming, streaming, and all the sports channels I'd ever want.
1284548691500597248 2020-07-18 14:00:48 EDT <HM71208093> Xfinity outage in southwest miami going on 5 days - no updates or information on restoration of services - I wish had had another vendor to move to #horrible
1284535527052541954 2020-07-18 13:08:29 EDT <eyesonfoxorg> Sweet. So ~1 1/2 hours after I confirmed my @Xfinity internet outage I get a message from @Comcast they‚Äôre apparently starting to work on it.  My deepest apologies if my reporting it interrupted anyone‚Äôs nap time. üí§ pic.twitter.com/JnX24O6lvh
1284526534921871361 2020-07-18 12:32:45 EDT <LucasTrebe_7> Has anyone else been having internet Outages all week with xfinity ? @Xfinity
1284357302108160000 2020-07-18 01:20:17 EDT <TarHeelzCEO10> @comcastcares @Xfinity imagine having an outage and telling everyone it would be done within 8 hrs and its still not and now theres no timetable at all
1284352977923276800 2020-07-18 01:03:06 EDT <ionlytweetstuff> I had AT&T wifi for years back when I had UVerse. Now I have Xfinity and their constant outages.
1284319064387653632 2020-07-17 22:48:21 EDT <SoujaSam> Another night of bad service from @Xfinity. 3 days of outages in 2 weeks. I also can‚Äôt open a stream or play @FortniteGame for 30 minutes without losing connection. How much more can I take until I call @ATT
1284294575234977797 2020-07-17 21:11:02 EDT <marghie> Compared to what's happening in #Portland my @xfinity outage is a minor inconvenience. At least I had a metric crap ton of rollover phone data. The lab is turned in. #FinalsWeek #xfinityoutage #AtLeastWeDontThinkItsARevolution #ButItIsFlorida
1284294404908384262 2020-07-17 21:10:21 EDT <o2bandit66> @Xfinity how long do you expect this outage to last?  Need WiFi for certain things and tv out too?
1284293879835922437 2020-07-17 21:08:16 EDT <hanski72> @comcastcares @Xfinity @comcast why do you lie to your customers? One of my 3 boxes is not working. The other 2 are working fine. When I call your 800# I‚Äôm told ‚Äúthere‚Äôs an outage in my area. Where, in my living room? Give me a break...
1284293805752094725 2020-07-17 21:07:58 EDT <Dheavv23> Why Xfinity keep having outages üòí
1284292581560471552 2020-07-17 21:03:07 EDT <hanski72> @Xfinity one of the 3 set top boxes I pay for is not working. When I call I receive a message stating that there is an ‚Äúoutage‚Äù in my area that should be resolved in the next 3 hours. Everything else in my home is working, including my other set tops. Why does @comcast lie?
1284290809504903169 2020-07-17 20:56:04 EDT <havikcat> @comcast @Xfinity you guys good? We can‚Äôt seem to make it a week without a couple outages. It‚Äôs getting old. üôÑ
1284289942441603073 2020-07-17 20:52:37 EDT <woobackoliver> bro why does @Xfinity keep going down this is the second outage in the last week this is getting annoying where I have nothing to do but sleep all dayü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1284287943830654978 2020-07-17 20:44:41 EDT <Ashley63594776> Xfinity just had an outage anyone else wanna have an outage
1284285562619338754 2020-07-17 20:35:13 EDT <liciamorales> First it was the power surge, then an outage, then a new cable box, then Postmates went out, now xfinity has completely stopped working, like we can‚Äôt even report an outage. Oh... oh... okay
1284284400813764608 2020-07-17 20:30:36 EDT <DrexelHammond> There‚Äôs (another) outage with my @Xfinity service ‚Äî okay, stuff happens.  But there‚Äôs really NO excuse for not letting me watch recorded content in my DVR because the internet is down.  Just one of the many ways in which @comcast is evil.
1284281788974563328 2020-07-17 20:20:13 EDT <jessirabbit> so my @Xfinity internet is out... but the map claims they don‚Äôt have any outages..... and i‚Äôm not allowed to troubleshoot my modem i rent from them???? what the fuck  pic.twitter.com/jm8lR0jjpu
1284281440591654913 2020-07-17 20:18:50 EDT <kristenhewitt> How long for @Xfinity to fix the outage? Going on hour number 5....  Also, we are very spoiled.  #internetwithdrawl #internetdown
1284262143978663936 2020-07-17 19:02:10 EDT <Anhrez> The speed is fine but I have to reset my modem 2x week. The xfinity app (when I get an outage I check) tells me to do it, but never any insight on what could change so I do not have to keep doing it?
1284251431860686853 2020-07-17 18:19:36 EDT <BlissedCountry> I thought it was too cause Im so used to Xfinity dropping out and having outages.
1284246212292509698 2020-07-17 17:58:51 EDT <m_pyburn> @Xfinity @comcastcares My elderly parents have exhausted themselves trying to get attention for an xfinity outage since July 3rd. They had a tech in their duplex apartment on that day & no service since. Please let me know how we can speak to a real person for help in Memphis TN.
1284241238611365890 2020-07-17 17:39:05 EDT <seitensei> Maybe not, that's a highly coincidental outage on your end- your modem going down the same time that half the internet went down.
1284240421296775171 2020-07-17 17:35:51 EDT <seitensei> It's a Cloudflare outage, so anything using cloudflare is down.
1284240101929672704 2020-07-17 17:34:34 EDT <ndaught> @Xfinity @comcastcares Our internet is down in the middle of our work day. Just restarted modem/router without any luck. Not seeing any outages currently for our address...  pic.twitter.com/RY7I63KJV9

1284237295395254272 2020-07-17 17:23:25 EDT <LovelyCorrin> I guess my workday ended early? Xfinity outage.
1284224578403753985 2020-07-17 16:32:53 EDT <mangomantrap> My upload speeds are consistently below 0.70- and I'm on the 200/5 plan. I'm constantly experiencing outages in zoom meetings and other streaming activity even with no other devices on the netowrk
1284211132643893248 2020-07-17 15:39:28 EDT <kiqzhxr> xfinity outage lolololol
1284207429736001537 2020-07-17 15:24:45 EDT <YaaasRenee> Im so tired of Xfinity & their outages! Like why is there a outage every few weeks??
1284205000621789184 2020-07-17 15:15:06 EDT <AbouDi8181> No, i got a call that says we fixed the outage in your area and you moght not need the appointment this sunday but it is not fixed. Amd everytime i try to troubleshoot it doesn‚Äôt work it says tighten cables, unplug modem, and wait for the light. Not working

1284188125460402176 2020-07-17 14:08:02 EDT <BallNMyCOURT> I‚Äôm tired of Xfinity. Everyday there an outage in the area üòí
1284186616710537217 2020-07-17 14:02:03 EDT <DanInTheDC> @Xfinity - having a 4 hour outage when trying to work from home is not a great option. You need to share more details and do better.  pic.twitter.com/O1apPs4CE8
1284169064458465281 2020-07-17 12:52:18 EDT <nikki0319> This is awful.  @xfinity and @comcastcares you had a planned outage and you didn‚Äôt have the decency to share that information with our neighborhood.  As soon as there is another option for us we are switching.
1284167372455030784 2020-07-17 12:45:34 EDT <hopemaga> Xfinity Comcast, there's an outage in the Bay Area. Taking too long to be fixed. Why interrupt service to perform routine system maintenance during work hours from 07/17/2020 09:02 AM to 03:30 PM (Pacific)? One more time, stop outsourcing American jobs.
1284157824185106433 2020-07-17 12:07:38 EDT <_ExoticSilk> It‚Äôs official. I‚Äôm never getting @Xfinity ever again. I‚Äôm literally trying to make money and y‚Äôall wanna have an outage in the middle of the day. I‚Äôm over it.
1284149917011845120 2020-07-17 11:36:13 EDT <phillipsj73> Yep there is a published outage this time.
1284138651262296065 2020-07-17 10:51:27 EDT <Downg0esfrazier> @Xfinity I hope y‚Äôall taking some coins off my bill since y‚Äôall wanna play games and have an outage.
1284136859476647938 2020-07-17 10:44:20 EDT <DonDelillo69> @Xfinity @comcastcares thank you for ruining yet another morning and another day of work. I guess I‚Äôll have to change all of my plans for the day because of your shitty fucking company. Thanks for the outage üòò
1284136161036967936 2020-07-17 10:41:33 EDT <DonDelillo69> Anybody got a rope? Maybe a shotgun? Some cyanide capsules? I figure suicide is easier than getting @xfinity to provide reliable internet service. @comcastcares internet outages everywhere. Stop and smell the incompetence.
1284135272981176320 2020-07-17 10:38:01 EDT <DonDelillo69> Xfinity is a useless ISP. it inconveniences me more than it benefits. @comcastcares and the app are completely worthless. Outages in my town and, most likely, across country as normal. I guess I‚Äôm paying for the frustration?
1284134566152871936 2020-07-17 10:35:13 EDT <DonDelillo69> @comcastcares shit or get off the pot. Help me and give me answers or you can just shove whatever bullshit you tell me right up your asshole. Xfinity outage in Memphis. Every fucking month. Every fucking week. Every fucking day.
1284134027201597442 2020-07-17 10:33:04 EDT <DonDelillo69> Xfinity outage this morning? Anybody else enjoying the sweet, sweet rage flowing through your veins because of xfinity? The hate I‚Äôm feeling really compliments my coffee. @comcastcares @Xfinity
1284133588498251776 2020-07-17 10:31:20 EDT <DonDelillo69> @comcastcares Another xfinity outage in downtown Memphis Tennessee. Who else has an xfinity outage? Internet interruption by Comcast in TN once again. What the fuck!!!!!!!!!
1284133023571750913 2020-07-17 10:29:05 EDT <DonDelillo69> @comcastcares what in the actual fuck is wrong with xfinity? How the fuck does it go out this often? Give me money back. This is so fucking retarded. Memphis internet outage once a-fucking-gain! Seriously, what the fuck is wrong with this company?
1284124830795616256 2020-07-17 09:56:32 EDT <WooKAboutIt> Xfinity has another outage at my house. Like BRO WHAT THE FUCK
1284122304125911041 2020-07-17 09:46:29 EDT <helloimAL> Woke up to ANOTHER outage.... your service is horrible. @comcast @Xfinity
1284115838107357187 2020-07-17 09:20:48 EDT <StitesS> This issues have been going on for the last Several weeks. Nothing new on my end, it‚Äôs ‚Äúunplanned outages‚Äù in the area several times a week. Completely unacceptable, especially as a remote worker who relies on the Internet to get my job done.

1284020127495856129 2020-07-17 03:00:28 EDT <EldritchSyrup> Hey @Xfinity, I sure would appreciate if my internet didn't go down every night around midnight because of a "service outage". That would be neat. Thanks.

1283999463850119168 2020-07-17 01:38:22 EDT <kariwave> I guess I can file for damages in small claims court against @comcast since I have it in writing that I‚Äôve had 24 service outages in 3 months. I‚Äôll split the settlement (usually like 5k?) evenly between everyone who retweets this. Fuck you, @Xfinity. Eat my ass.  pic.twitter.com/JJNY1loM6w
1283992887240216576 2020-07-17 01:12:14 EDT <kariwave> So if you're wondering how long it takes for @Xfinity to admit that there's an issue -- that 24 outages in 3 months isn't normal -- remember that it's going to take you 23 hours to get their customer service reps to do that.
1283988262793682957 2020-07-17 00:53:51 EDT <NeedONliNEE> Wow an Outage. Now just can‚Äôt watch ANYTHING. üò† cable & internet just out. Way to go Xfinity!
1283985999811555328 2020-07-17 00:44:52 EDT <Ejoh15> Was really just so excited to start downloading Ghost of Tsushima, then @xfinity decided they wanted to have an outage... Man. Easiest way to get someone to hate a company.
1283985875223957506 2020-07-17 00:44:22 EDT <TylerBTV> xfinity has a outage every week bro
1283985742109212672 2020-07-17 00:43:50 EDT <Bitterman59> I had a friend with Comcast here in Michgan with repeated outages. Finally took a tech to do some pole troubleshooting. They found there were *two* switches on his block whereas the map only showed one. It was causing loopbacks and other problems. Unplugged one, problem solved.
1283978673058508801 2020-07-17 00:15:45 EDT <MarkW_E01> I‚Äôm gonna have to switch. I‚Äôm sick of getting my connection throttled every night and random outages with changing return to service timelines
1283974241721806853 2020-07-16 23:58:08 EDT <kariwave> My favorite part about @Xfinity is that they‚Äôre like ‚Äúis anything happening RIGHT NOW? otherwise we won‚Äôt do shit‚Äù even though they‚Äôve acknowledged that I‚Äôve had 24 outages in 3 months. 24 dropped zoom calls, 24 interrupted games of league of legends, 24 interrupted streams...  pic.twitter.com/0LNWNtyVZ0

At what point are you actually going to do something and fix this?
1283947149147828226 2020-07-16 22:10:29 EDT <RealPoliStan> @Xfinity outage in my area. Twice in 2 weeks. I work at home &  thank goodness I‚Äôm off work already.

1283880501053358090 2020-07-16 17:45:39 EDT <karalaralove> Once again I‚Äôm contacting @Xfinity because they hang up on me while I‚Äôm trying to schedule a maintenance worker to fix the outage issues that are occurring daily in our area. It‚Äôs very clear that @xfinity will give their customers the run around to avoid doing any work
1283877293262278656 2020-07-16 17:32:54 EDT <Not_Interesting> @Xfinity is there an outage in Medford ma?
1283869463440322560 2020-07-16 17:01:47 EDT <kumarraviii> Yeah. I was told the outage will be fixed yesterday itself. But its been going on for more than 48 hours now. And there have sporadic outages all through this month??? Why shall i be paying the internet bill for this month???
1283868159330508800 2020-07-16 16:56:36 EDT <kumarraviii> @Xfinity Are there any internet outages in DownTown San Jose area???
1283866721850462209 2020-07-16 16:50:54 EDT <Xfinity> Sorry for the downtime, are you seeing any outage completion info in your My Account app?
1283865882356330496 2020-07-16 16:47:34 EDT <jewlove_> If you got Xfinity and you‚Äôre internet went out call them to get a rebate on your account. They planned the outage...
1283864739932778497 2020-07-16 16:43:01 EDT <SamuelJVelarde> @Xfinity way too many outages in my area for a service i‚Äôm paying for ... 4 times in a month or 2 is insane ??

1283861800136646658 2020-07-16 16:31:20 EDT <dbabbyy> @Xfinity y‚Äôall been having too many outages lately to the point where I shouldn‚Äôt have to pay y‚Äôall this month üôÉ.
1283860178060943365 2020-07-16 16:24:54 EDT <JokerInTheBronx> Spectrum is hot garbage.  I've had Optimum for 15 years.  In that time, I've had 3 outages, none longer than an hour.
1283858319396880384 2020-07-16 16:17:30 EDT <kariwave> me: so you want me to pay YOU a monthly fee to be your contractor/receptionist/dispatch/on-site tech every time I have an outage? I had an outage on the 2nd and the 10th and last night. the month isn‚Äôt even halfway over. Can I please have a refund? Or an hourly wage? @Xfinity: no
1283848360571613185 2020-07-16 15:37:56 EDT <thegeenius> yea i smell lawsuits,, my dad's had this daily outage shit 5 times per day like clockwork since march- no amount of restarting is fixing the problem- gonna call your folks to come get equipment soon, & i'm waiting for you to charge us with any of it--
1283846838408245250 2020-07-16 15:31:53 EDT <themilana_> Xfinity got the nerve to ask me if I‚Äôm still in an outage HOURS after their trash azz service went out.  pic.twitter.com/Qglvmyfeua
1283834520052142081 2020-07-16 14:42:56 EDT <Xfinity> We know outages are frustrating and we work quickly to get everyone up and running. Check My Account web or app to track your service and find updates on your status.
1283832609961906178 2020-07-16 14:35:21 EDT <Xfinity> Hi William. Have you checked your My Account app to see if you're in an area outage?
1283827621059420161 2020-07-16 14:15:31 EDT <ogo_E> How can you have an internet outage in the middle of the work day @Xfinity ?????
1283822261225611264 2020-07-16 13:54:13 EDT <MrBeitzel> Becoming hard to prep for digital learning with @Xfinity outages every day.
1283821836501909506 2020-07-16 13:52:32 EDT <RonSwansonite> @comcastcares @Xfinity @comcast my comcast internet service has been completely unacceptable for over a month now. Outages and massive slowdowns almost daily. Some people are relying on their home internet for their employment. GET IT TOGETHER.
1283820814589145090 2020-07-16 13:48:29 EDT <Xfinity> We apologize for this happening, are you in an area outage?
1283818567889063937 2020-07-16 13:39:33 EDT <eric1199s> @Xfinity we have outages without warnings. My jobs 100% online and the service is interrupted so many times. Worst you don‚Äôt have any way to reach a customer don‚Äôt care agent. ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ we pay for a service. I do understand outages but this is not excepable. üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°
1283818077277257729 2020-07-16 13:37:36 EDT <ThePhatcyde> @Xfinity why the fuck does it take OVER an hour to reach a person? Why can‚Äôt you coordinate with your app & phone system so it can already be documented I‚Äôve troubleshooted my modem now NINE times and I still can‚Äôt report an outage DESPITE THE FACT YOUR APP SAYS THERE IS ONE  pic.twitter.com/AkJN9vqdz6
1283794617876570119 2020-07-16 12:04:23 EDT <potus613> Xfinity Outage in northeast
1283792756293459968 2020-07-16 11:56:59 EDT <RealWishKhalifa> @Xfinity internet is out, attempts to look up outage map to find out the details, must be signed in to view outages, go to sign in, must reset password to sign in, attempt to reset password, must be connected to home internet in order to do so... üò§
1283790070881845248 2020-07-16 11:46:19 EDT <mscott92> And good ole @Xfinity has an unplanned outage in the middle of the work day. This is so unacceptable, and happens a few times a month! SMH ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüò°üò§ get it together!
1283774792206884865 2020-07-16 10:45:36 EDT <ericmckeon> @comcastcares is there an Xfinity outage in the Northampton MA area? Been down for 30 minutes here...
1283769076192608267 2020-07-16 10:22:53 EDT <thegrreatpsycho> @comcast @comcastcares @Xfinity  Are you kidding ? Outage since yesterday evening and estimated time of resumption of service has been changed thrice already. 1:40 AM‚Äî->> 9:22 AM ‚Äî>> 1: 12 PM. Are you even working to fix the issue?
1283768605688070145 2020-07-16 10:21:01 EDT <nmayes03> Here‚Äôs a shocker. Our @comcast @Xfinity service is down...again...until 4:30.  This happens almost weekly. Great ‚Äúlightening fast service‚Äù as we struggle to work from home.  Outages like this force my wife to burn her ‚Äúsick days‚Äù since she can‚Äôt work.  Garbage service.
1283759871196909574 2020-07-16 09:46:19 EDT <DiamondSAYS_> @Xfinity y‚Äôall been fucking up the WiFi in my area since yesterday. Where are these ‚Äúoutages‚Äù coming from? Myself, as well as many others, can‚Äôt work from home if the connection goes out every few hours üôÑ
1283759808575868928 2020-07-16 09:46:04 EDT <theartfultechie> Why are there so many outages @comcast @Xfinity @comcastcares?!? Everyone working from home needs a reliable connection to get work done!
1283759235034120193 2020-07-16 09:43:47 EDT <_Sirxch> I just checked to be sure, notifications are enabled on the app. I received no ping, blip or boop saying that we would be facing planned maintenance outage.
1283756068527648769 2020-07-16 09:31:12 EDT <JavelinAddict> @Xfinity I never thought my first tweet is complaining: I've got many friends including myself in 60607 area experiencing cable internet service outage, starting from around 15 July 10pm. And the service is not back till now. People are trying to work from here!
1283753804714913793 2020-07-16 09:22:12 EDT <Xfinity> Be sure to check the Xfinity My Account app for updates on the outage.

1283684442087870464 2020-07-16 04:46:35 EDT <JGKman40> @Xfinity Outage
1283668976514535424 2020-07-16 03:45:08 EDT <MJMahoneyIII> Good because in Jacksonville Deercreek area we have been suffering an outage for over 12 hours.   @xfintiy doesn‚Äôt mean high availability.
1283668665137848325 2020-07-16 03:43:53 EDT <MJMahoneyIII> @Xfinity outage of over 12 hours and counting on the Jacksonville Deercreek area.   So much for high availability architecture.
1283656183879020544 2020-07-16 02:54:18 EDT <mscott92> These seemingly random @Xfinity outages are not the tea when so much depends on internet these days. Ugh I wish there were more ISP options around here.
1283646888852500480 2020-07-16 02:17:21 EDT <downtowndyke> @xfinity @comcastcares The internet has been in and out for almost two weeks now, and every time I tell you there's an outage in my area you deny it.  It's now been out for over a day and you still say nothing is wrong even though it shows on the app.
1283646047865180160 2020-07-16 02:14:01 EDT <JonathanRaps_> If Xfinity has one more outage I‚Äôm throwing my router
1283645473350352896 2020-07-16 02:11:44 EDT <Mohlwein> @Xfinity raises my price and then goes out when I get off work and want to use it? That‚Äôs fine, I didn‚Äôt need it for communication with some people. #outage
1283640265400623105 2020-07-16 01:51:02 EDT <jr_wohlford> Oh hey look, more problems with my @Xfinity internet. Over a year with 0 problems and we‚Äôve had 4 outages within the last couple months üôÑ
1283635883703492610 2020-07-16 01:33:38 EDT <Hulen97> A random @Xfinity outage at 12:30 am. Gotta love it. How does that even happen...
1283617243830648832 2020-07-16 00:19:34 EDT <alt_tag> Hey, @Xfinity @comcastcares , maybe doing ‚Äúroutine maintenance‚Äù and killing internet access unannounced at night on tax day wasn‚Äôt the brightest idea.   6-hour planned outage?! Gimme a break. Or at least pro rata.  pic.twitter.com/ttVnONgkuV
1283615440984518656 2020-07-16 00:12:24 EDT <sporrofn> two xfinity internet outages in one day multiple hours with no internet i actually cannot wait to get at&t fiber
1283588329464909830 2020-07-15 22:24:40 EDT <IrishTechno> @Xfinity  you‚Äôre making working from home IMPOSSIBLE outages every few hours and customer support says there‚Äôs nothing they can do. It‚Äôs getting to the point my boss isn‚Äôt believing me- write me an excuse?
1283578227236188161 2020-07-15 21:44:31 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Ed. The Xfinity My Account app will provide info for any area service outages, so be sure to check there.
1283577925892268038 2020-07-15 21:43:19 EDT <Xfinity> We apologize for this downtime, are you still finding yourself in an outage?

1283403535367966720 2020-07-15 10:10:21 EDT <capitalathedj> Xfinity outage?
1283379065936846849 2020-07-15 08:33:08 EDT <Its_Just_Jordyn> . @Xfinity said ‚Äúwe know you‚Äôre working from home, so we‚Äôre going to give you more outages than normal!‚Äù üòí
1283375458495725569 2020-07-15 08:18:47 EDT <Im_Spoiledddd> @Xfinity when is the outage going to end? at first y'all said at 10:04 PM lastnight, I wake up to check now y'all saying 8:00 AM today ü§î .
1283374202536566795 2020-07-15 08:13:48 EDT <tisharesabi> I am very disappointed with my Xfinity service. I have never had such a bad experience with the service. More outages and passive  increase in fees. In the past I wouldn‚Äôt have minded paying for quality but I‚Äôve had nothing but shitty service. Shameful! üò°#Comcastcares
1283344586413240320 2020-07-15 06:16:07 EDT <y2kaleb> @comcast @Xfinity when the fuck is this outage gonna end i got shit to do man!!!!!! n then the comcast/xfinity site requires the acc info just to see the outage map and updates, knowing damn well probably >50% of the ppl using their internet dont have the login for the house acc
1283322522671484928 2020-07-15 04:48:27 EDT <Josh_BKNY> @Xfinity outage.. again..   "We began work on 07/15/2020 03:29 AM (Central), and this is expected to end 07/15/2020 06:00 AM (Central)."  its time you lower your prices. this is getting rediculous.
1283285378821128192 2020-07-15 02:20:51 EDT <ayunemi> @Xfinity why is there always an outage? and my internet everyday around 3am cuts off? explain pls
1283285048259682304 2020-07-15 02:19:32 EDT <AlexJBragg> Yo @Xfinity thanks for letting me know about an outage occuring in my area after the internet cut out and cable doesn't work anymore. I appreciate the heads up after everything suddenly stopped working.
1283278772800589824 2020-07-15 01:54:36 EDT <denica> I think it‚Äôs just that Xfinity internet is ass for the constant outages
1283275986717544448 2020-07-15 01:43:32 EDT <Chris_shredz> Just when I was about to reach Diamond again for ranked split 2 #apexlegends theres ANOTHER ‚Äúunsuspected‚Äù outage from @Xfinity . That‚Äôs like the 3rd time in a couple weeks. üòí
1283264741964681216 2020-07-15 00:58:51 EDT <kelgriffeyjr> Smh @xfinity and this weak outage outta nowhere got me missing deadlines at work. They must gone hire me if i get fired ü•¥
1283253653688725504 2020-07-15 00:14:47 EDT <Czah3> Xfinity always treated me right and always kept me posted about outages and didn't have them for no reason other than normal heavy storms.

1283240271459823616 2020-07-14 23:21:36 EDT <_SimplyKyra_> T-mobile is carrying metro and sprint on its back so the internet is trash, xfinity is having an outage. My life is so ghetto right now.

1283225781561425930 2020-07-14 22:24:02 EDT <WillDrinksCofee> Cody got a notification about an outage in our area this morning, which is strange, because we're fine here. Their messaging is so strange.
1283224106431848448 2020-07-14 22:17:22 EDT <_aliccciaa> I tried troubleshooting it and it‚Äôs saying that there‚Äôs an outage in my area, they‚Äôre working to resolve it by 11:43. Thanks for trying to help though, hopefully it actually comes back by then because I have work to finish online.
1283214559000633344 2020-07-14 21:39:26 EDT <tamika_coco> "An XFINITY Internet outage has been reported in your area. We're working hard to get your service up and running. The issue will be resolved 07/14/2020 08:06 PM (Eastern). Thank you for your patience."  As you can see it's well past 8:06
1283211453839880192 2020-07-14 21:27:06 EDT <_Kimarialynn> I‚Äôm real salty about this xfinity outage .
1283209472605925377 2020-07-14 21:19:13 EDT <Jsims217> Xfinity on that unacceptable been an outage in my area since 6:30 can‚Äôt even hop on the game.
1283193788966539265 2020-07-14 20:16:54 EDT <1BAD_adDiXSHON> The one day I remembered to watch green leaf there is an xfinity outage in til 11pm. Looks like I‚Äôm going to bed early tonight.
1283186915227897856 2020-07-14 19:49:35 EDT <tmurph893> I can‚Äôt access Netflix or Hulu as I have no internet and their site claims no reported outages in my area. How can we report it when the bot is just as clueless as their employees?
1283179671820148743 2020-07-14 19:20:48 EDT <loridenzler> @comcast @Xfinity  WORST SERVICE EVER! Has been this way for 3+ weeks!! My whole neighborhood is down AGAIN!! Call and get the SAME BS! Told no outage is reported but 100 or more of my neighbors are down too!  Schedule appt. Tech comes only checks 1 house when 100 or more r out
1283178809597071361 2020-07-14 19:17:23 EDT <BasedLordK> Fam the XFinity has a WiFi outage, why these niggas talking about It‚Äôll be resolve by 10 üòê

1283149183260688392 2020-07-14 17:19:39 EDT <luciano_asg> @Xfinity @xfinitymobile I'm very unsatisfied with your service, I'm waiting for the whole day. I have outage issues in my area 33145 every week since I moved. The mobile service is another shit, I'm trying to use the hotspot, but it isn't working too.
1283146569672425472 2020-07-14 17:09:16 EDT <Im_Spoiledddd> Xfinity is having an outage again ü•±
1283144658839887879 2020-07-14 17:01:40 EDT <KP_Trill> So over this Xfinity outage.
1283139873973698560 2020-07-14 16:42:40 EDT <LucasTrebe_7> Why are you having so many outages? @Xfinity
1283134667995127809 2020-07-14 16:21:58 EDT <mckrizzy2> Pay good money for @Xfinity internet and what do I get in return? Outages every day, constant connection issues, generally suckiness.   Really convenient when you work from home.
1283133866505535489 2020-07-14 16:18:47 EDT <nos3um> Better get used to outages daily
1283132673385521157 2020-07-14 16:14:03 EDT <alextoldyou> Yes, and the outage occurred at 9:50 this morning. Fix it. ü•∫
1283131945388584962 2020-07-14 16:11:09 EDT <Xfinity> Hey. Does the Xfinity My Account app list an area outage?
1283123070635511809 2020-07-14 15:35:53 EDT <LitheLemur> @comcastcares  The Xfinity Outage map showed an outage in my area 3 days in a row, all 3 times of which it was supposedly resolved by a set time. 2 days later my speeds are almost a tenth of what they usually are. Do I call customer support?
1283122860035366914 2020-07-14 15:35:03 EDT <LitheLemur> @Xfinity Outage map showed an outage in my area 3 days in a row, all 3 times of which it was supposedly resolved by a set time. 2 days later my speeds are almost a tenth of what they usually are. Do I call customer support?
1283114054349987840 2020-07-14 15:00:04 EDT <NetworkRakurai> Oh good, Xfinity is having an outage AGAIN.
1283113934640173056 2020-07-14 14:59:35 EDT <gwilliamsr> @xfinity when is the outage in 95136 area going to be restored?
1283110987604819970 2020-07-14 14:47:53 EDT <SparkSeekerrr> @Xfinity you guys are seriously the WORST! Area wide outages every single week 2 months running.... enough is enough. It‚Äôs a shame consumers don‚Äôt have an SLA to protect us. If we did, I‚Äôm sure you would get your act together.
1283109642357411842 2020-07-14 14:42:32 EDT <ChaLoveRose> There‚Äôs always an Internet outage w xfinity üòí
1283105846763892737 2020-07-14 14:27:27 EDT <matthewreed26> @Xfinity this is the 3rd time an #outage has occurred in my area of #dc in the past 5 days and right in the middle of my work day. What is the meaning of this?! #fixyournetwork
1283104018168983554 2020-07-14 14:20:11 EDT <csiegel19> Hey @Xfinity my WiFi has been out due to service outages for now my third day in a row! It was restored this morning around 8:30 and now it‚Äôs out again for another 4.5 hours.   Can someone let me know why I keep having outages? Sunny weather...
1283103517994082305 2020-07-14 14:18:12 EDT <Ltpietrzak> It was but has since come back on. I would like to request a refund for the 12 hour outage earlier this week and today‚Äôs brief outage
1283103206860566530 2020-07-14 14:16:58 EDT <Xfinity> Oh no. Does the My Account app show an area outage?
1283099377192632321 2020-07-14 14:01:45 EDT <Xfinity> We apologize for the constant outages, we understand staying connected is important. Are you in an outage currently?
1283098935813378048 2020-07-14 13:59:59 EDT <RhondelleL> I wonder if we can sue @Xfinity for the lost wages for all these damn power outages in my area! I had lost money last month due to one and again this month due to another! How frustrating
1283098166561083392 2020-07-14 13:56:56 EDT <tmarman> We had Xfinity Gigabit and it was unbearable. 45 sec outages every few mins (proved with netcaps) and atrocious upload speeds.   Multiple tech visits couldn't solve the problem, so they let us cancel. Not that it helps you, but AT&T Fiber has been mostly amazing.
1283096633714962433 2020-07-14 13:50:50 EDT <michaeldecook> @xfinity service is unacceptable, planned obsolecence is unacceptable, @comcastcares customer service is unacceptable, unable to report/fix outages for weeks. When will @FCC and @AjitPaiFCC step in on the consumer‚Äôs behalf and demand change? #comcastoutage #comcastoutrage  /END
1283092363116773376 2020-07-14 13:33:52 EDT <michaeldecook> Three weeks in and I‚Äôm already regretting the 2 year contract I just signed with @Xfinity to upgrade to their gigabit service.  Since the pandemic started they have made it near impossible to:  1. Contact customer service 2. Report issues/outages 3. Get any resolution.  1/
1283091480601595906 2020-07-14 13:30:22 EDT <KurteL10> I‚Äôve had connection issues for year. I need a tech to come out again, but I don‚Äôt want anyone costing during a pandemic. I have learned to deal with random outages throughout the day.
1283078960688115713 2020-07-14 12:40:37 EDT <YTEssentialBuss> @Xfinity y‚Äôall need to get your crap together. I crash daily, 2 ‚Äúoutages‚Äù in my area in a row, constant lagging with 1 device connected with an Ethernet cable. Y‚Äôall supposed to be the best internet but you‚Äôre definitely the worst I‚Äôve EVER had. I‚Äôd be better of using a hotspot

1283062635957805056 2020-07-14 11:35:45 EDT <Im_A_City_Boy> Everyday @Xfinity has been having internet outages in the same area. Come on man
1283049165304541184 2020-07-14 10:42:13 EDT <Xfinity> Hey. Have you checked your My Account app to see if there's an outage in your area?
1283029328620662785 2020-07-14 09:23:24 EDT <nashvillefatboy> Going into our 72nd hour without. Says  8:57 on outage map but the timeline has moved so many times it‚Äôs mind numbing.
1283029159472660483 2020-07-14 09:22:43 EDT <_Alejandro_Suar> Xfinity decided to go through an outage in the middle of my Psych exam ü•¥
1283021323619401728 2020-07-14 08:51:35 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked the My Account app for outage info?

Half the shows gone (not in recently deleted file) are now available for pay only. Most were last episodes. Have also experienced 6 outages of phone, cable & internet since 2 June!

1282836501580177409 2020-07-13 20:37:10 EDT <ychaker> looking at search results for "outage" on @Twitter  it seems that quite a few companies are suffering. @Ask_Spectrum @Xfinity @CoxHelp all have customers complaining of outages, as well as some utilities companies in areas of TX. what a Monday, hunh?
1282834824764379137 2020-07-13 20:30:30 EDT <DRediske> When you‚Äôve been effectively offline for 4 hours, but @xfinity says there‚Äôs no outage and that I should try restarting the router for the 10th time... there‚Äôs probably an outage.
1282827338942685184 2020-07-13 20:00:46 EDT <LittleFootLady> Second night in a row the internet goes out.   @comcast @Xfinity says it'll be back on at 11:52 pm EDT  What is really going on that I've the same outage 2 nights in a row.
1282824130358738944 2020-07-13 19:48:01 EDT <neon_ness> Thank you. Don‚Äôt have the app. Went to Xfinity, was asked to do a modem restart. In another development, keep getting asked to return Xfinity modem; have been using my own modem for several years! Wondering if the connection has something to do with that? Unless, outage?
1282822251838967809 2020-07-13 19:40:33 EDT <FRQ360> Xfinity / Comcast have way too many outages to be raising up the price for their service and not having the decency to compensate at least once. Anyone recommend a different service?
1282814703073468418 2020-07-13 19:10:33 EDT <SSKawar> Hello @Xfinity. There are no service outages. I was finally answered and am being sent a new modem after several restarts to my current one. I hope this works ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫  pic.twitter.com/VTJQA6Mw4k

1282797183901679616 2020-07-13 18:00:56 EDT <thaddeusq> It should, however it didn't show any outages until after I tweeted!
1282796723623137281 2020-07-13 17:59:06 EDT <GardenOfExen> @Xfinity I checked and there were no outages near me
1282790495220125703 2020-07-13 17:34:21 EDT <pawzprint> Another prolonged @Xfinity outage, looks like they would prorate bills when this occurs. At least send a free refrigerator magnet ???
1282790224083419137 2020-07-13 17:33:17 EDT <JosEduardoNR> @Xfinity What is happening ? Two days with a outage!
1282788001786015744 2020-07-13 17:24:27 EDT <Reptilligator> @Xfinity National intetnet service outages make it difficult to work online during a pandemic. 5mbps down and total disconnects every 5 seconds here. "Up to gbit speeds", you advertise, for 300$/mo with cbl and gbit internet. You have the resources to solve this problem. Fix it.
1282783546466283521 2020-07-13 17:06:45 EDT <wordsofnakia> Dear @Xfinity do you realize people are working from home? This outage every other day sucks!!
1282781555614720000 2020-07-13 16:58:50 EDT <Xfinity> Are you in an area outage?
1282779246482653190 2020-07-13 16:49:39 EDT <anarchyqueer> I can understand and sympathize with service outages, but this is a *consistent* problem.
1282770547974144000 2020-07-13 16:15:06 EDT <hkstinnett> It‚Äôs area outages. Not my equipment. The app and phone calls to Xfinity confirm that it‚Äôs the area, not a problem on my end. Almost every day, for weeks.
1282756368810704896 2020-07-13 15:18:45 EDT <ScreamoDucky> Fuck Xfinity and your fake ass ‚Äúinternet outages‚Äù

1282730144189145089 2020-07-13 13:34:33 EDT <samihah> Why is @Xfinity incapable of providing reliable internet? There‚Äôs an outage at least 3 times every 4 weeks.   Now taking recommendations for reliable internet in SF.

1282722574942834690 2020-07-13 13:04:28 EDT <brandonfosterwv> First I get a message to say my service has been restored after not having it for roughly 36 hours. Only to come back and find out their is another ‚Äúoutage‚Äù. @Xfinity. You guys are a joke.
1282711716271357952 2020-07-13 12:21:19 EDT <HeelChad> Me: every time an outage happen at a random time üôÉ @Xfinity fuck you yired if you shit  pic.twitter.com/8Se8HO0uEi
1282708635462914049 2020-07-13 12:09:04 EDT <StephTheBlogger> Nothing like an unplanned @Xfinity outage while trying to work from home. Husband was in middle of a big presentation when it went out. üòí
1282704614928846848 2020-07-13 11:53:06 EDT <PlazolaSergio> @Xfinity I‚Äôve been having outages in my area almost every day for the last 3 weeks! You guys need to figure this out. I‚Äôm a teacher and my class keeps getting interrupted. This is not ok. I‚Äôm paying for a service that I‚Äôm not receiving!
1282692867912355840 2020-07-13 11:06:25 EDT <Xfinity> When you say outages, is your My Account app showing an area interruption? Or is there an issue with your equipment?
1282692409319555072 2020-07-13 11:04:36 EDT <hkstinnett> Yes. I want to know why these outages keep happening and when we can expect them to stop. I‚Äôd like my bill adjusted. Most of all, I just want consistent service. We need to work.
1282669999967133697 2020-07-13 09:35:33 EDT <kateegeorge> @comcastcares @Xfinity my internet has been out for the last 24 hours. I got a text at 8am saying it was fixed and now my app says there‚Äôs an outage again. I can‚Äôt get to a human by calling, can someone please help me?
1282666005488115712 2020-07-13 09:19:41 EDT <Ale_3_A> @Xfinity please fix the outage in my area. I‚Äôm working from home and having to use my cellphone‚Äôs hotspot. Thanks  pic.twitter.com/ank5CMyJj4
1282660930447380482 2020-07-13 08:59:31 EDT <Xfinity> It's possible that an outage affected your area. Let us know if you need anything else!
1282653785953906689 2020-07-13 08:31:07 EDT <marg__xx> Yes and it has showed interruptions since early yesterday morning and the resolution time has changed several times. How long does it take to fix an outage?
1282572631477297152 2020-07-13 03:08:39 EDT <datagoon> Second @Xfinity outage in less than 4 days.
1282552091412557824 2020-07-13 01:47:01 EDT <csolis28> Xfinity outage in my area üòë Glad I did my hw earlier today
1282538362692415494 2020-07-13 00:52:28 EDT <pinky52705> Great an @Xfinity service outage and I have work in the am and need my internet service for classes.
1282521077885927425 2020-07-12 23:43:47 EDT <AMERICA37205525> @Xfinity Gotta love this high tech high price service!  Their is an outage and rather than admit an issue they say, plug and unplug your connection and check cables. Really. Are we that stupid?  Why do I pay these high cable bills??
1282518996382674944 2020-07-12 23:35:31 EDT <MrRichardWeaver> @comcastcares @Xfinity @comcast we have been trying to get support for intermittent internet for over a week, now we are in a prolonged outage and your phone tree runs in loops, representatives are not adequately prepared. Please Help ASAP!
1282494266871361538 2020-07-12 21:57:15 EDT <_danalvarenga> Anyone else having an xfinity outage??
1282481059796525057 2020-07-12 21:04:46 EDT <HeelChad> @Xfinity why why why do you guys continue to lie lie lie about what‚Äôs going why people like myself are having all of these outages! It‚Äôs a damn shame you that you can‚Äôt get the proper help you need to resolve the issue because it‚Äôs always a bit telling you the same lies and bs
1282466071962718209 2020-07-12 20:05:13 EDT <GrandmaJesusTTV> for about a week. you guys keep saying there is outages but its inconsistent.
1282464701058650112 2020-07-12 19:59:46 EDT <hkstinnett> Two more outages today so far! More phone calls and zero humans to talk to me. I managed to get someone on the chat, but just when I got to them, another outage! Couldn‚Äôt get the chat to work when service was back. It‚Äôs like a joke. @Xfinity
1282442980197126144 2020-07-12 18:33:27 EDT <Xfinity> We apologize for the outage, are you seeing any updates in your My Account app?
1282422595858477056 2020-07-12 17:12:27 EDT <HarryCutts> I already contacted support, but they would only talk about the current outage and not the general problem. My ZIP code's 94043.
1282422423380533251 2020-07-12 17:11:46 EDT <_jennif_> Bruh there would be a XFinity outage in the area when I‚Äôm trying to do my schoolwork üôÑ

1282399773446885377 2020-07-12 15:41:46 EDT <DKShaner1> @comcast @Xfinity @comcastcares tv has been out for hours, you guys say no outage in area but there was and it‚Äôs been fixed. Yet I‚Äôm seeing reports the entire north East is damn near out. I‚Äôve reset system 100xs. Are you guys working on it? I don‚Äôt want to be on phone for an hr
1282398633946517506 2020-07-12 15:37:14 EDT <HarryCutts> @Xfinity What's happening with the outages in Mountain View? We've had 7 so far this month. What's causing them, and when will it be fixed?
1282390947188236288 2020-07-12 15:06:42 EDT <PoojaGoswami05> @Xfinity @ComcastCares For past few weeks,our neighborhood has faced xfinity outage almost every otherday. Sometime,even every day. Each time outage last for 4+hours & despite 20+ outages in last 2weeks, no permanent solution has been done. It is now impossible to work from home.
1282385144842612737 2020-07-12 14:43:38 EDT <alexanderhminer> @Xfinity why am I paying for your 1000mbps package when you can't even keep our connection at 50mbps? Daily Constant outages, useless customer service, and just an overall bad experience. #xfinitysucks
1282378253345460224 2020-07-12 14:16:15 EDT <proactiff> Xfinity @Xfinity have nerve to be experiencing an entire neighborhood outage until 4:46. At least that could have made it 4:20 or 4:44.  pic.twitter.com/93SGytX37N
1282374260854386688 2020-07-12 14:00:23 EDT <amarkrishna> It‚Äôs been 4 days since no internet. @ATT showed it‚Äôs true incompetence in handling this. Horrible customer service. @comcast @Xfinity time to make a move. Will you guys step up and help me out in San Mateo area. #outage #att #internet
1282370440883822597 2020-07-12 13:45:13 EDT <Xfinity> We apologize for the constant outages, are you in one currently?
1282369705924337665 2020-07-12 13:42:17 EDT <MSharifpourMD> Besides daily outages, sometimes in the middle of my @zoom_us meetings or in the middle of a movie?
1282368195022774274 2020-07-12 13:36:17 EDT <Xfinity> Let's help. Are you seeing any outage info in your My Account app?
1282347055210532864 2020-07-12 12:12:17 EDT <Hmurph99> Cox is terrible! Daily outages

1282268061865857025 2020-07-12 06:58:23 EDT <T_Tony_Tone> #Facts @Xfinity Had an outage on Friday (thanks, while I needed internet to work from home) and one this morning. I have not had a week without an outage since I started working from home in March.  https://twitter.com/cocoqt81/status/1282148757694537728¬†‚Ä¶
1282211019511590913 2020-07-12 03:11:44 EDT <BrassikArts> Thanks for the 4+ hour outage tonight,  @Xfinity @comcast !  Really made social distance fun when I couldn't share it with literally anyone.
1282198146638991360 2020-07-12 02:20:34 EDT <TheRealPartyM> I literally started service with @Xfinity last month, and have been through 3 or 4 outages in that time i thought y'all were the best
1282185989952344064 2020-07-12 01:32:16 EDT <wcaulkins> @Xfinity hardware trash. They just refurb the messed up gear and then send it back out. All week, internet goes out 5-6 times a day. No actual outages in the area. God forbid you‚Äôre in the middle of a gaming session. Or better working from home during COVID...
1282181975021883397 2020-07-12 01:16:19 EDT <HeelChad> Once again @Xfinity there is another outage after I been told by the previous agent that ‚ÄúI can assure you that this will not happen again‚Äù here we are again... I don‚Äôt want no $20 credit I want free services for all the bs #FedUpCustomer pic.twitter.com/VnwtkQSBXc
1282153151647215621 2020-07-11 23:21:47 EDT <THEKU420> @Xfinity you know it really sucks I just paid you guys a week early and then all the sudden right after I pay you there's an outage your garbage app takes up way too much space and your service can be absolutely horrendous don't take this the wrong way but you guys kind of suck
1282152221619228672 2020-07-11 23:18:05 EDT <CoryOlson89> @Xfinity So, is the regular, twice per day outages some new feature you're charging me for? Or is this some 12-month teaser set of outages?
1282150560284712961 2020-07-11 23:11:29 EDT <nikkinicole1908> I‚Äôve had more @Xfinity @comcast internet outages in the past 3 months than the past year. It might be time change my service. This is ridiculous. #xfinityoutage #xfinityinternet
1282148757694537728 2020-07-11 23:04:19 EDT <cocoqt81> Y'all need to start prorating some bills since y'all stay having service outages, @Xfinity
1282097425306595329 2020-07-11 19:40:21 EDT <JudgeBriian> Dawg Xfinity had a outage since 4:00pm in the afternoon what‚Äôs going on üòê
1282063962713071617 2020-07-11 17:27:22 EDT <unuthryear> You know @Xfinity and @comcast it has taken me an combined 90 minutes to fucking get my service working between a "fucking system update" and 30 second power outage. It shouldn't be this difficult
1282009458302828544 2020-07-11 13:50:48 EDT <georgee206> Me and my neighbor were just talkin bout how shitty comcast has been during covid yesterday and now theres an outage this morning. Fuck comcast/xfinity
1281986394404028417 2020-07-11 12:19:09 EDT <dom_foolery> @Xfinity how many power outages/ no WiFi are going to happen this week?  pic.twitter.com/ZEKwky4WTY
1281983737635450888 2020-07-11 12:08:35 EDT <liajanay> Xfinity and these outages are on my nerves ü§¨
1281771712124723200 2020-07-10 22:06:04 EDT <Joyful9294> What I‚Äôm trying to figure out is why @Xfinity has an outage at least 4 times each month. Y‚Äôall have no problem taking my payment every month though
1281763799347990530 2020-07-10 21:34:38 EDT <blutifuldevil> @Xfinity tonight makes the 3rd internet outage since Monday! Service was dropped on Mon/Thurs and now during an after-hours implementation I'm managing - UNACCEPTABLE! No CSR to speak with and est restoral is 4hrs!!!
1281759739521761280 2020-07-10 21:18:30 EDT <ShillerHiller> @Xfinity @comcast is the WORST cable/internet/phone service I have ever in my life experienced. Weekly issues-outages, cable freezing, phone service cutting out, internet sucking, etc etc etc LITERAL TRASH. #xfinity
1281755301419655170 2020-07-10 21:00:52 EDT <davecurran81> @Xfinity outage in Keystone Heights FL area 11 hours & counting. Do I get a refund/credit for the fact that I can‚Äôt do my job all day? How about a estimate for return to service?  SMH
1281752403616899075 2020-07-10 20:49:21 EDT <RhondaG79383532> @Xfinity we‚Äôve had an outage on and off for a week. We can‚Äôt even get a live person to talk to. What‚Äôs wrong with you guys?
1281749946434228225 2020-07-10 20:39:35 EDT <CBCAElite1> Here in CA it is on....must be Comcast/Xfinity outage there.  Check or report here too  https://outage.report/us/xfinity/detroit-wayne-county-michigan-united-states-4990729¬†‚Ä¶

1281739241878249474 2020-07-10 19:57:03 EDT <Believe_Psalm24> @Xfinity For the past three days my service has been "experiencing problems" this outage last 3 to 6 hours, what's going on with this disruption? How can your customers get credited for the hours that we are without service?
1281739140820697088 2020-07-10 19:56:39 EDT <sujamthe> Yes it‚Äôs up this morning. What caused the outage? Should we be concerned that this could happen again given our work from home plans?
1281732787398205445 2020-07-10 19:31:24 EDT <XmagikJ20> Bruh I'm in a power outage rn so i might miss the Xfinity race today.

1281696353115148288 2020-07-10 17:06:38 EDT <joannes_> Xfinity said the outages won‚Äôt be fixed till 9pm.  pic.twitter.com/PWTYyvkzEI

1281680009715789824 2020-07-10 16:01:41 EDT <hkstinnett> @Xfinity What‚Äôs up with the daily outages for multiple weeks?! I cannot work from home if the WiFi keeps going out. It‚Äôs not my equipment - these are area outages. Some last for hours. Whyyyy is this not better?
1281678268672819200 2020-07-10 15:54:46 EDT <LiefRunsFar> I'm done with trying to get @Xfinity to keep me from having service outages. But @ConnexionFC is also losing my confidence by dragging their feet in installing. Is there a third option in #fortcollins? Cc:@fortcollinsgov
1281673391448227842 2020-07-10 15:35:23 EDT <emiliainspace> @Xfinity @comcastcares outages all week and my internet is painfully slow today, what's going on?
1281673105161814016 2020-07-10 15:34:15 EDT <Gunplexion> Currently Xfinity had a massive fart outage in my area. Been trying to get internet for the last 7 hours. Will be streaming once it‚Äôs back up and will keep everyone updated. I pay Xfinity for the best internet and I have never seen connection so shittt in my life üí©
1281653095848644608 2020-07-10 14:14:44 EDT <Xfinity> Are you in an area outage?
1281648201725030400 2020-07-10 13:55:17 EDT <Xfinity> Have you been in an area outage this whole time?
1281643816601161728 2020-07-10 13:37:52 EDT <StephenRayGarza> Glad I wasn't super invested in watching streaming Ultraman day stuff as we have a full outage on our Xfinity at the moment. Website said most likely fixed by 5pm.
1281642369784389634 2020-07-10 13:32:07 EDT <rayyzedd> Xfinity hello . I would greatly appreciate it if I could speak to someone about the constant outages in my outages in my area that last for HOURS at a time.
1281641872696512517 2020-07-10 13:30:08 EDT <Xfinity> We apologize for the outages you've been experiencing, we understand how frustrating that is. Are you in an outage currently?
1281639602843865088 2020-07-10 13:21:07 EDT <bmenrigh> Day #2 of a partial Comcast xfinity outage. It has actually gotten worse. At 50% packet loss TCP doesn't work anymore.  pic.twitter.com/mDMrRmoINs
1281636092022714370 2020-07-10 13:07:10 EDT <ChantellArtis> @Xfinity people are working from home. To have an outage and it won‚Äôt be fix for hours you‚Äôre messing up with people finances
1281633071838748672 2020-07-10 12:55:10 EDT <Just_80> @comcast @Xfinity @comcastcares Can you tell your Boca Raton FL branch to get their shit together. These internet outages are causing me to lose money because I work remotely. And you can't even get ahold of a real person because of the pandemic. Wtf bro.
1281608341991624704 2020-07-10 11:16:54 EDT <HeelChad> I don‚Äôt care if y‚Äôall annoyed. But enough is enough @Xfinity wth man again with another outage smh ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1281601902514442240 2020-07-10 10:51:19 EDT <_Kint> Do you ask for a credit during these outages?
1281599135523770368 2020-07-10 10:40:19 EDT <xobethanid> so annoyed with @Xfinity and these outages.
1281587840787324933 2020-07-10 09:55:26 EDT <katlynadina> I have literally had more problems with my internet since we upgraded and now Xfinity is saying there‚Äôs an outage until 1:42??? How am I supposed to work üò≠
1281584142933790722 2020-07-10 09:40:45 EDT <RayKushington> @Xfinity I had a flash power outage last night and now my internet has been out since 12. I‚Äôve restarted the gateway multiple times but all I‚Äôm getting is a blinking green light.
1281580147481751559 2020-07-10 09:24:52 EDT <primalexp> Issue has not been resolved and there is no area outage
1281578823306313733 2020-07-10 09:19:36 EDT <Xfinity> Is there's any area outage, we can't send a technician out until the area issue is resolved. We apologize for this inconvenience. We're working to fix the issue ASAP.
1281578231561367553 2020-07-10 09:17:15 EDT <Daniellee_Reiss> Why is xfinity WiFi so fucking shitty... there‚Äôs literally an outage every week
1281577690538160129 2020-07-10 09:15:06 EDT <Xfinity> Hi John. We're sorry for the inconvenience the interruption caused. Be sure to check the My Account app for outage updates.
1281570387692867584 2020-07-10 08:46:05 EDT <austintgoodwin> Hey @Xfinity  3 outages in 6 weeks? All with ZERO warning.  The people who do have jobs have to work them from home.  Kind‚Äôve hard to do that with the most inconsistent internet service.  And I‚Äôve had Charter... so that says a lot. It might be time for AT&T  pic.twitter.com/cF7NqOWV5i
1281544496480768001 2020-07-10 07:03:12 EDT <koco83> Xfinity, the last thing my wife and I have time for while trying to work from home with a 7 month old is to chat with one of your reps to get a much deserved credit for 3+ days of no service. You should be able to automatically credit our account if your app can pinpoint outages.
1281478130184544258 2020-07-10 02:39:29 EDT <supperfoxTW> @comcastcares Any update on Xfinity outage in 95129 area? It‚Äôs been close to 9hrs
1281461356114452480 2020-07-10 01:32:50 EDT <Mitch1801> @Xfinity @comcast @comcastcares how about informing customers of a ‚Äúscheduled‚Äù outage before the scheduled outage. People that pay for your service work 24/7. If you are going to be out for 5 hours we need to know.
1281443782169374721 2020-07-10 00:23:00 EDT <sdcruz1991> @comcastcares @comcast @Xfinity I‚Äôve been in an outage all day and every time I check the status it pushes out. Will this be resolved by tomorrow!? With so many people forced to work from home I was hoping it would be a priority to get us back up and running.  pic.twitter.com/tKHI44UI7h
1281434789707313153 2020-07-09 23:47:16 EDT <Cortland22> Xfinity killin me rn with this outage üòí

1281416821392969730 2020-07-09 22:35:52 EDT <SoujaSam> @Xfinity How on earth am I experiencing another outage in my area? Two in one week? TV and internet? Has the CEO  ever experienced two outages in a week? #Treatmebetter
1281414315564769281 2020-07-09 22:25:55 EDT <io_bora> Relax, it's you xfinity outage
1281414265304276992 2020-07-09 22:25:43 EDT <eperez_md> Hey, @comcastcares and @Xfinity your chat rep Micah did a good job today.  Micha deserves a thank you from management.   How about fixing the recurring service outages CR914535824?
1281413905726599168 2020-07-09 22:24:17 EDT <dirty_d0n> I‚Äôm having a great fucking week my WiFi won‚Äôt be back up for like 2 days Bc there‚Äôs a outage for xfinity or something
1281413378880221185 2020-07-09 22:22:11 EDT <Bashwr82> @Xfinity @comcast @comcastcares internet down in Belmont Michigan. App reports no outages. All neighbors without internet. Any insight?
1281403733583200261 2020-07-09 21:43:52 EDT <_mythopoeia> Yes and every time I do it says service unavailable. I‚Äôve rebooted my modem and router and still nothing. Outage map says my area is fine, but my equipment is not the issue
1281400366978994176 2020-07-09 21:30:29 EDT <RDunphy7> @Xfinity @comcastcares again with the outages. We serious?
1281388685011935234 2020-07-09 20:44:04 EDT <Doty152> 10+ internet disconnects, 2 neighborhood wide outages, 1 tech visit, and still having issues. @Xfinity, how hard is it to provide your customers the services that they pay for? I can‚Äôt work without internet. I don‚Äôt work, I don‚Äôt get paid. I don‚Äôt get paid, you don‚Äôt get paid.
1281385339668570115 2020-07-09 20:30:46 EDT <7DivineWill> @Xfinity  I HAVE BEEN HAVING OUTAGES ALL WEEK FAM WHATS GOOD
1281384228689719296 2020-07-09 20:26:21 EDT <Xfinity> Does your My Account app indicate that you're in an area outage?
1281381113118822406 2020-07-09 20:13:58 EDT <Xfinity> Hi! If you're in an area outage, keep an eye on your My Account app for updates.
1281375287687753729 2020-07-09 19:50:50 EDT <SimplyJu3> @Xfinity what‚Äôs up with the outages everyday this week üò§
1281375143047106560 2020-07-09 19:50:15 EDT <SJ_lovesyou> Why am I paying all this money for internet for y‚Äôall to always have an outage??? @Xfinity
1281373280159494145 2020-07-09 19:42:51 EDT <PandaBurrz> Have to end stream early! I'm so sorry! Xfinity having outages today. Streaming tomorrow though @4pm PST üíñ Cya! Thnx for the follows
1281371853710340096 2020-07-09 19:37:11 EDT <_SportsNerd> @Xfinity @comcastcares it would be really great if this wasn‚Äôt the third time in four days YOU had an outage.  pic.twitter.com/bxaPCvr6R2
1281369707870920707 2020-07-09 19:28:39 EDT <stspears8> Update- Xfinity WiFi has an outage in my area @  2:30 this afternoon right before a 1 on 1 meeting with a new co-worker. I scramble up Starbucks to work the rest of the day on the outside patio in 90 degree weather cuz you know Rona.. But how‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs week going?  https://twitter.com/stspears8/status/1280633457824149507¬†‚Ä¶
1281366105299329031 2020-07-09 19:14:20 EDT <Brodyhaugen2> But y‚Äôall have outages everydayüòÇ theres no reason we should be paying $300+ for a shitty company that cant have stable connections.
1281365910830362625 2020-07-09 19:13:34 EDT <arnielayne> I now understands what @Xfinity does to avoid talking to people. They claim there‚Äôs an outage in your area then say that an agent won‚Äôt be able to help until the outage clears. There‚Äôs no problem with my service, but that‚Äôs how they keep the calls down.
1281364662475460608 2020-07-09 19:08:36 EDT <InsertLoloHere> @Xfinity Will my bill get credited due to this 3hr outage today? #xfinity #XfinityOutage
1281361089528246272 2020-07-09 18:54:24 EDT <NO_PANTIES_ENT> The system say outage then it come on and goes out again
1281359672952459266 2020-07-09 18:48:47 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked your My Account app to see if there's an outage in your area?
1281354799829712901 2020-07-09 18:29:25 EDT <Shamso84> Yes there is a reported outage . Wish y‚Äôall would notify us
1281354564906684416 2020-07-09 18:28:29 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked your My Account app to see if you're in an outage?
1281353497284415489 2020-07-09 18:24:14 EDT <XclusiveStoriz> Yep it was outage everywhere for them hit them up on @Xfinity and they will credit your account
1281353361464397827 2020-07-09 18:23:42 EDT <serhodes002> @Xfinity Terrible customer service!!  Outages in neighborhood daily and no one will help. Just put us on a watch. How about fixing the problem???!
1281351921752662016 2020-07-09 18:17:59 EDT <TaylorSchaude> Government: Everyone must work from home.  @Xfinity: Hold my beer. *Internet Outage*  @Webpass: Yes, more @Xfinity customers. Thanks Comcast again.  pic.twitter.com/fA276Mnvif
1281335628467261440 2020-07-09 17:13:14 EDT <Xfinity> What's going on with your internet? Are you in an area outage?
1281334492054147072 2020-07-09 17:08:43 EDT <PapiRevolutionz> @xfinity bro wtf fix your shit. This is the 3rd outage TODAY. Been with y‚Äôall for 4 years but fuck this is bullshit
1281333740703289344 2020-07-09 17:05:44 EDT <Pooptroops> It says the outage has been fixed yet I still have no internet.
1281333010240098307 2020-07-09 17:02:50 EDT <Xfinity> The My Account app will tell you if you're affected by an outage in your area, and will also provide troubleshooting if there's an issue with your specific service.
1281327258947526659 2020-07-09 16:39:59 EDT <Xfinity> Hi. If you're in an area outage, keep an eye on your My Account app for updates. You can DM us here:  https://xfin.tv/support¬† for assistance with credits.

1281324613214052353 2020-07-09 16:29:28 EDT <Xfinity> Let's see what happened. Are you seeing an outage in your My Account app?
1281323321863348227 2020-07-09 16:24:20 EDT <AmethystAmber87> I have a deadline and word count to hit but Xfinity wants to have another outage.  pic.twitter.com/YVaf0GxIfA
1281323176241373184 2020-07-09 16:23:45 EDT <sperchikoff> It said there was an outage and that it would be up again at a certain time and it is back up right now, but how many outages can there be?
1281322137819717632 2020-07-09 16:19:38 EDT <BlackNTheCity> 10 hour service outage in one day @Xfinity @comcast @comcastcares and NO CREDIT.   This is customer ABUSE. you know we have limited options for internet, phone, and voice residentially.   You charge the same amount every month but I am unable to use my service consistently.
1281310868832206848 2020-07-09 15:34:51 EDT <Xfinity> Hey Russ. Are you checking through the Xfinity My Account app? If you are, the My Account app will provide updates and alerts about the outage in your area.
1281298232207949825 2020-07-09 14:44:38 EDT <SamEverett4> @Xfinity can you guys chill on the outages in the Lakeview area kind of have to work  - paying customer
1281297640966234113 2020-07-09 14:42:17 EDT <SocMedSean> Because nothing says @Xfinity like another area-wide outage. Once a week like clockwork...  @comcastcares
1281288017643278337 2020-07-09 14:04:03 EDT <BJayZay> Nothing better than working from home with @Xfinity WiFi that constantly has local outages. On the 5th one this week.
1281287832238272516 2020-07-09 14:03:19 EDT <Xfinity> We're sorry for the inconvenience the interruption has caused, and our techs are working to get everything restored asap. You can use the My Account app for outage alerts and updates. If you don't have the My Account app you can locate it here:  https://xfin.tv/2O6kh6C¬†.
1281279568217849859 2020-07-09 13:30:28 EDT <Xfinity> We want to help, are you seeing any area outage info in your My Account app?
1281277933257187328 2020-07-09 13:23:58 EDT <Cat_Z_23> @Xfinity internet outage for a second week in a row, when a lot of us are working from home - what‚Äôs going on??!
1281277425498894336 2020-07-09 13:21:57 EDT <PapiRevolutionz> @Xfinity there have been service outages for 4 days now. Y‚Äôall making it real hard to work from home. Fix your shit
1281276245330845697 2020-07-09 13:17:16 EDT <Xfinity> Sorry for the frustration. Are you seeing any area outage info in your My Account app?
1281258977481969665 2020-07-09 12:08:39 EDT <They_Hate_CHAY> Xfinity irritating with this dumb ass 2 hour outage! Bitch I got work to do üò§

1281238954247847937 2020-07-09 10:49:05 EDT <SayItAint__> Xfinity is on some bullshit. Its been an outage since last night üòí
1281220552271806471 2020-07-09 09:35:58 EDT <Talis55> @Xfinity how do I find out if there is an outage in my area ?
1281205019803627521 2020-07-09 08:34:15 EDT <Xfinity> Let's find out what's causing the interruption. Does the My Account app list a service outage?
1281203819527970816 2020-07-09 08:29:28 EDT <1MoneyMark1> According to my browser history, my most frequently visited website is @Xfinity Outage Map.
1281117561267109888 2020-07-09 02:46:43 EDT <LadyBobby4> I‚Äôve heard stories from friends that had it locally and they get a lot of outages and throttling. I‚Äôve not had many outright outages w @Xfinity but I definitely have not been happy with their rates and how I can‚Äôt get the speed I‚Äôm paying for :/
1281112012320358400 2020-07-09 02:24:40 EDT <Bean_Dip_31> @Xfinity I just want to let you know that you‚Äôre a terrible service provider. Unplanned outages and just piss for coverage.
1281109920700600327 2020-07-09 02:16:21 EDT <NiaaaaBiaaaa> I was in the middle of watching my tv show @Xfinity !! Fix this outage problem
1281105201689251840 2020-07-09 01:57:36 EDT <RicoPeezy> @Xfinity why is there ALWAYS an outage in Downtown Detroit üôÑüôÑ
1281096082789933056 2020-07-09 01:21:22 EDT <BlackNTheCity> Trying to get an agent on the phone with @Xfinity when experiencing a 6 hour service outage is like trying to find a piece of chocolate in the dark. They have the WORST customer service EVERRRRRRRRR
1281092678910959616 2020-07-09 01:07:50 EDT <_LETTmeB> Oh xfinity playing games. Y‚Äôall wanna have a damn outage?!!?!
1281085415387209730 2020-07-09 00:38:59 EDT <Thatsdee0> @Xfinity  damnnn we got a outage @Stahtistics_
1281055373487636480 2020-07-08 22:39:36 EDT <Aviaritrix> So uh I‚Äôm assuming since the outage map isn‚Äôt available, that the internet issues and tv issues we‚Äôre having is on you @Xfinity ? Love we can‚Äôt even check outages. üôÉ
1281043892461240325 2020-07-08 21:53:59 EDT <AmyandJoeValdez> @comcastcares services going out all the time is really getting annoying when monthly rates are so high #Comcast #xfinity #outage #annoyed #annoy #annoying #Fixit too expensive for so many outages
1281037588992790528 2020-07-08 21:28:56 EDT <homiezgaming> Internet outage right as I start streaming..... cool thanks Xfinity. üòëüòëüòë
1281034594037329920 2020-07-08 21:17:02 EDT <theJakeShaw> The app shows no outages reported
1281034460213866497 2020-07-08 21:16:30 EDT <RickyClaar1> What‚Äôs causing the outage?
1281031071497363456 2020-07-08 21:03:02 EDT <gdawg74> Another @xfinity outage.  If you're tempted to switch it @xfinity, don't.
1281024740442943489 2020-07-08 20:37:53 EDT <CourtOConnell> You know what‚Äôs fun? An @Xfinity outage lasting 2 days in our area and not being able to use our baby monitor. I‚Äôll be looking forward to the massive credits to our account for this inconvenience.  pic.twitter.com/GBVp7rNCcO
1281021516591837184 2020-07-08 20:25:04 EDT <Xfinity> You can pull up the Xfinity My Account app for information on the outage. It's a great tool to have!
1281020320447631365 2020-07-08 20:20:19 EDT <Xfinity> Is there a reported outage in the area?
1281019393707667456 2020-07-08 20:16:38 EDT <Zombywoof724> I use the app already. Customers need more notice on outages & 3 in less than an week is unacceptable
1281007497025896451 2020-07-08 19:29:21 EDT <cuagain2011> Hell hath no fury like a woman who is being cheated out of overtime pay bc @Xfinity has had 2 outages in one day!!
1281006054776733699 2020-07-08 19:23:38 EDT <cuagain2011> @xfinity 2 outages in one day... you deserve to meet Satan. Debating whether I should sue you for lost wages..
1281004764830916608 2020-07-08 19:18:30 EDT <judgekempjr> #Comcast #Xfinity - you need to get your shit together! Another outage? Some of us are trying to work here... from home. I was on a Zoom call and suddenly everything frozeü§¨. This is the third time this has happened in the past week. Now I can't even speak to a human! WTF - rant.
1281004662330552321 2020-07-08 19:18:06 EDT <CaptainJen25> 2. Xfinity outage. I used chat to get a credit for it. Rep then announced I could save $15 a month on internet. He creates the plan... not mentioning "free" streaming (free first month; $10/month afterwards; $110 early termination fee). @Xfinity @comcastcares #xfinity #fcc #scam
1280987394037157888 2020-07-08 18:09:28 EDT <Ms_Roberts_> I moved in April. New spot only had @ATT At first I was happy; it‚Äôs fiber and cheaper than @Xfinity but I have to say it absolutely sucks. Slow. Frequent outages. Poor connection.
1280983131445739529 2020-07-08 17:52:32 EDT <tuelzz> lol i come home to a @Xfinity outage in my area, ggwp.

1280964291634491392 2020-07-08 16:37:40 EDT <LiaBeeyah> Since covid Xfinity been having so many outages üòëüôÑ
1280960953518034944 2020-07-08 16:24:25 EDT <MichaelCMoor> Guys, sorry about all the tech issues today. Xfinity is showing outages in my area so our whole neighborhood has no internet.   I will be live again once my connection is restored! See you guys later ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
1280949947454480384 2020-07-08 15:40:41 EDT <ramanathraju> @comcastcares Xfinity is down for me and my neighbors in my area and your app says there is no outage. And keeps on asking me to check my cables. Why is it not showing as outage to you guys
1280941004313550855 2020-07-08 15:05:08 EDT <Ili_says> Not only is there a @Xfinity outage but my @TMobile service is shit right now. Love that for me. üò£
1280940471922065408 2020-07-08 15:03:01 EDT <voicesmatter20> @Xfinity I have been hours without service now due a service outage !! How much longer do I have to wait??! Are you going to give me credit in my bill? #restoremyservice now #petworth #dc
1280931305509629952 2020-07-08 14:26:36 EDT <Or_St14> I am unable to work from due to an internet outage. The original timeframe I received for resolution was 10:28 am. Now the projection for resolution is after 2:00 pm.
1280931094842359814 2020-07-08 14:25:46 EDT <bbbygail> @comcastcares @Xfinity PLEASE FIX MY WIFI OR GIVE ME A REFUND!!!! this is the 4th time this month i‚Äôve experienced a day-long outage with no heads up. how am i supposed to work from home with useless wifi
1280926231085621249 2020-07-08 14:06:26 EDT <Xulifyy1> Bro! Same you use xfinity? Because they are upgrading their internet so that‚Äôs why there is a lot of power outages
1280923039996227591 2020-07-08 13:53:45 EDT <DonDelillo69> If you asked @comcastcares or @Xfinity to fix your internet outage, they‚Äôll try to sell you cable television. These greedy fuckers only care about the bottom line. Thanks for the terrible internet.
1280922119195549701 2020-07-08 13:50:06 EDT <DonDelillo69> @Xfinity @comcastcares nationwide wifi/ internet outages. Why no explanation? Why not admit your incompetence has made you vulnerable to attacks by nefarious parties? Why not admit it? It‚Äôs easier than lying.
1280919502352535553 2020-07-08 13:39:42 EDT <DonDelillo69> Amazed at the disrespect displayed by @Xfinity @comcastcares  internet outages every single week for their paying customers. Terrible customer service in respond to the outages. No recourse, refunds, or anything.
1280918844333264897 2020-07-08 13:37:05 EDT <DonDelillo69> I have tens of thousands of $USD on the line today. @Xfinity @comcastcares doesn‚Äôt give a single shit about me. I‚Äôve never been more disappointed in a company in my life. Thanks xfinity for the internet outage in Memphis.
1280901761344167937 2020-07-08 12:29:12 EDT <DonDelillo69> @Xfinity @comcastcares #xfinityoutage why does my internet in downtown Memphis Tennessee shut off every week? Outage every week. No explanation why the internet is down every single week!
1280899184930013185 2020-07-08 12:18:58 EDT <DonDelillo69> @comcastcares @Xfinity Downtown Memphis internet outage. The nail is in the coffin. I don‚Äôt think I can continue to pay this horrid company any more money. This is every single week that I have an outage.
1280898091206524928 2020-07-08 12:14:37 EDT <DonDelillo69> Ignored. Stranded. Left for dead. Thanks @comcastcares and @Xfinity  nonexistent customer services. Terrible app. Service outage every week guaranteed! Memphis sure loves you.
1280896830423863296 2020-07-08 12:09:36 EDT <DonDelillo69> @Xfinity @comcastcares fix the outage in downtown Memphis. Turns out some people have shit to do.
1280895186625875970 2020-07-08 12:03:05 EDT <DonDelillo69> @comcastcares @Xfinity fix the internet outage in downtown Memphis Tennessee. I‚Äôm supposed to be taking an exam. I am suffering directly due to your company‚Äôs failure to provide a service I PAY for!!!!
1280890487763865602 2020-07-08 11:44:24 EDT <toddhutner> @Xfinity I have an outage in my area, but my modem/router lights are not turning on at all. I have tried unplugging the router and resetting it with the button on the back. Still no lights. Does this mean my modem is broken too?
1280888054375424001 2020-07-08 11:34:44 EDT <pocomelograno> I just LOVE being forced to stick with @Xfinity because truly the only thing they're consistent at? Service outages. Every. Single. Day. üôÑ
1280883284898197504 2020-07-08 11:15:47 EDT <Enchanting70> I see the outage map and yes it shows an outage
1280882971738865666 2020-07-08 11:14:32 EDT <barbdills> Everytime i check the app it says "there's an outage in your area". What I am asking is, WHY is my internet out everyday. Especially during work hours.  I have missed a staff work call 2 days in a row now. We've been in a pandemic since March. Fix it
1280878410210971653 2020-07-08 10:56:25 EDT <Xfinity> We're sorry for the inconvenience the service interruption has caused. Does the Xfinity My Account app still list an area outage?
1280866303885152256 2020-07-08 10:08:18 EDT <Xfinity> We don't want to lose you, are you in an area outage currently?
1280861318405382144 2020-07-08 09:48:30 EDT <miamimike_305> @Xfinity This has been the absolute worst service I‚Äôve experienced. I‚Äôve never had an internet provider with this many outages and that required a restart of the modem so many times. I‚Äôve contacted support enough over the past few months that I essentially work for @xfinity now
1280852059131195393 2020-07-08 09:11:42 EDT <PJMarshall92> @comcastcares no cable or internet in Malden, MA. Xfinity‚Äôs outage website is down. Any updates?
1280843461231550466 2020-07-08 08:37:32 EDT <Xfinity> Oh no! Hopefully Sebastian didn't break- in. Were you able to confirm the outage and check for status updates in the My Account app? You may also track your service throughout the day.
1280839571325046786 2020-07-08 08:22:05 EDT <gamb1tsgaming> Oh wonderful, internet outage that isn‚Äôt supposed to be back up until afternoon. This really makes working from home so much simpler üôÑüôÑüôÑ @Xfinity @comcast
1280747401154879488 2020-07-08 02:15:50 EDT <ErisWheels> If you REALLY have a scheduled outage/maintenance, what is stopping you from letting customers sign up to get notifications about it @Xfinity @comcastcares @comcast ? Why can you do one and not the other? https://twitter.com/ErisWheels/status/1280746119492968448¬†‚Ä¶
1280746673631899651 2020-07-08 02:12:56 EDT <_trips451> Ya same as me. I checked their outage was supposed to start an hr ago. Guess I'll just sleep. Thanks the confirmation
1280746545495900161 2020-07-08 02:12:26 EDT <lagooons> Xfinity our right now, says on the app there are no outages yet i go on twitter and its down for other people what a great ispüôÇ
1280740609519767552 2020-07-08 01:48:50 EDT <jackieOs> Is there an @Xfinity outage in Katy/Houston Texas ... because I was in the middle of a good show and this crap cut off #comeonman
1280728100553273344 2020-07-08 00:59:08 EDT <ISUFlyboys> I am starting to think that @Xfinity has the worst service out there. I pay way to much for the constant outages. And then it takes more than 24 hours for Customer Service to respond to a message. Whats the excuse this time @Xfinity ????
1280722990502723585 2020-07-08 00:38:50 EDT <lionheart4g> @Xfinity how do I sign up to find out about your "planned" outages? I'm kind of tired of being kicked offline because you guys decided you wanted to take things down for 9+ hours!
1280710612440559617 2020-07-07 23:49:39 EDT <Gatorwrangler75> Dear @Xfinity @comcast, why are there so many service outages?  Why is it that, when you did not fix the problem by the planned time, did you not send an update? Why do you never offer a credit when service is down?
1280697866273591297 2020-07-07 22:59:00 EDT <WinnersPurpose> @Xfinity @comcastcares I‚Äôve DM‚Äôd you spoke with various agents on my internet outages and I get no responses. Debating on switching ISP because my internet has been down for almost 24 hours with no acknowledgement or responses.
1280694516890996736 2020-07-07 22:45:41 EDT <tharealfil_23> @Xfinity so is my internet ever going to get fixed! Seems like there‚Äôs been in outage in my area for the past week and y‚Äôall just keep pushing it to the next day!
1280680649825935360 2020-07-07 21:50:35 EDT <andreaakristine> My neighborhood: we‚Äôre giving everyone free internet and cable with xfinity.   One week later: .... there has been an internet outage in the neighborhood   Yay. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1280677725771087872 2020-07-07 21:38:58 EDT <johep> @xfinity This is the second time during the quarantine that we‚Äôve had an outage of hours. No Internet or TV since early this afternoon in Weston, FL.
1280676812822102016 2020-07-07 21:35:20 EDT <fonchis> Any clue, @Xfinity @comcastcares , as to when the outage will be resolved in Western Broward county? This is the second one in as many months! #xfinityoutage
1280672286278893569 2020-07-07 21:17:21 EDT <Xfinity> Keep checking the Xfinity My Account app for information on the outage.
1280670935792726018 2020-07-07 21:11:59 EDT <bkropp8> Can‚Äôt get any additional information on the outage in my area. The fix time keeps getting pushed back. Need to know if I have to start looking for somewhere else to work from tomorrow
1280666051064344576 2020-07-07 20:52:34 EDT <HongyiFan1> This is my first month with xfinity and I am experiencing outages 3 days in a row now! It's getting ridiculous! Even though I received ur text telling me the service is up my internet is still extremely unstable. Very disappointed.
1280661047565828098 2020-07-07 20:32:41 EDT <Xfinity> Many issues can be resolved through self-service methods. Did you check your My Account app to see if there's an outage in your area?
1280660904271642624 2020-07-07 20:32:07 EDT <_shvnzz> @comcastcares @Xfinity @comcast Are there any outages? I have been experiencing issues since 6/28/20. unable to reach an agent over the phone.
1280660679482052608 2020-07-07 20:31:14 EDT <Xfinity> Hi there! We're happy to give you outage information and troubleshooting help. Download the Xfinity My Account app for that and more!
1280646297524019203 2020-07-07 19:34:05 EDT <anilFlorida> @Xfinity just rain caused internet outage in the area for since afternoon. Poor service and on top of it IVR says thanks for calling good bye inspite of asking for customer service
1280645595649249280 2020-07-07 19:31:17 EDT <anilFlorida> @Xfinity @comcast what a change poor customer service.. internet outage and on top of it no one answers at customer service I‚Äôve msg says they are still transitioning to work from home situation
1280639584095932416 2020-07-07 19:07:24 EDT <aegon_80> Another outage in my area huh @Xfinity @comcast .  Trash service!!
1280635787462103040 2020-07-07 18:52:19 EDT <MegWritesWords> @comcast @Xfinity  Loving these hours-long internet outages we've been having EVERY SINGLE DAY for the last 10 DAYS. It's not like we have to work from home or anything üôÉüôÉüôÉüôÉüôÉüôÉüôÉ
1280630133167194117 2020-07-07 18:29:51 EDT <daflow2020> Nobody can tell my why I have an outage, and the time keeps moving forward and forward. I‚Äôm frustrated. I work from home and now I‚Äôm losing out on hours. What‚Äôs the deal here
1280627754606768131 2020-07-07 18:20:24 EDT <lawyerinbeta> Nice 6-hour outage AGAIN, @xfinity. I'd love to watch the sleep course on headphones during the 45 min naps that my baby has been taking on top of me all day, but I have no home internet or strong enough mobile signal (not T-Mobile's fault, i live in the Everglades) for video.
1280624414883807233 2020-07-07 18:07:08 EDT <KellenBrooks> The internet service cuts in and out and we currently haven‚Äôt had signal for the last 3 days but when i check the app it says no outages. Canceling asap
1280621353796804608 2020-07-07 17:54:58 EDT <BradleyBaird> Lol there's an Xfinity outage and the outage map isn't working. There's an outage with the outage map.
1280620383566266369 2020-07-07 17:51:06 EDT <Xfinity> Does your My Account app indicate an outage in your area?
1280613342265122816 2020-07-07 17:23:08 EDT <scott_shifflett> @Xfinity really killing it with not one but two separate outages today. Not like I am trying to wfh.
1280612001627193344 2020-07-07 17:17:48 EDT <EverybodyKnwsDT> 3rd day in a row @Xfinity WiFi has had an outage around this time. I‚Äôm getting suspicious about this bs.
1280605887107870723 2020-07-07 16:53:30 EDT <gabemazzarella> no stream today due to @Xfinity @comcast 's dog shit service and constant internet outages. sorry to my 3 regular viewers :/
1280599472830119936 2020-07-07 16:28:01 EDT <Xfinity> Hey! Please check your My Account app for info and updates on outages in your area.
1280598109492559872 2020-07-07 16:22:36 EDT <xoRobss> Next time have an outage in the middle of the night instead of the middle of the work day üôÑ @Xfinity
1280589946030620684 2020-07-07 15:50:10 EDT <Heredia57Raul> @comcastcares WTF IS GOING ON WITH THE INTERNET! I have been calling and the robot ü§ñ keeps hanging up on me when will Comcast end the poor customer service I‚Äôm off line due to a outage SMH again I needed to be credited for been off line. Comcast or Xfinity clean up your act  pic.twitter.com/LrflbehtxG
1280586374261899267 2020-07-07 15:35:58 EDT <GodThatLimps> Xfinity is total garbage. Every time I have a power outage the internet goes down for hours on end, and over the phone they're just like "unplug and replug. If it doesn't work we'll have to schedule for a technician to fix it." Then they schedule an appointment for the text day
1280572616626053120 2020-07-07 14:41:18 EDT <ufcknthought> @Xfinity @comcastcares you guys are working my nerves on this beautiful Tuesday. How the hell do y‚Äôall have an all day outage knowing how many people are WFH now? plus i been waiting for an agent for 45 minutes.
1280571571611013121 2020-07-07 14:37:09 EDT <Xfinity> Hey. You can check your My Account app to see if there's an outage affected in your area. It will also provide updates for you.
1280568435278217217 2020-07-07 14:24:41 EDT <ramenssb> Yea sorry about that lmao. Xfinity said there was a service outage in our area last night, hence the bad lag
1280567954170679298 2020-07-07 14:22:46 EDT <nckmrtnz> When I go into the app, it tells me to check the service outages which then tells me they can‚Äôt be displayed but I can schedule a callback. When I do that, there‚Äôs problems with scheduling a callback.
1280563558997204992 2020-07-07 14:05:18 EDT <GetMoneyMook> Best part about this xfinity outage is I get to take a little nappy nap
1280556563997118464 2020-07-07 13:37:31 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked your My Account app to see if there's an outage reported in your area?
1280551628827955201 2020-07-07 13:17:54 EDT <justxfred> @Xfinity off and on. Off and on. Can y‚Äôall figure this out so I can get some work done! 2nd outage today.  https://twitter.com/justxfred/status/1280526550270607360¬†‚Ä¶
1280539479762243590 2020-07-07 12:29:37 EDT <Xfinity> We''re sorry for the issues you've been having, we understand staying connected is important. Let's see what's causing these constant outages. Send us a DM here:  https://xfin.tv/support¬† üëà
1280536113782947842 2020-07-07 12:16:15 EDT <Paintboxer> In 4 mos of isolation @xfinity internet has had 50+ outages. Meanwhile, the bill has gone up twice. So they're charging me more for shittier service? Great business model. @googlefiber PLEASE come to our neighborhood. I'll gladly pay more just to be rid of @Comcast.
1280531728201908224 2020-07-07 11:58:49 EDT <Xfinity> We're sorry for the inconvenience the downtime has caused. If the My Account app is still showing the outage, then our techs are aware and working to get everything restored asap. Be sure to monitor the app for any updates.
1280526550270607360 2020-07-07 11:38:15 EDT <justxfred> @Xfinity not even 24hrs later...another internet outage.  https://twitter.com/justxfred/status/1280175090718646272¬†‚Ä¶
1280525729030119424 2020-07-07 11:34:59 EDT <ItsMe_Neo> @Xfinity @comcastcares Comcast what is going on? There has been an outage everyday in my area since Friday. It‚Äôs really difficult for me to work from home with this constantly happening. #frustrated
1280502498550329345 2020-07-07 10:02:40 EDT <kpwags> Not that we‚Äôre aware of. App says no outages.
1280500141779279874 2020-07-07 09:53:18 EDT <iamkingjhay> The devices will remain connected to the WiFi but I will get ‚Äúno internet connection‚Äù error messages. Then I check the app and there are reported outages. This happens everyday and the outages can last between 10mins or 4hrs. Last night it was out for ‚Äúmaintenance‚Äù.
1280498903910154240 2020-07-07 09:48:23 EDT <FP723> @Xfinity service really sucks. Outages again.
1280490281876500484 2020-07-07 09:14:08 EDT <Xfinity> Have you been seeing any area outage issues showing in your My Account app during this timeframe?
1280477627162267648 2020-07-07 08:23:51 EDT <Xfinity> Let's get you back up, are you seeing any outage info showing in your My Account app?
1280469754503979008 2020-07-07 07:52:34 EDT <romaine_goddess> @Xfinity ugh an outage in my area from the stormüôÑ
1280426447904145408 2020-07-07 05:00:29 EDT <patrickimages> .@Xfinity internet is down. Your service outage maps say no outage in area. Account tools say problem detected with modem. Reset feature gave a 500 error. And can‚Äôt get anyone on the phone.
1280397730880380930 2020-07-07 03:06:22 EDT <2x4Plank> If a one day outage is killing you, I would not recommend Xfinity because my internet goes out everyday like clockwork.
1280388331080167425 2020-07-07 02:29:01 EDT <Dirrtbagg> I guess that air quality warning is no joke. Felt hard to breathe even riding at 1 AM.  Home just in time for the nightly @Xfinity outage. üòé
1280387333888643073 2020-07-07 02:25:03 EDT <AlexTheeGamer> Looks like we are done for the night sadly everyone...there‚Äôs an outage with xfinity in my area right now and that‚Äôs what caused the whole stream to crash...sorry to let you all down! @rtsmallstreams @small_streamers @TwitchHost @SmallStreamersC pic.twitter.com/KNsElwMPj1
1280382075045064704 2020-07-07 02:04:09 EDT <CodlyB> Xfinity is so dogshit with these random outages jfc
1280365115834093568 2020-07-07 00:56:46 EDT <iamkingjhay> Xfinity and Sprint gotta be the WORST carriers for internet. Xfinity has outages every 2hrs and Sprint dead ass just never has signal and won‚Äôt connect to the internet even when yo phone shows full LTE bars @sprintcare @Xfinity  y‚Äôall awful quiet
1280362072543571969 2020-07-07 00:44:40 EDT <Deejay_ashy> Xfinity back at it again with the outages ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
1280318339794055168 2020-07-06 21:50:54 EDT <Xfinity> Hey. Check your My Account app -- it will be updated with the latest info on any outages.
1280315716319633408 2020-07-06 21:40:28 EDT <alex_bransky> Outages. Like I said, I'm hard wired to the modem so it's not a WiFi issue. Power cycling the modem fixes it but that takes 7-8 minutes.
1280315415676153857 2020-07-06 21:39:16 EDT <SatisfiedCurve> Um I mean you could have someone give me credit for all the outages, throttling and restarts. Also for over charging me and also fix my area that I have worked on TRYING to get fixed for 2 years now? CAN you do this?? üòÜ
1280314678267150336 2020-07-06 21:36:21 EDT <Michell28006833> I called and automated message says its an outage but i want someone to confirm to make sure. I dont trust these automated recordings
1280314205984432128 2020-07-06 21:34:28 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked your My Account app to see if there's an outage in your area?
1280313007646662656 2020-07-06 21:29:42 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked your My Account app to see if there's an outage reported in your area?
1280310489269108737 2020-07-06 21:19:42 EDT <lladyllawyer> Storms came thru this afternoon. No cable or internet since 2:30. Comcast says we are only customer with interruption- no outage in area. How??#comcastoutage. @Xfinity
1280305666670854145 2020-07-06 21:00:32 EDT <BirchCollective> We‚Äôve lived in Alexandria for almost two years now and this is our first @Xfinity internet outage and idk what to do with myself.
1280298373866819585 2020-07-06 20:31:33 EDT <darrenpena8> @Xfinity and @comcastcares I have been on hold for 2 hours trying to get an outage answer. This is rediculous!! You have no problem sending emails on other things but not outages. When will this be fixed!
1280295818306650112 2020-07-06 20:21:24 EDT <Xfinity> Did you check the Xfinity My Account app? There could be an outage in the area. If there isn't, use the app to give your modem a reboot.
1280286656076054529 2020-07-06 19:45:00 EDT <Xfinity> Is there an outage reported through the Xfinity My Account app?
1280285224597938178 2020-07-06 19:39:18 EDT <Xfinity> Check the Xfinity My Account app for updates on any outages.
1280284866815328257 2020-07-06 19:37:53 EDT <Xfinity> Have you been experiencing outages or are you having connectivity issues with your WiFi?
1280280811871195138 2020-07-06 19:21:46 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Lou. We understand how frustrating it is to be without services. You can keep track of the outage through the Xfintiy My Account app.
1280262958690549762 2020-07-06 18:10:50 EDT <mariaflowerbomb> @Xfinity my internet is down, can someone tell me if there is an outage in my area?  Thank you.
1280259090174836737 2020-07-06 17:55:27 EDT <Mermaid_MariLex> We did. It shows an outage for 7/9/2020 which isn‚Äôt today.
1280250497413328896 2020-07-06 17:21:19 EDT <veronicasueb> love when we have back to back days of internet outages. @Xfinity üëåyes our account says there are issues. no this shouldn‚Äôt happen as often as it has.
1280247596972412929 2020-07-06 17:09:47 EDT <Xfinity> If the app indicates that there's an outage affecting your area, keep an eye there as it will provide the latest updates.
1280245026140893184 2020-07-06 16:59:34 EDT <_yasdnil> No outages. It‚Äôs gone out FOUR TIMES just today
1280241830957912067 2020-07-06 16:46:52 EDT <hyJOEgenBomb> Ironic tweet when my @comcast in Arlington has been experiencing an all day outage üò° second time in two months, seriously wth @Xfinity  https://twitter.com/ArlingtonVA/status/1280234901099462665¬†‚Ä¶
1280238292039073801 2020-07-06 16:32:49 EDT <StefaniannaAnna> It doesn‚Äôt show an outage. It happens constantly. I‚Äôm on the phone with a representative now. I‚Äôm so sick of the crap with this company. If the tv works the internet goes out, if it‚Äôs not the tv then it‚Äôs the remote, if its not the remote then it‚Äôs the WiFi.
1280229219067465729 2020-07-06 15:56:45 EDT <Xfinity> Hi there. In order to decrease your wait-time, you can check the Xfinity My Account app for outage info in your area. We'd be happy to look into crediting the acct. Just DM our support team your acct info:  http://xfin.tv/support¬† and they can assist from there.
1280228659471794179 2020-07-06 15:54:32 EDT <comcast> Hi Eric. Have you checked the Xfinity My Account app? There may be an outage in the area or planned maintenance going on. Give it a look and let me know if we can help out. -Gabbie
1280223466189455361 2020-07-06 15:33:54 EDT <Penguinlove0620> @Xfinity 3 days in a row of outage in my area!!! Multiple hours down...can‚Äôt work like this
1280209646662365184 2020-07-06 14:38:59 EDT <arindrajitag> Your refund is based on no.of hours and is not retroactive. You gotta understand 4 hours outage on Saturday night is not same as Monday morning. I missed two client meetings today. This is happening since March. Due to Covid, I was putting off installing Fios but not anymore.
1280208021403176962 2020-07-06 14:32:32 EDT <mcmileable> lol there's an Xfinity outage in College Park MD, home of the Xfinity Center
1280207953115701248 2020-07-06 14:32:15 EDT <Xfinity> Hey. Is there an outage reported in your My Account app?
1280204320621891584 2020-07-06 14:17:49 EDT <RockyMolina> Yes. But why are we having an outage every single day multiple times a day? This is unacceptable. I need someone to reach out to me.
1280202537312845824 2020-07-06 14:10:44 EDT <mudgilwithu> @Xfinity @comcastcares xfinity has heen a terrible service provider since beginning but over last few months it has broken its own record of how much more terrible you guys can be. Service outages almost numerous times a day when good consistent internet is such a critical need
1280199341228077056 2020-07-06 13:58:02 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Saeema. Sorry we missed this message - you can check for outages anytime through the Xfinity My Account app.
1280197437064437764 2020-07-06 13:50:28 EDT <Xfinity> Is there an outage reported on your My Account app during these times?
1280196895420436482 2020-07-06 13:48:19 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked the Xfinity My Account app to see if there were outages or if it was a connection issue that we could troubleshoot?
1280196377969143811 2020-07-06 13:46:16 EDT <RockyMolina> Why are we loosing service EVERY-SINGLE DAY? It is interrupting important zoom work meetings. & working from home in general is a nightmare with this many outages! I also can‚Äôt get ANYONE ON THE PHONE!
1280195023909388290 2020-07-06 13:40:53 EDT <bmrdz1> Area outages have been regularly occurring in my area (Chicago) for the last 24 hrs. Literally at least six so far.
1280194488342896641 2020-07-06 13:38:45 EDT <HeatherLesz> I can see that there is an outage in my area. But this is the fourth time it‚Äôs gone down since Thursday. Twice today.
1280192066069450752 2020-07-06 13:29:08 EDT <MarquisGardenM> @Xfinity man you guys have the worst internet Some days it‚Äôs good some days it‚Äôs bad and some days it just don‚Äôt work and it‚Äôs always a outage and anytime it rains the signal is weak FIX IT ASAP I shouldn‚Äôt be paying monthly for bull shit!

1280090136001249281 2020-07-06 06:44:06 EDT <BigLebowski> Hey @comcastcares, who's the regional exec in charge of @Xfinity Internet? We're going into week 4 of near-daily outages.
1280060407965761541 2020-07-06 04:45:58 EDT <Wydidya> @Xfinity is there currently an outage?
1280018366137200640 2020-07-06 01:58:54 EDT <EngageFTW> Its a network /node issue hiki shits happening to a majority of comcast customers. 58% packet loss several periods throughout the day like you‚Äôre getting dos‚Äôed . Make sure you are checking xfinity outage status on your account page as they pop up n go away quickly.
1279982266765250560 2020-07-05 23:35:27 EDT <smedranojr> @comcast @comcastcares @Xfinity internet has been down for over a day and we are paying for nothing.  Latest update another half day or more of outage.  Chatted with xfinity assistant and of course a bot.  We work from home xfinity due to COVID.  We need a service we pay for.....

1279938968750940161 2020-07-05 20:43:24 EDT <MrMissionaryOfc> Y'all need to hire some more my internet has been on and off for 3 days because of "outages". I'm trying to do my final projects but I guess it's not happening on Xfinity wifi.
1279935563064279040 2020-07-05 20:29:52 EDT <bashfulbunnie> @Xfinity üëã is there going to be an accurate estimate for when the outage  in chicago will be fixed by, or are you just going to keep pushing the estimate back  3 hours when you inevitably miss it again?
1279925390996275201 2020-07-05 19:49:27 EDT <JFernan13056126> @Xfinity your internet service is nothing but overpriced and terrible, weekly outages and support team that only knows how to restart modems.
1279921842111864832 2020-07-05 19:35:21 EDT <siouxkrause> Our @Xfinity @comcast has been on and off last night and all day today and now totally out but they tell us there is no outage but there's thousands of outages all around us. We pay for this??
1279919442500235264 2020-07-05 19:25:49 EDT <fcbruns> @comcastcares #outage again in zip code 60425. Please look into right away. Xfinity app again shows 'everything is good' .
1279903057409716224 2020-07-05 18:20:42 EDT <samming_tatum> @Xfinity this is asinine. Outages in my area ?? On a Sunday ? Can hardly use WiFi and can‚Äôt change the channel, you guys are ruining my life

1279885668601257986 2020-07-05 17:11:37 EDT <Jason_E_Bass> @comcast / @Xfinity.....seriously considering canceling our #internet service and returning to @ATT if you can't eliminate the outages that are occurring every other day!  Between that and the constant rebooting of my modem, I'm without internet, more than I'm with internet!
1279871527173992449 2020-07-05 16:15:25 EDT <ColG1977> Work was done in our house Thursday and throughout our entire alley on Friday. That was supposed to fix it. We are currently having our 2nd outage today. No internet, tv, home phone. We‚Äôre back to work tomorrow. What do we do?
1279853499719745539 2020-07-05 15:03:47 EDT <megamanZ95> Comcast: it must be a thing on your end Me: gets text saying comcast outage in my area.  This is ridiculous

1279792112045887488 2020-07-05 10:59:51 EDT <DanielHatcher23> Did you come to a resolution? Or did you get the same ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see any outages in your area‚Äù response? We‚Äôve been having issues for over two weeks now. It‚Äôs not a full-on outage. It‚Äôs sporadic and intermittent service disruptions.

1279134278727503873 2020-07-03 15:25:51 EDT <MightChase> If even half the things you stated in the video were true, then there wouldn‚Äôt be an outage for half of the entire country. Stop spreading lies, and actually give your customers the service they payed for.
1279133920840343554 2020-07-03 15:24:26 EDT <Swelkiss> Man @Xfinity ,  this internet outage thats been occurring quite often this year is getting quite annoying.  I pay too darn much just for internet üòí to have such problems.
1279072628687372288 2020-07-03 11:20:53 EDT <miamiabel> lol @Xfinity's shitty customer service has degraded to the point where their phone system is like "we can see there's an outage at your house, we can't really help you with anything until it's fixed, goodbye!"  BUT WHY IS IT DOWN FOR TWO DAYS THO
1279066305455443968 2020-07-03 10:55:45 EDT <jbsutta> How is it @Xfinity can have a outage for over 24hrs effecting 2500+ customers and not be able to provide an ETA for correction?!?!
1278986270690037765 2020-07-03 05:37:44 EDT <michel3131> Watching @HamiltonMusical and...  Xfinity outage right in the middle of The World Was Wide Enough.  What a kick in the pants.
1278985187238559751 2020-07-03 05:33:25 EDT <KatarzynaMuller> @comcastcares Do you? Do you really? Area outage going on 2 weeks, and your automated system won‚Äôt let me speak to an agent. How the HECK am I supposed to know when or apparently IF we‚Äôll get internet back up here. TRYING TO WORK FROM HOME. HELP!! @Xfinity @comcast https://twitter.com/KatarzynaMuller/status/1278983775460999170¬†‚Ä¶
1278983775460999170 2020-07-03 05:27:49 EDT <KatarzynaMuller> @Xfinity Hey @comcast, we have an ‚Äúarea outage‚Äù for close to 2 WEEKS now!!! - Every time I call, the automated system says I‚Äôm not ALLOWED to speak to agent because there‚Äôs an outage. But outage almost 2 WEEKS, so I still can‚Äôt speak to an agent. NEED INTERNET! + AN ANSWER!!!

1278934313019428864 2020-07-03 02:11:16 EDT <DRob34152042> Your outage over white cops killing blacks is fake news. Your hate is real.  pic.twitter.com/TdmeHHlgfF
1278926306613383179 2020-07-03 01:39:27 EDT <oflo13> @Xfinity please explain.. no outages my equipment is good but I keep getting tv errors and internet errors..
1278919083640029184 2020-07-03 01:10:45 EDT <divvd> A little. Call them if you pay full price and remember they said the outage began at 420pm 07/02/20 and you want adequate compensation.
1278916104048398337 2020-07-03 00:58:54 EDT <lesliemeans> Good luck! We tried to chat text with them & were told there was no outage in our area. üôÑ A few minutes later they said there was.
1278915243788263426 2020-07-03 00:55:29 EDT <divvd> I'm reaching out to customer service via chat text because the line drops when I call in.  This is the third major outage in the three months since I came back to @comcast had them 4 a decade b4 @ three houses with one minor outage. I need this to work from home soon.
1278910509811740672 2020-07-03 00:36:41 EDT <taco_jerry> I'm convinced that Xfinity and MaxxSouth are the same company. I have a friend that works for MaxxSouth, and every time he shares a memo on Facebook from the company about outages, we mysteriously have problems with Xfinity at the exact same time.
1278894565747879936 2020-07-02 23:33:19 EDT <divvd> .@comcast @Xfinity has been down in my neighborhood in Rose Park,  Salt Lake City for 5 hours now. They said it would be resolved by 8. Now they're just saying ASAP, no time specified and told ME to call THEM when the outage ended. Wut. 3rd long outage in 3 months.@comcastcares
1278890107165118464 2020-07-02 23:15:36 EDT <PacoAurelio> The outage of @Xfinity in Houston today is crazy! @comcastcares @comcast any chance of getting this solved today? Or this is just a social experiment about how crazy people get nowadays without internet/phone/TV???
1278880245051949056 2020-07-02 22:36:25 EDT <Pagan_rave1989> Whole time I thought it was my internet connection. My internet has had service outages problems all freaking day long with Xfinity constantly working on it
1278872864163336197 2020-07-02 22:07:05 EDT <LeonatoLynx> It is just on my home ISP connection (Xfinity), and as such is susceptible to outages on their part. I do apologise, it's just my hobby server at home, I wish I could get more uptime out of it than I do. Every time my ISP or power company let's me down, it hurts the bots. =^.^=
1278869590659997698 2020-07-02 21:54:05 EDT <JuniorGuwopp> Xfinity finally fixed the outage wit the WiFi, thought our shit was offüò≠
1278868629711446016 2020-07-02 21:50:16 EDT <grant_consultin> That would mean they have to proactively monitor their network and acknowledge the outages in their system that happe. Everyday and refund money to customers for not delivering services as promised #comcast
1278867658180628482 2020-07-02 21:46:24 EDT <HeelChad> MVP goes to @Xfinity for the most outages in history!!! Twice in one day Again #WhenWillThisEnd üò≠ ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è pic.twitter.com/QIzRPwVuf1
1278866022091587585 2020-07-02 21:39:54 EDT <ernes_totes> I haven‚Äôt had WiFi all day and @Xfinity keeps on pushing back the fix times. It started off at 10 am, 12:30 pm, 2 pm, and now it‚Äôs at 1:30 am. Any update on this Houston outage or discount we‚Äôre getting?
1278864637807734785 2020-07-02 21:34:24 EDT <Lesona_> .@comcast @comcastcares @Xfinity do we have any updates on the outage in Houston?
1278856891980972038 2020-07-02 21:03:37 EDT <Dome651> @Xfinity This outage at my house in Houston is unacceptable. Going on 11 hours. No TV, no internet. WTF??
1278851345823522816 2020-07-02 20:41:35 EDT <Robin_on_here> So sick of the daily outages. Working from home is getting to be impossible thanks for @Xfinity
1278846641680928770 2020-07-02 20:22:53 EDT <lilliesanne> @Xfinity this houston outage has been going on since 8am!! What‚Äôs the deal?!
1278839514321092616 2020-07-02 19:54:34 EDT <Susan82180705> Awful experience with @comcast @Xfinity this week! Cannot get a human on the phone to help with internet outage issues despite multiple calls, on-hold for hours, and disconnected calls.
1278836759250567169 2020-07-02 19:43:37 EDT <AneeneeC> @Xfinity do you normally leave long time customers on hold for an hour and 25 minutes when they've told you there's live wires causing an outage after a branch fell AND IT'S DANGEROUS
1278792869793292289 2020-07-02 16:49:13 EDT <markrichard> These @Xfinity outages are ridiculous. Second one today.
1278791691160477717 2020-07-02 16:44:32 EDT <yorugua1991> @Xfinity wtf is going on??? Outages everyday????? And i cant even get through to a representative #cancelxfinity
1278789688938033153 2020-07-02 16:36:35 EDT <312DARIUS__> Damn XFinity like top tier around here imo other than the outages
1278779858458476544 2020-07-02 15:57:31 EDT <Tony_Mogul> Mannn @Xfinity is playing with me. Can watch TV or get on the internet. This outage was supposed to be resolved hours ago!
1278775907382112270 2020-07-02 15:41:49 EDT <poplocknbl0ckit> @Xfinity are y‚Äôall planning to issue a credit to my account for the outage today? Shit‚Äôs been off since 8a this morning and was slated to be fixed by noon. Here we are.. 4 hours later ‚Äî and your call center reps keep getting ‚Äúdisconnected‚Äù. I‚Äôm ready to fight.
1278775283492012033 2020-07-02 15:39:20 EDT <Chill_LorBill> Xfinity got ah outage üòí
1278763509694767108 2020-07-02 14:52:33 EDT <Lashaeeee____> xFinity better get it together with this wifi outage
1278755571576049665 2020-07-02 14:21:01 EDT <DouglasGEck> I'd like to shout-out @Xfinity for basically cancelling work today. All-day WiFi outage on what should have been a productive day.  You literally have one job. ONE.
1278751380325490688 2020-07-02 14:04:21 EDT <loveeelenaxo> WTF @Xfinity y‚Äôall can‚Äôt be having outages with people working from home
1278731805609295872 2020-07-02 12:46:34 EDT <amandabise> @Xfinity @comcast @comcastcares Internet outage for the second day in a row - east central Indiana - going around b for about 20 minutes now
1278729624860725248 2020-07-02 12:37:54 EDT <Im_A_City_Boy> Oh great another internet outage this week courtesy of @Xfinity smh
1278725967029116928 2020-07-02 12:23:22 EDT <shawnbass> Yeah that exact thing just happened.   The reason for wanting to know if it‚Äôs their outage is it saves me a ton of time troubleshooting my network hardware only to find out it‚Äôs their outage.
1278723079427035137 2020-07-02 12:11:54 EDT <ModernSlaying> I'm down as well. Outage has been going on for 3 hours now. ETA for fix is past and no new updates. What's up @Xfinity? Some of us have to work, and some of us it's our day off
1278719900656304135 2020-07-02 11:59:16 EDT <martyLAHVelle> No company loves random middle of the workday outages like my people over at Xfinity
1278716330196205568 2020-07-02 11:45:05 EDT <covergirl53> Of course the last day I have Xfinity there‚Äôs a power outage üòê
1278715582947491849 2020-07-02 11:42:07 EDT <Xfinity> Hi. Have you checked your My Account app for info on any outages in your area?
1278714476620140544 2020-07-02 11:37:43 EDT <TheRealDJYoung> @Xfinity why is my service out again in Baltimore and when i call i can't get anyone on the phone i pay to much money for this type of customer service And outages this needs to be resolved now
1278712555054288896 2020-07-02 11:30:05 EDT <shawnbass> Hey @Xfinity why do I always have to use your app to learn about an outage in my area?   I‚Äôve enrolled in text notifications but it seems like you only text me after I enroll each outage.  How about texting me about the outage rather than the recovery?
1278708975815602176 2020-07-02 11:15:51 EDT <McGuireGMM> I went there saw that maintenance caused the outage. Planned maintenance on a Thursday at 930 AM. Why?
1278699081091743745 2020-07-02 10:36:32 EDT <ALL_ABOUT_TRESE> Looked on the app and it says there is an outage until 2:20. Wtf @xfinity ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨
1278694894358405123 2020-07-02 10:19:54 EDT <sohammaniar> @Xfinity outage in 77098 planning to be fixed in 4 HOURS!?!?
1278692883349078016 2020-07-02 10:11:55 EDT <McGuireGMM> @Xfinity any word on this internet outage in Wheaton, IL?
1278683752827322369 2020-07-02 09:35:38 EDT <Xfinity> We can look into what's going on. Are you seeing an area outage showing in your My Account app?
1278676469326254081 2020-07-02 09:06:41 EDT <HeelChad> Day 6: @Xfinity  another outage just wanted to do some graphic design work can‚Äôt even do that smh you guys are the WORST üò≠. #StopThePain #Overrated fix your service
1278674683693461508 2020-07-02 08:59:35 EDT <NMblondewino> The internets sure are slow here in NM since yesterday. Outages reported on the west cost for specter and xfinity/ comast yesterday, too.  We are probably being hacked.  Happened in 2016 about three weeks before the election.
1278667416931905536 2020-07-02 08:30:43 EDT <Xfinity> Hello. We're here to help. When your internet goes out do you check the My Account app for outages in your area?
1278665091269963777 2020-07-02 08:21:28 EDT <wkrtsinwndrlust> Honestly @Xfinity, this is our 5th outage in 1 week. Please get your shit together. @verizonfios is coming. And of course, no outages reported on your app. Cool.
1278663897411657728 2020-07-02 08:16:44 EDT <Maura_Renee> @Xfinity I have literally had internet outage every day this week! It‚Äôs getting pretty annoying since I work at home now. It would be great if this would get fixed and not happen every day #thankyou
1278539943489556480 2020-07-02 00:04:11 EDT <K_Rauscher> @Xfinity ANOTHER OUTAGE TODAY !!! Get it together #anotherdayanotheroutage #whatdoipayfor pic.twitter.com/rYhv0w2bac
1278533517077594112 2020-07-01 23:38:39 EDT <fuzzyEuclid> #comcast #xfinity just interesting when my internet is out and yet comcast(xfinity) says there's no problem. Yea, there is. You just don't want to publish it. IT guy here - I've done the usual troubleshooting.  So yes, there is an outage. Thanks to my cell phone, I can verify it.
1278517875834335233 2020-07-01 22:36:29 EDT <mjwalsh32> Very strange timing that the day after I cut everything from @Xfinity except WiFi that there‚Äôs an outage in my area.
1278511161625980930 2020-07-01 22:09:49 EDT <qwerty_101_> lol, Xfinity gives me 100 down and 15 up on a good day. And they have outages every few weeks. And garbage tech support. But yeah, same situation here, can't find a replacement.
1278504412709871617 2020-07-01 21:43:00 EDT <JBBauer612> @Xfinity I can‚Äôt take it anymore. 3 hours with text then voice people and still no resolution. My building had an outage today. You said service was restored 7 hours ago. My devices connect to gateway; gateway does NOT to internet. Send someone here ASAP.
1278499636198567936 2020-07-01 21:24:01 EDT <SassySweetCO> Thank you @Xfinity for the $5.11 credit you so graciously gave my account to make up for the many outages I continuously experience. You've made working from home a really great situation üôÑ
1278499249626525696 2020-07-01 21:22:29 EDT <Kevin_Belm_> @ATTHelp The second time our internet goes out this week since 5pm we haven‚Äôt had WiFi and no help or updates for any possible outages. Xfinity is looking pretty good right now.  pic.twitter.com/AT7JOmFYTV
1278488104131874816 2020-07-01 20:38:11 EDT <HeelChad> Day 5: @Xfinity  does it again with the random outage still no reply from there whatsoever they don‚Äôt care about their customers I see  pic.twitter.com/tX05URSmgn
1278485761927655424 2020-07-01 20:28:53 EDT <Lisabwhite67> @Xfinity I have been texting with 3 agents for 4 hours about a phone outage caused by the first agent, and now 2-8 hour wait by phone or call on Friday to speak with someone???Unacceptable!
1278483116596879361 2020-07-01 20:18:22 EDT <BigNastyValdez> Why the fuck is there an outage in my area xfinity mfs just wanna relax after work
1278481602859929600 2020-07-01 20:12:21 EDT <terry_berry_> @comcastcares @Xfinity My family in #littlerock Ar has been without service since Monday and has received UNACCEPTABLE customer service regarding their outage and you are jeopardizing their safety amidst a global pandemic. I‚Äôll be tweeting about this daily with momentum #xfinity
1278478211161219072 2020-07-01 19:58:53 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Megan. Does your My Account app indicate that you're in an area outage?
1278475767706292224 2020-07-01 19:49:10 EDT <TRiPz_HS> Got to love @Xfinity since last Thursday I‚Äôve had 4 outages in 6 days. Just waiting for tomorrow to see if they can make it 5/7 days of outages
1278470646389932032 2020-07-01 19:28:49 EDT <marcosxhall> @Xfinity Having an internet outage in zipcode 60622. Tried calling (3 hour wait), tried to report online, but there isn‚Äôt a way to. Why is it so difficult to report an outage?
1278469041577852928 2020-07-01 19:22:26 EDT <czechwestsea71> @Xfinity Is there an outage in West Seattle today?
1278457759676194816 2020-07-01 18:37:37 EDT <iReinaValentine> Yes, it‚Äôs an area outage; third one today and sixth in two days. I don‚Äôt understand.
1278457422005383168 2020-07-01 18:36:16 EDT <Xfinity> Does your My Account app indicate that you're in an area outage?
1278456396946735104 2020-07-01 18:32:12 EDT <MichaelJAltman> Really pissed at @Xfinity for an outage almost all day today. It‚Äôs not even storming or anything. Just no internet since lunch time and now they are saying it‚Äôll be our until 9:30!!
1278453845601984512 2020-07-01 18:22:03 EDT <iReinaValentine> Thanks to @Xfinity being the absolute garbage service that it just loves to be, my TV is frozen on this. Guess that‚Äôs my fault for watching Family Guy, at all, knowing another senseless outage is always one breath away at Xfinity.  pic.twitter.com/KjpdK6rzXZ
1278450992309243904 2020-07-01 18:10:43 EDT <Xfinity> You can check your My Account app for any outages in your area.
1278450580864864261 2020-07-01 18:09:05 EDT <BrentRivers14> @Xfinity yo @Xfinity is there an outage or something ? my wifi isnt working right
1278450093885206529 2020-07-01 18:07:09 EDT <donna2808> @comcastcares @xfinity my box reads ‚Äú1LPSE‚Äù or it may be ‚ÄúLPSE‚Äù won‚Äôt reboot. No outages that I‚Äôm aware of in 21222. What‚Äôs up?
1278450039094984705 2020-07-01 18:06:56 EDT <vinnyvaz27> @RFTownship @FCC we need your help with our utilities, specifically xfinity services. We have been experiencing near daily, multiple times a day outages with our service, It‚Äôs getting worse. I‚Äôve reached out, but no resolution has come about. At my wits end.
1278448820062498816 2020-07-01 18:02:05 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked your My Account app? That will let you know whether there's an outage that's affecting your area.
1278448819701719044 2020-07-01 18:02:05 EDT <vinnyvaz27> @Xfinity @comcast @comcastcares a month and a half of regular, and ever increasing, multiple times a day service outages. My neighborhood has had enough of this, can we have a person of authority reach out to us, tell us what is being done to resolve this?  pic.twitter.com/skCykkEkfd
1278447211416899591 2020-07-01 17:55:42 EDT <MostHatedMeme> It‚Äôs been a outage since yesterday in my area almost 24hrs that‚Äôs what‚Äôs up with it ! Frustrated ü§¨
1278430502819631105 2020-07-01 16:49:18 EDT <mike_baxter22> Yo @Xfinity how is it that my internet has been out since yesterday, others in my neighborhood dealing with same thing, and yet we are not showing an outage or on outage map? Cannot wait for @ATT to get their Fiber service out this way.
1278427129668161537 2020-07-01 16:35:54 EDT <Xfinity> Sorry for the interruption! If you're in an area outage, be sure to keep an eye on the My Account app for updates.
1278426019767123968 2020-07-01 16:31:29 EDT <THECHAVO21> I was trying to do an early stream ( http://twitch.tv/thechavo21¬†) but my internet provider decided to have an outage.....thank you @Xfinity @comcast  100 gifted will do the trick!
1278414204303785986 2020-07-01 15:44:32 EDT <ReignJunco> Yea, when humans call they want to speak to a human not a robot that can‚Äôt comprehend anything. Also what‚Äôs up with the outage
1278409102855680003 2020-07-01 15:24:16 EDT <FwyHpod> @Xfinity just admit yall having outages, cause my internet is in and out all day everyday since March. Yall keep telling us to check the damn app WHICH DONT DO NOTHING BUT LIE LIKE YALL
1278404161592270854 2020-07-01 15:04:38 EDT <akatsukirobes> xfinity stay having outages but want us to pay full price for services
1278399006138339333 2020-07-01 14:44:09 EDT <BigHoss102> There has definitely been more outages than usual.
1278381032094478338 2020-07-01 13:32:43 EDT <GNoUnion> Nahhh @Xfinity pisses me off way too many outages when it thunderstorms I signed up for call back no one called back ü•¥ customer service lacking people gotta work from home we need Internet
1278374684032151552 2020-07-01 13:07:30 EDT <Xfinity> Use the link above and a support agent would be happy to discuss this outage with you.
1278372772792668161 2020-07-01 12:59:54 EDT <cowboysoup> Would just love to talk to a human, and get an answer. It‚Äôs a legit question. We are in unprecedented times, and our businesses have to change. Scheduling outages during the busiest times of the day doesn‚Äôt make sense when other options are available.
1278369051023216643 2020-07-01 12:45:07 EDT <bnewbs16> Really hard to work from home when @Xfinity has an outage for over two hours and counting. üôÑ
1278354120685105153 2020-07-01 11:45:47 EDT <LindaG46520104> Atlanta area has been having outages every other day, it‚Äôs disrupting work from home. Please let us know when service can be more stable.
1278353185531461632 2020-07-01 11:42:04 EDT <ripjuju_> Xfinity loves having these ‚Äú outages ‚Äú it‚Äôs annoying
1278352982611017728 2020-07-01 11:41:16 EDT <LindaG46520104> Same, outage every other day in the past two weeks in 30000 area. @Xfinity please let us know when service can be stable again
1278345624597954561 2020-07-01 11:12:02 EDT <Jbellis74> @Xfinity @comcastcares  you guys are making it incredibly hard to work from home. I‚Äôve had four outages in the last week.
1278342924384628739 2020-07-01 11:01:18 EDT <Xfinity> If the My Account app is still listing a service outage, then our techs are still working to get everything restored asap. We're sorry for the inconvenience this has caused, and be sure to monitor the app for any updates.
1278341669029584897 2020-07-01 10:56:18 EDT <ColG1977> The app showed an outage yesterday, but not today and we are still having major issues.
1278340636052258816 2020-07-01 10:52:12 EDT <lacucarochaaa> Xfinity reports an outage in the area. Baby‚Äôs pissed cause he was watching BichiKids. Time to go to grandmas ü§™
1278339832717156352 2020-07-01 10:49:01 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Colleen. Have you noticed if the Xfinity My Account app is showing a service outage?
1278339070255603713 2020-07-01 10:45:59 EDT <bringingtech2u> Started with an ‚Äúemergency outage‚Äù followed by tier 1 support to 1/5 normal speed. 90 minutes on hold & chat bot still no support  pic.twitter.com/IXU8ff88xy
1278337211092566022 2020-07-01 10:38:36 EDT <JessieClayson> @Xfinity just called and only can get automated assist. Twice tried to get a person and said there‚Äôs an outage in the area. I‚Äôm NOT CALLING ABOUT THAT!! But no wat to get through!!!!AHHHH!
1278334389156556800 2020-07-01 10:27:23 EDT <org_nofussruss> And more...lovely. @Xfinity, will we ever get reimbursed for all the outages!?!?  pic.twitter.com/3RThFOR25j
1278332635098632193 2020-07-01 10:20:25 EDT <DDangerfeld> And more...lovely. @Xfinity, will we ever get reimbursed for all the outages!?!?  pic.twitter.com/zgrSg8CoWH
1278331615870058496 2020-07-01 10:16:22 EDT <Xfinity> Hi JC, It seems like you've already found updates on your account, but continue to check the My Account app throughout the outage in case changes are made. If you need additional assistance reach out to support here on Twitter using this link:  https://xfin.tv/support¬†.
1278314721519771648 2020-07-01 09:09:14 EDT <vinnyvaz27> @comcastcares @xfinity @nbcchicago @ABC7Chicago I am really fed up with your lack of resolving why my neighborhood is having to deal with constant service outages that now occur multiple times a day, every single day. Does this need to be escalated?
1278287286401208321 2020-07-01 07:20:13 EDT <tiarashevon> Y‚Äôall need to fix this outage now. @Xfinity @comcast @comcastcares
1278222795638558721 2020-07-01 03:03:57 EDT <NavyLeo08> @Xfinity yall might wanna figure out what is causing the outage in the 22734 zip code area.
1278219514983993344 2020-07-01 02:50:55 EDT <theinfamousRIOT> Xfinity has a fucking outage right now üôÑ
1278201171786768387 2020-07-01 01:38:01 EDT <tomasitodatrain> Xfinity has an outage right now üòí üôÑ

1278139478532554752 2020-06-30 21:32:53 EDT <BenskiTheBard> Yo @RCNconnects, I am having another outage with Xfinity @Xfinity @comcastcares, when are you getting your boxes on my building to be working? I am ready to switch!!! New service 2 wks old, 2 outages! #internetshutdown #comcastoutage #betterservice #neverletmedown #xfinityoutage
1278136037299150849 2020-06-30 21:19:12 EDT <KingSimpson24> Anybody else having an @Xfinity outage? Ridiculous how it‚Äôs been going out so much the last few days.
1278133012375506946 2020-06-30 21:07:11 EDT <HeelChad> Day 4: @Xfinity still with the outages smh damn shame I can‚Äôt wait until this Pandemic is over so I can quit this service #BLM fastest service my ass üôÉ
1278132160264888320 2020-06-30 21:03:48 EDT <Memphis_sciz> Or don‚Äôt, too. Xfinity is a joke. There was an outage in my neighborhood 8 months ago. The ran a large ‚Äútemporary‚Äù cable the entire length of my backyard and in fact, the whole street. Still there. And still moving the goal posts on when it will be completed. 8 months
1278130242033463297 2020-06-30 20:56:10 EDT <BobbittJon> @Xfinity @comcast @comcastcares is horrible.  If you have an alternative that is good, don‚Äôt waste your money.  I‚Äôm on our fourth outage in 3 days.
1278130067764326401 2020-06-30 20:55:29 EDT <DemocracysBurnR> I had 4 internet outages since May 2 with #comcast  or #xfinity whatever they want to call themselves. If there was ANY other option that went down my street I would take it.
1278118821623103490 2020-06-30 20:10:48 EDT <DeepFusionAce> @comcastcares Missing out on all of #OHBM thanks to XFINITY outage here in beautiful Sandy Springs, GA...
1278118495469867008 2020-06-30 20:09:30 EDT <Xfinity> There were no outages reported in the area?
1278078134869463045 2020-06-30 17:29:07 EDT <CoxHelp> Hi, I am showing that we have a declared outage in the area currently. - Brian
1278070135501148160 2020-06-30 16:57:20 EDT <that_landon_bud> @Xfinity outage with a nearly 4 hour recovery estimate. It's all good, I don't need my job or anything. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø   @googlefiber, I miss you more with each passing day. pic.twitter.com/1Y09Fc4C6M
1278066227798212610 2020-06-30 16:41:48 EDT <sstsohg> I get mf internet outages every other day with xfinity
1278060629522288641 2020-06-30 16:19:33 EDT <Xfinity> The Xfinity My Account app will provide outage details, so be sure to check there for info on your location.
1278042562511597573 2020-06-30 15:07:46 EDT <John_A_W> And this, on possible city-wide @Xfinity outage:  "On 05/28/2020, 3 State of Minnesota IP address was published with information on exposed vulnerabilities. This address belongs to a non-state partner entity that has been contacted and is working to protect their systems."  5/
1278038612878266369 2020-06-30 14:52:04 EDT <KatiesOrr> Yes. We've checked it regularly as the internet goes in and out. It does tell us that there's outages.
1278032468755443712 2020-06-30 14:27:39 EDT <JoeSavoia> @Xfinity thank you for not resolving the outage until 4pm on a workday. Great stuff guys.  pic.twitter.com/bvR3GfQdd1
1278026372385058825 2020-06-30 14:03:26 EDT <TayeNicole> I need @Xfinity @comcastcares @comcast to schedule these outages around business hours. I have work to do.
1278022433577086976 2020-06-30 13:47:47 EDT <andril> @Xfinity outage again in #PembrokePines üëéüèø
1278022381311844353 2020-06-30 13:47:34 EDT <Khamdaddy_> @Xfinity all of these service outages are not cool. I can‚Äôt be having these interruptions while in class. üò≠üò≠üò≠
1278019425770377216 2020-06-30 13:35:50 EDT <warmsyrip> it has said y‚Äôall will be ‚Äúdoing some work in your area today‚Äù for about 4-5 days now, but it also says ‚Äúoutage type: unplanned‚Äù so it‚Äôs not very clear. also not trying to be rude but I don‚Äôt think going several days without connection qualifies as ‚Äúbrief interruptions‚Äù  pic.twitter.com/0lbTTvhW6N
1278010716486873088 2020-06-30 13:01:13 EDT <lalle09> @Xfinity  why are you doing maintenance in the middle of the work day???  Outage can last till 4pm?  WTH
1278002370258051072 2020-06-30 12:28:03 EDT <detacheddeviant> @Xfinity, we are undergoing the 2nd internet outage in 4 days. What‚Äôs going on? Please ensure that this doesn‚Äôt become the new normal. I can‚Äôt get work done with this many outages in a row.
1278001940522205184 2020-06-30 12:26:21 EDT <kitticatpat> When theres an xfinity internet outage and you have a meeting at noon üòå
1278000210413830144 2020-06-30 12:19:28 EDT <jayjoh88> @Xfinity Whats the status of internet outages in zip code 61107 ?
1278000053706203136 2020-06-30 12:18:51 EDT <eltrainPE> 2nd day in a row of a midday @Xfinity outage. Frustrating when 3 of us are working from home and rely on internet service.
1277992853499777031 2020-06-30 11:50:14 EDT <warm_detroit> @comcastcares @Xfinity @comcast how much longer are outages lasting? This has been almost 24 hours!  pic.twitter.com/COUsiU7Ttb
1277984896384774146 2020-06-30 11:18:37 EDT <ErinJBowles> Really @xfinity? This is the 4th internet outage we‚Äôve had during the workday in the past 3 months. What gives?
1277976609807454210 2020-06-30 10:45:42 EDT <LifeGaveyuLEMON> So xfinity is experiencing a power outage in my area until this afternoon...great
1277971902045151242 2020-06-30 10:26:59 EDT <CrystalGator1> @Xfinity @comcast What is going on?!?!  Outages and slow speeds for the last 24 hours?  Bellevue. WA completely dead right now!  @downdetector shows the outsge problems as well.  #NoInternet #HaveToWork
1277961126194577408 2020-06-30 09:44:10 EDT <robyn_stamps> I have more outages and issues with @Xfinity than actual service. Why don‚Äôt I ever get credited?! cause this is ridiculous
1277954544098578432 2020-06-30 09:18:01 EDT <HeelChad> Day 3: @Xfinity smh ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è again with the outages I barely woke up and my internet service is out again üò¨üò¨üò¨ you guys are a real piece of work #Overrated pic.twitter.com/hI183p0X0z
1277947655428210690 2020-06-30 08:50:38 EDT <frydfish37> No there is not any showing in the app. Also your customer service reps did not say anything about outages in the area.
1277944996289818625 2020-06-30 08:40:04 EDT <Xfinity> Hi. Thanks for reaching out. Is there an outage notification for you in the My Account app?
1277939052755537920 2020-06-30 08:16:27 EDT <JordanJamie> Me as well, but the outage map shows thousands right our my area.   I just don‚Äôt get the arbitrary times that keep getting blown by with no update, just changed time. First was 6:43pm, then 10:34pm, then 2:02am, now 10:07am. Why keep making up times? Also, no status updates?
1277938209838825472 2020-06-30 08:13:06 EDT <jjl_ice_yard> Yep. Same ZIP code even. Now they say it‚Äôll be back on at 10:07AM (oddly specific time).  When I got up at around 6AM today the app was telling me there were no outages in the area.  pic.twitter.com/t39D0o0Uqs
1277857821393063937 2020-06-30 02:53:40 EDT <MarleyBrooker> I guess it‚Äôs no Warzone tonight... thanks @Xfinity ü•∫ #Outage  pic.twitter.com/3Q8TB3LyV2
1277847369892184068 2020-06-30 02:12:08 EDT <Meika78> Why is xfinity having an outage when I need something to help me sleep
1277828111799857153 2020-06-30 00:55:37 EDT <spacollii> @comcast @Xfinity why do you guys literally always have a problem, like honestly my internet goes down once a week and it‚Äôs saying ‚ÄúUnExPeCtEd OuTaGe‚Äù BITCH,
1277810037138784256 2020-06-29 23:43:48 EDT <Teejey3DFS> Its so nice of @Xfinity to look out for me like this. They must know I've been watching too much TV and been spending too much time on my laptop. So they decided to give me an internet outage almost every day this month lasting hours at a time. Thanks guys!
1277809387172757504 2020-06-29 23:41:13 EDT <jjl_ice_yard> C‚Äômon @comcast and @Xfinity At 3PM you said it‚Äôs be resolved by 6:45PM. Since 6:30PM you‚Äôve been saying 10:30PM. Now 2:25AM? A 12-hour outage? #Unacceptable pic.twitter.com/HxtwqPafbS
1277782386303008768 2020-06-29 21:53:55 EDT <GregOMahony> It‚Äôs another one of the great service outage issues in my area. Resetting the system will not help me
1277743231120392198 2020-06-29 19:18:20 EDT <ChrisEOlive> Well, I hate to say it, but those outages and upgrades are probably them upgrading speeds and capacity. It's just "how" they do it that's pathetic. Internet is now a utility and needs to be handled as such. Unless AT&T have a great backbone? Most DSL providers can't touch cable.
1277738821539500032 2020-06-29 19:00:48 EDT <aluttrll> @Xfinity @comcastcares It‚Äôs very difficult to work from home when your internet is out all day with no real updates on the outage. I can‚Äôt call, because it‚Äôs flagged as an outage. The system hangs up on customers with an outage. My neighborhood has service üòí
1277731843630960645 2020-06-29 18:33:05 EDT <mohsenhatami> Twice so far has @Xfinity @comcast told me that I need to reset the modem or make an appointment, only to change the determination and say that we are facing a local outage scenario #xfinity #comcast #comcastoutage
1277729539725156354 2020-06-29 18:23:55 EDT <HeelChad> Again another outage @Xfinity really?!!! That‚Äôs twice in one fucking day I swear you guy need to quit lying to people. #YourServiceSucks pic.twitter.com/oupAMbuq7k
1277729406308487169 2020-06-29 18:23:24 EDT <Xfinity> Have you been experiencing area outages during this time? Or is there an issue with your equipment?
1277727491185086464 2020-06-29 18:15:47 EDT <mwclarke13> Mine has been going through outages and maintenance entire month of June, Calling AT&T tomorrow
1277721168221528067 2020-06-29 17:50:40 EDT <Xfinity> You can also check here:  https://xfin.tv/2YK6c4X¬†  If there is no outage reported, you can send us a DM at  https://xfin.tv/support¬† and our team can help.
1277715432909279233 2020-06-29 17:27:52 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked your My Account app to see if there's an outage reported in your area?
1277713717199867904 2020-06-29 17:21:03 EDT <nicosuave6> Internet outage going on 5 hours.
1277710490215616514 2020-06-29 17:08:14 EDT <jtl> @comcastcares @xfinity @comcastcares  Is there an outage in 60607?  Everything was fine until about 2:00 PM CDT.  Now my speeds are way down and the connection is dodgy.
1277705406555590664 2020-06-29 16:48:02 EDT <TobiAseks> Why are we having daily outages? @Xfinity fix your shit
1277702474007273472 2020-06-29 16:36:23 EDT <Xfinity> Hey there! Check the Xfinity My Account app for updates on the outage in your area.
1277699524228767745 2020-06-29 16:24:39 EDT <RizNasty3point0> @Xfinity it‚Äôs absolutely pathetic how often you‚Äôre having outages. The rate at which internet is dropping is not representative of node splitting at this point and quite frankly it‚Äôs unreliable service. Can you please inform of what‚Äôs going on? Wired ethernet connection mind you.
1277699188747362310 2020-06-29 16:23:19 EDT <KeeshGotHits> Aye @Xfinity y‚Äôall have had an outage all day.. like what‚Äôs going on
1277698877236314112 2020-06-29 16:22:05 EDT <InTheBleachers> yeah i did it w spectrum, especially when you tell them you're working from home and outage cost you. i do it with xfinity now in chicago
1277697376623484929 2020-06-29 16:16:07 EDT <RobynZinsgirl1> @Xfinity once again I‚Äôm in unplanned outage. This is 6th outage in 5 days. What‚Äôs going on? I need to find a new provider. @Xfinity IS THE WORST
1277695966418595840 2020-06-29 16:10:31 EDT <ReformerOfAll> @Xfinity once again leaves me without internet access for hours.  While I can afford to use my phone as a hotspot, there's like a subset of people who can both work from home and not afford the data charges.  These rolling internet outages are oppressive to those people
1277661628306272257 2020-06-29 13:54:04 EDT <Boy_II_Menace> Xfinity has an outage every other day...
1277659303567073281 2020-06-29 13:44:50 EDT <cnewman1> @Xfinity 4 days of outages in the last 7? Come on, we're trying to work here. #xfinity #Chicago
1277657582556061699 2020-06-29 13:38:00 EDT <lchval> @Xfinity @comcastcares we‚Äôve been having internet outages a few times a week for a while now, but it‚Äôs on a new level today. Internet has gone out five times this morning. Makes it pretty hard to work from home.
1277651039546757120 2020-06-29 13:12:00 EDT <AndreJJohnson9> @Xfinity Please explain how you can have multiple weekly outages but yet never seem to credit the monthly bill?
1277649936000053258 2020-06-29 13:07:36 EDT <MrSherman24> @VZWSupport I live in Rio Vista, CA and since about 4pm yesterday I have not had any cell service. I have WiFi through Xfinity so I‚Äôm still able to use my apps and send iMessages but I‚Äôm unable to send regular text messages or make calls. Is there an outage in my area? Help?
1277648308404707328 2020-06-29 13:01:08 EDT <JBurd89> I have looked for outages and have done troubleshooting on everything. And I‚Äôm not gonna call customer service because it‚Äôs about as useful as a hole in the bottom of a trash bag.
1277647801397268481 2020-06-29 12:59:08 EDT <XBOXDROID> Yea Monday üôå day 1 of stream wish me luck.  Hope @Xfinity @comcast don't have a outage....üôè
1277639758009827329 2020-06-29 12:27:10 EDT <Fuentastic> When @Xfinity reports an outage... "You get a day off!!! And you get a day off, and you get a day off!!!" #newnormal #takeyourtime pic.twitter.com/LscgkIM4Ap
1277633545624838144 2020-06-29 12:02:29 EDT <talk2alie> This is the 4th weekday and 6th day that my network has been interrupted. Every time I call @Xfinity, they say an agent is working on the problem. I'm a contractor, I am paid by the hr. If I can't work due to network outage, @Xfinity, who pays my bills?
1277632295667630080 2020-06-29 11:57:31 EDT <Bigbullybkp> It‚Äôs been atrocious bro been having Internet outages every week
1277629904947941377 2020-06-29 11:48:01 EDT <robertitomojito> Working from home would be a lot easier if @xfinity didn't constantly have outages in our area.
1277624007471357952 2020-06-29 11:24:35 EDT <stinkiepeach> Yes. There is another outage. This is the 3rd business day this has happened. We are working from home and this is causing huge issues.
1277617107069435904 2020-06-29 10:57:09 EDT <Bham_Girl> @Xfinity trying to report my 88 yr old neighbor‚Äôs landline outage and estimated phone wait time is 2 1/2 hours. Isn‚Äôt there a better way?
1277604459657392128 2020-06-29 10:06:54 EDT <StacyOrick> @xfinity @comcastcares is there an outage in Carmichael California?
1277595423134420994 2020-06-29 09:31:00 EDT <RebeccaShabad> Anyone in NW DC experiencing a cable & internet outage with Comcast? @Xfinity
1277576731008724994 2020-06-29 08:16:43 EDT <RenayCheyenne> When it‚Äôs an internet outage I feel I should get a discount on my bill for interrupted service @Xfinity
1277438793457508352 2020-06-28 23:08:36 EDT <ProfSalzer> @comcast @comcastcares @Xfinity the saga continues. Still no constant & consistent internet. 492 outages since 3/24, 50+ hours on chats, hold, or the phone, 3 new gateways/modems, multiple technician visits. When does it end?  If anyone out there has a choice, avoid Comcast.
1277413261726662656 2020-06-28 21:27:09 EDT <Chicagos_D> This is the second time @Xfinity has had an internet outage in one week. How can you promise internet to low-income families when you can provide stable internet to your ‚Äúpaying‚Äù customers. What are you going to provide them DSL speeds? How does this even happen?  pic.twitter.com/f3nYbTxGmB
1277390599126204416 2020-06-28 19:57:06 EDT <yahyamkassem> #xfinityoutage #xfinity #comcast Honestly I'm extremely dissatisfied with xfinity service, customer representatives and cost of service. I have been constantly receiving outages at my location. I have been told by your agents @ kung pow land that I would be receiving a $40 credit
1277336564415320071 2020-06-28 16:22:23 EDT <rickguyusa> @Xfinity @comcast please i want a refund for today‚Äôs outage!
1277330791702429698 2020-06-28 15:59:27 EDT <slongwell24> @Xfinity Your service is turning out to be second rate pos service. EVERY weekend your service has a fucking outage. Almost $200 a month and this is the shit fucking service we get? Fuck you CoNcast!
1277323567550644224 2020-06-28 15:30:44 EDT <rickguyusa> @comcast @Xfinity what time this outage will be fixed? This is taking all day now, very annoying!
1277321286721703940 2020-06-28 15:21:40 EDT <hillarx_> Can xfinity get their shit together and fix these dumbass outages. I have to work
1277321028616806401 2020-06-28 15:20:39 EDT <mmsden> @comcastcares Xfinity has to be the worse internet and cable TV provider in Colorado. Outages are constant and even when no outage strenghth is horrible. TV feed constantly stutters. This market would welcome competition
1277311490769457154 2020-06-28 14:42:45 EDT <DaRealFatBoi> Boy @Xfinity @comcast be having the most outages then anybody.... It‚Äôs not even raining and my WiFi out ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

1277271097403211784 2020-06-28 12:02:14 EDT <iGotThatFire247> @comcastcares my @Xfinity internet service has been suffering outages in my area for weeks -- am I going to receive a credit for not being able to tele-commute and conduct my business meetings?
1277228168886321152 2020-06-28 09:11:39 EDT <Ron_Sims> Optimum is just as bad, if not worse. My internet has been down for three days and getting in touch with customer service by phone, or Twitter has been impossible. Not even a statement to everyone acknowledging the outages, apologizing and reassuring us that it's being addressed.
1277145658051485697 2020-06-28 03:43:47 EDT <Sambee25> No CABLE all weekend due to #xfinity #comcast outage. Customer service is bullshit. I‚Äôm going to @optimum in August. Y‚Äôall could have it. Bye @Xfinity !!!

1277068469528395782 2020-06-27 22:37:04 EDT <SandRaider25> Hey @Xfinity we‚Äôre aware of an outage in our area, but I just got this message saying it won‚Äôt be fixed until Tuesday night?!?

1276969572885618688 2020-06-27 16:04:05 EDT <icarasX> @comcastcares internet is spotty as hell right now in my area. Had to quit watching on Apple TV because your internet crapped out on me. Now my Mac has zero internet. I tried checking the outage map on the Xfinity app on iPhone and it‚Äôs just giving me errors.
1276968104174682114 2020-06-27 15:58:15 EDT <AbrielleKOtto> @Xfinity I hope y‚Äôall plan on fixing my bill after taking into account the DAILY outages I‚Äôve been having... it‚Äôs getting a little ridiculous.

1276323150968561669 2020-06-25 21:15:26 EDT <Johnp26496263> It keeps saying there is an outage in my (FL miami) area but before it said it will be fixed within hours but now it been extended until 11:39PM
1276319419661275136 2020-06-25 21:00:37 EDT <Johnp26496263> My internet is out, there is outage in my area its been two hours and no signs of it being repaired
1276319255462662144 2020-06-25 20:59:58 EDT <Johnp26496263> @Xfinity my internet still is out and there is outage out. When will it be fixed it been hours. Its not fair, made sure all my bills are paid but outage can't be fixed quickly ?
1276316275816517634 2020-06-25 20:48:07 EDT <beyondd_beaut> There is no area outages as I can see on the app and my WiFi have been disconnecting all week
1276313521723146242 2020-06-25 20:37:10 EDT <apopnj01> @Xfinity - outage for over 5 hrs now in Katy Tx - can we get someone that knows that they are doing?
1276311468867293190 2020-06-25 20:29:01 EDT <YuLowry> @Xfinity Out internet service has been down due to an outage since this morning. We work from home this is not cool. The status continues to change and now says midnight for Atlanta. Dude!  pic.twitter.com/QJKfWBUEeU
1276305885242044417 2020-06-25 20:06:50 EDT <Xfinity> Be sure to check the Xfinity My Account app for updates on any area outages.
1276301639616528391 2020-06-25 19:49:58 EDT <Thrilluwu> We have to strangle Comcast every couple months to lift it, + internet outages.  Things have been better recently though, but I always got my eye on the speedtest.
1276301209335410688 2020-06-25 19:48:15 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Amy. We apologize for the frustration. Is the My Account app showing a service outage in your area?
1276297392057397249 2020-06-25 19:33:05 EDT <shaneratliff> @Xfinity since this seems to be the only way to get a human at your company, even with an outage, I thought I would try here.
1276296523739992065 2020-06-25 19:29:38 EDT <KellyKDM1> Not at all.. missed appointments then when they came out the guy said there's nothing more that he can do.  There's no support beam.. so I'll have to deal with this forever. Now there's an outage in this area
1276290574086221825 2020-06-25 19:05:59 EDT <Cypress38J> Hey @xfinity, why am I paying you assholes so much money for WiFi if there‚Äôs an outage every fucking day?  Fix your shit.
1276289749322469377 2020-06-25 19:02:43 EDT <Xfinity> Hey. Does the My Account app still list the area outage?
1276285008056070155 2020-06-25 18:43:52 EDT <Xfinity> Is the My Account app showing any internet outages in your area?
1276278667505786880 2020-06-25 18:18:41 EDT <doxmontoya> Yes it does, it says Xfinity Channels outage but if that is the case, then how am I connected to my neighbor's xfinity signal...
1276276991944253450 2020-06-25 18:12:01 EDT <ccdolfan> You must live in the same area as me. It's now 6:10PM and they've updated their message to say they are trying to retore as soon as possible. @Xfinity what's the deal with the 6+ hour outage? @verizonfios help!!
1276270065038643203 2020-06-25 17:44:30 EDT <schabel22> No. It almost never says there is even an outage. This one lasted about 2 hours, just like yesterday.
1276267411478589443 2020-06-25 17:33:57 EDT <illavitas> alright so i‚Äôm not getting any help with this @Xfinity service outage because it says i don‚Äôt have any service interruptions??? bro. my modem has been unplugged and plugged in and rechecked a hundred times and it‚Äôs OFF it won‚Äôt turn on. LIKE I NEED UPDATES TOO I NEED HELP TOO
1276264976978673664 2020-06-25 17:24:17 EDT <MayaRiyah> I have to use my pto bc @Xfinity wants to have an outage all day
1276253284752216065 2020-06-25 16:37:49 EDT <opinionatedbas> @Xfinity This is getting so old for how Unbelievably expensive Xfinity is to have an outage once a week is ridiculous the technician I spoke to in my area told me two months ago that they‚Äôre trying to find out why it keeps happening
1276251902418788354 2020-06-25 16:32:19 EDT <11Laguna11> @Shentel internet is absolute GARBAGE!! We pay an arm and a leg for 300M Unlimited yet we are only getting up to 35M. Outages every week. WTF is this old ass crap??? @verizonfios @Xfinity Y'all come take our money! Everybody is READY FOR BETTER SERVICE!! #CampbellCounty
1276251076346470411 2020-06-25 16:29:02 EDT <yofaneto> The service just isn‚Äôt working how it should. I checked for outages and it says there‚Äôs ‚Äúnone in my area‚Äù but I know damn well somethings wrong because there are several other people complaining about this for weeks.
1276250921782120448 2020-06-25 16:28:26 EDT <robotrobb> @Xfinity the outage in my area is going on 4+ hours at this point. The estimated time they gave us was 4:04pm and it's now 4:27, all services are still out and there is now no time estimate for it to be fixed.
1276250785790255107 2020-06-25 16:27:53 EDT <Xfinity> Hey. Does the Xfinity My Account app list a service outage affecting your location?
1276241710297739265 2020-06-25 15:51:49 EDT <philozopher> WFH Tech Blues: when your high-peed Internet shifts from your cable modem to LTE tethering through your mobile. Glad for the backup, but why does @Xfinity have an outage during the day, when I‚Äôm working?  #FirstWorldProblems  http://xfinity.com/status¬† pic.twitter.com/FGtRmuzZsU
1276231698913640448 2020-06-25 15:12:02 EDT <purpl3f0xsec> Still having frequent outages. Talked to @Xfinity support again. Explained everything including previous troubleshooting. So what do they do? Remotely reboot my modem after I tell them NOT to because I'm currently working from home and need my connection.
1276229709693685760 2020-06-25 15:04:08 EDT <DemonicaLevette> I‚Äôm so sick of xfinity and it‚Äôs outages üò≠

1276227818284818435 2020-06-25 14:56:37 EDT <Xfinity> Is the My Account app showing any service outages in your area?
1276225665205972992 2020-06-25 14:48:04 EDT <schabel22> @xfinity So is there going to be an outage of internet every afternoon?  If so, please let your paying customers know so we can an accordingly. ..working from home with computer and internet phone is pretty much impossible without internet.
1276219285539401728 2020-06-25 14:22:43 EDT <VASunlver> @Xfinity @comcastcares cable out Wednesday night and again now (Thursday morning). Tried to report app tells me there are outages around me.

1276180978394898432 2020-06-25 11:50:30 EDT <GianDoh> @comcastcares @Xfinity hi folks, two internet outages so far today. How do you expect me to research my dirty jokes?!
1276177678245048320 2020-06-25 11:37:23 EDT <Jessyc54> Yeah I wouldn‚Äôt waste my time on the phone with them. If I ever had a problem it lasted like 30min.  But rn there‚Äôs a outage.
1276172950715142149 2020-06-25 11:18:36 EDT <Xfinity> We can look into what's going on. Are you seeing any outage information in your My Account app?

1276159043304927241 2020-06-25 10:23:20 EDT <DrJMcM> Another outage?!? Great job helping those of us working from home! Looking up alternative internet providers now....
1276156173092294656 2020-06-25 10:11:56 EDT <wildbandwagon> I woke up to a text from Xfinity saying my neighborhood had an outage...had to drag my ass into the office today. ü§¨
1276088444192788485 2020-06-25 05:42:48 EDT <Epling94> Like tbh every time there‚Äôs an internet outage like this @comcast @Xfinity should push back payment dates to give back the time we lost when we could‚Äôve been online! I‚Äôm just saying... #Outage #INeedMyWifi #Help
1276044890007371778 2020-06-25 02:49:44 EDT <RichJMoney> Apparently there‚Äôs an @Xfinity outage in my area. RIP stream.
1276041293236506624 2020-06-25 02:35:26 EDT <Radio_kilahOx> I‚Äôm tired of Xfinity having these outages every week. I just wanna watch my movie  pic.twitter.com/JL98in0f4Z
1276027836197896192 2020-06-25 01:41:58 EDT <ChrisEOlive> Looks like @Xfinity @Comcast thinks a consumer ‚Äúroutine maintenance outage‚Äù of **6 hours** is acceptable.  Does the electric company do this, @Xfinity @comcast?! NO. They don‚Äôt.  This is completely unacceptable. pic.twitter.com/REKLBhD3AJ
1276023718809079812 2020-06-25 01:25:36 EDT <Kid_Helios> Its 1:24 in the morning and xfinity is have a internet outage and I cant sleep. What a time to be not asleep.

1275974783696547841 2020-06-24 22:11:09 EDT <IB_FlyGuy> @Xfinity Y‚Äôall really got the nerve to not have any reps available to speak with and then when you try to talk to a rep online or receive a credit for an outage you tell people they aren‚Äôt eligible for a credit. Y‚Äôall are trash for this shit.

1275914589402628096 2020-06-24 18:11:58 EDT <Jinhaicat> Xfinity is starting to show outage around San Jose/Santa Clara   (I also have an outage and also in south bay)
1275910664306020354 2020-06-24 17:56:22 EDT <nina_nfuentes> Way to go @Xfinity! You just caused an outage during peak usage, a half hour into my 3-hour conference call. Why couldn't you schedule service calls overnight or not in the middle of the workday?

1275875194339577856 2020-06-24 15:35:25 EDT <Sarahwo82069940> @Xfinity @comcastcares What‚Äôs going on with the SF outages? It‚Äôs been going on for more than 24 hours!!! And you keep giving a timeline, and then cancelling it! I work from home and this is ridiculous!!!
1275871901408264196 2020-06-24 15:22:20 EDT <tonysantucci> @Xfinity  why does my internet go down at least twice a week and when I speak to an agent they tell me my house does not have an outage? Is this some sort of shady practice to hide how many outages each customer has? I‚Äôm out now and was told there is outage in my area but not me?  pic.twitter.com/K6Kj2Ity26
1275867887756963840 2020-06-24 15:06:23 EDT <LaurenoLauren> If you‚Äôre going to work on the internet why not do it on the weekend. This is the second day I‚Äôve had an internet outage @Xfinity and I work from home. This is cutting into my PTO time come on guys HELP ME OUT. 2020 has really not been my year
1275858278866546688 2020-06-24 14:28:12 EDT <ShadoMagi> With how dependent we all are on the internet right now with the stay at home. It would be nice to be able to see some sort of incident report or root cause when an outage does happen even if it is only 30 minutes.
1275856833811488769 2020-06-24 14:22:28 EDT <craftbrain> We‚Äôre having issues in the Bay Area too but our account says no outage. Is there an outage in the whole area?
1275855661021179909 2020-06-24 14:17:48 EDT <ShadoMagi> That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying doesn‚Äôt say has an outage. I see something for my zip code but the same page says ‚ÄúNo service outages for your address‚Äù
1275854973109141506 2020-06-24 14:15:04 EDT <ShadoMagi> @Xfinity seems like everything but your own outage map says there‚Äôs a major outage right now in the Bay Area.
1275849695999537153 2020-06-24 13:54:06 EDT <Xfinity> Hey! You can check your My Account app to see if there's an outage reported in your area.

1275837518081114118 2020-06-24 13:05:42 EDT <Bestowed_Beauty> I find it crazy that @Xfinity has an outage during the week while I‚Äôm at home working. This is BS
1275831676518703104 2020-06-24 12:42:30 EDT <svengali_aiuola> @Xfinity The IVR is painfully inadequate and appears to be designed to prevent a customer from reaching an Agent, which prolongs the time to resolution for an unplanned outage. üôÑüòë
1275824568133967873 2020-06-24 12:14:15 EDT <tyeshaj082> Once again @Xfinity is showing me why I need to leave them alone for good. 7 outages this month...WFH is really me not doing work at all. üôÑüôÑ

I probably won‚Äôt get a refund with you and my cell phone bill will probably go up because I‚Äôve been using the hotspot. Are you going to do anything? #fixit pic.twitter.com/DegFsc6RyK
1275808248084471808 2020-06-24 11:09:24 EDT <Scoe_Soprano> Can‚Äôt stream until @Xfinity fix my upload instead is saying it‚Äôs a outage for weeks they should chop my bill in half since I‚Äôm only getting half the service
1275797353388298240 2020-06-24 10:26:06 EDT <jomatt947> @Xfinity @comcastcares How am I supposed to work remotely without internet? #outage
1275794132892635136 2020-06-24 10:13:19 EDT <sxekush> These Xfinity outages happening too much
1275782811472015360 2020-06-24 09:28:19 EDT <jrgray> So @xfinity @comcastcares was in my neighborhood doing work last week and my Internet has been intermittent ever since. Today we have an outage that they say can't be resolved until 12PM.  Do you not understand people are working from home?  #comcastdoesntcare
1275777806815772672 2020-06-24 09:08:26 EDT <Ashlee_withanE> Finding it really tough to work from home when @Xfinity has unplanned outages throughout all of #SF. Resolution ETA just shifted from 0630 to 1000. I‚Äôve been taking meetings on my phone since 3am so this will be an almost completely unproductive day. ‚òπÔ∏è Unacceptable, y‚Äôall. pic.twitter.com/2M7tFOMIq0
1275776821548769281 2020-06-24 09:04:31 EDT <ohserg> @comcastcares @comcast @Xfinity is there an outage in Homestead, FL?
1275759236920807426 2020-06-24 07:54:39 EDT <sapp_nichole> @Xfinity Do Better! Still not getting service after 2 weeks and 2 techs sent to home! But, your still charging me. This has been happening since your outage in my area. Before that all was fine. I need to work from home to earn money to pay you.
1275720724062363648 2020-06-24 05:21:37 EDT <andyatthemovies> Second night in a row with @Xfinity having an outage. CV peeps, any alternatives? Xfinity sucks.
1275717431374286849 2020-06-24 05:08:31 EDT <JeffJ1968> @Xfinity is there an outage in the Renton area?
1275695955849949184 2020-06-24 03:43:11 EDT <abhinav_kr> Xfinity outage in my area. I can't turn off the lights in my room. FML.
1275691279125565442 2020-06-24 03:24:36 EDT <LegendGary323> New PSU to try and fix our major issue! And then I get cucked by @Xfinity with an outage in the area....  pic.twitter.com/A2i3RU1aAV
1275673184549953536 2020-06-24 02:12:42 EDT <Dan12Dempsey> 2nd outage this month... @Xfinity what the hell is going on?
1275672717359013891 2020-06-24 02:10:51 EDT <juansansonjr> @Xfinity outage in Lacey, WA, any updates. Someone cut the wire again??
1275632446617378822 2020-06-23 23:30:50 EDT <DaleWBurke1> Yep, pretty much every overhead garage door has one. Even those with electric openers have to have a pull rope attached to a quick disengagement lever which allows the door to be opened manually during power outages or emergencies.
1275616646472716288 2020-06-23 22:28:02 EDT <MrRichards157> So glad I pay full price @Xfinity for there to be an some type of outage @comcastcares. My bill should be prorated for the downtime. #Comcast #Xfinity  pic.twitter.com/TGSYqxueuz
1275604354649731078 2020-06-23 21:39:12 EDT <rumorhasitall> Hey @Xfinity, I‚Äôve been waiting for a solid 4 hours for this ‚Äúoutage‚Äù to get fixed, what‚Äôs up with that?
1275603066335760389 2020-06-23 21:34:05 EDT <Cupseyy> Nice bro xfinity has an outage when I have gold p90 4 splashes 6 minis and a pad with max mats
1275585538016321537 2020-06-23 20:24:26 EDT <SocMedSean> @Xfinity internet reliability sucks. Three four-hour outages in one week. Quick tip: Less time/money on sponsoring sports, more time/money on making your service work.
1275580958880813058 2020-06-23 20:06:14 EDT <Talayuh> @xfinity @comcastcares please tell me why there is yet another outage in my area that won‚Äôt be fixed until 11:32 pm. You do know folks work from home right ?
1275533487240609793 2020-06-23 16:57:36 EDT <Kaiiius3> it isn't on my end everytime we call its an outage in the area
1275529553490989059 2020-06-23 16:41:58 EDT <VelazMike92> I‚Äôve had ‚Äúoutages‚Äù 6 days in a row all around 3-5 pm. Currently another outage in my area.
1275523488128925696 2020-06-23 16:17:52 EDT <Xfinity> Does your My Account app indicate that you're in an area outage?
1275520430649065473 2020-06-23 16:05:43 EDT <Xfinity> Havw you checked your My Account app to see if you're in an area outage?
1275513731594760192 2020-06-23 15:39:06 EDT <E19Gary> @Xfinity I‚Äôve had nothing but outages and all you care about is restarting YOUR equipment. I have had service dropped 31 times in 60 minutes, then you won‚Äôt take a phone call to JUST say your sorry.
1275505921074970626 2020-06-23 15:08:03 EDT <thebigmike24_> Yo @Xfinity can u fix my internet? I‚Äôm trying to stream and it keeps going downüò§I can‚Äôt do my job without it.   Soooo...fix it? Please?  There have been outages for a week. It goes up, then it goes down. MAKE UP YOUR MIND.   I‚Äôll be waiting üòâ
1275493456970780673 2020-06-23 14:18:32 EDT <GIS_DOG> @comcastcares @Xfinity probably one of the worst experiences I have had with customer service in a LONG time. Xfinity internet outage,no reason given,all I get is robots to talk too,trying to work from home, but its impossible with this #HORRIBLE internet service.  #xfinityoutage
1275493372304723970 2020-06-23 14:18:12 EDT <heather_rode> Hey @comcast @Xfinity.... want to explain the daily outages that are constantly happening in my area. Nobody will give me a straight answer. It's getting really old paying so much for services that continuously don't work.
1275493356206993413 2020-06-23 14:18:08 EDT <jpenate2005> @Xfinity I consider myself a patient person, but to be left on hold for an hour and 23 minutes is just fucking ridiculous. To report an outage! Do better! Especially in a time where you should be fucking thriving!  pic.twitter.com/llF1kbnGT8
1275492515362324482 2020-06-23 14:14:47 EDT <missouttamyway> Internet is down every fucking day for a month. This is me still on hold from this afternoon‚Äôs outage.  @Xfinity @comcastcares pic.twitter.com/h4N96AC6oU
1275486147007836161 2020-06-23 13:49:29 EDT <Staxxx_Morris> @Xfinity  you absolutely fucked me today with that outage.
1275480429953507328 2020-06-23 13:26:46 EDT <DonutRush> @Xfinity some real galaxy brain outage planning here
1275462429812670464 2020-06-23 12:15:14 EDT <Lmalloy12> You know what's ironic? Trying to check the @Xfinity Outage Map in DC and realizing you can't even check it because you don't have internet.  pic.twitter.com/9ttxB2clOz
1275457323373223941 2020-06-23 11:54:57 EDT <_TheLawww> Xfinity pissing me off!  Bitch gone say it‚Äôs an outage in the area but she don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm affected   Bitch obvisiouly I am if I‚Äôm calling ya stupid ass! üòë
1275456300327948288 2020-06-23 11:50:53 EDT <JenniLynneD> They are not related to any outages. Unless the outages have been occurring for months like my issues have been. My employer‚Äôs IT unit states that these issues are unique to employees who use Comcast rather than another provider.
1275456269998911491 2020-06-23 11:50:46 EDT <Xfinity> We apologize for the downtime, we understand staying connected is important. We can credit your bill due to this outage. DM us here:  https://xfin.tv/support¬† üëà
1275455869375918081 2020-06-23 11:49:10 EDT <Xfinity> Have the interruptions been outage related? Have you seen anything in your My Account app?
1275447689342095365 2020-06-23 11:16:40 EDT <britlikeswit> If y‚Äôall keep having outages are y‚Äôall running us refunds on our bills? @Xfinity   This is the second outage in less than a month.
1275444749093048321 2020-06-23 11:04:59 EDT <Xfinity> Hi, Jeremy! We hate to see you having issues. Are you seeing any outage information showing in your My Account app?
1275442964945203207 2020-06-23 10:57:54 EDT <DrJMcM> @Xfinity thanks for the extended outage that caused me to miss an important meeting this morning! Still no connection - this ‚Äúscheduled maintenance‚Äù sure is taking a long time!!!
1275437938357047302 2020-06-23 10:37:55 EDT <sbmarchert> I just love it when @Xfinity has an internet outage in the morning, right when everyone who‚Äôs teleworking is trying to sign on to work üôÉ
1275433814517407745 2020-06-23 10:21:32 EDT <MonasticObserv1> #verizon AND #xfinity outage in Colorado?!!! Who's gonna cover my loss of income? #outage #internet #service
1275427262800760833 2020-06-23 09:55:30 EDT <Xfinity> We can take a look into what's going on. Have you been having any area outage issues showing in your My Account app during this time?
1275422994974867457 2020-06-23 09:38:32 EDT <ScottD37841912> @comcastcares extremely disappointed, so many people required to work from home & xfinity decides to do routine maint. for half a day on a workday. understandable if outage, but maint. with no notification?! Would they be happy if their employees at home couldn‚Äôt work?? I bet not
1275422391196401670 2020-06-23 09:36:08 EDT <ScottD37841912> @Xfinity extremely disappointed, so many people required to work from home and xfinity decide to do routine maint. for half a day on a workday. understandable if outage, but maint. with no notification?!

1275420145272467456 2020-06-23 09:27:13 EDT <natalia5727> Nationwide outage again?
1275414823166193669 2020-06-23 09:06:04 EDT <christare79> @comcast & @Xfinity Daily outages in my area are completely unacceptable!  People are working from home during this pandemic and I can‚Äôt work without the internet. I pay too damn much to have daily outages. Time to change providers? #Unacceptable #comcast #xfinity
1275398650701639680 2020-06-23 08:01:48 EDT <cackymonger> So, if these outages are 'routine', why do I never know when they will happen, @Xfinity @comcast @comcastcares ? Not a fan of waking up for my job at 3:30 AM to discover I have no internet. pic.twitter.com/OuTkLMTkrO
1275340062738321414 2020-06-23 04:09:00 EDT <wikiSSB> Xfinity be like:  Service outage every 30 minutes
1275316217805508608 2020-06-23 02:34:15 EDT <cmykchicago> @Xfinity what‚Äôs the deal with these outages? Second in less than two weeks. How routine is this going to be?  pic.twitter.com/Id60A1n6fa
1275244528287481858 2020-06-22 21:49:23 EDT <Xfinity> We're sorry for the inconvenience the interruption has caused, and our techs are working to get everything restored asap. Please keep checking the My Account app for outage updates and alerts.
1275236377173520385 2020-06-22 21:16:59 EDT <Djscotty14> @Xfinity outage for 1/2 day. Most of the neighborhood is out but of course @Xfinity customer service says there is not an outage.  How do we our internet back?!?!
1275223242475798529 2020-06-22 20:24:48 EDT <MCMartirone> Dear @Xfinity I‚Äôve had an outage for over ten hours. What seems be the problem and when will this be resolved?
1275220948644487169 2020-06-22 20:15:41 EDT <Sierra_Alyse> Ok @Xfinity ... I've patient for a few hours. What the heck is going on with these internet outages???  We pay way too much for me to not be able to work from home on a consistent basis. Fix it. NOW.  #comcastoutage üôÑ
1275211238465851393 2020-06-22 19:37:06 EDT <DCarp1231> An outage was reported and it won‚Äôt be fixed until 11:05 PM EST. How accurate is that?
1275206533823918080 2020-06-22 19:18:24 EDT <aprilrhood> @Xfinity @comcast @comcastcares Is there an outage of LANDLINES in Indianapolis righ now? I‚Äôm trying to reach my family there and the call either fails or you get an error message from ‚ÄúVerizon Wireless‚Äù stating you have called an invalid number. WHAT‚ÄôS GOING ON?!üò≥
1275206398318690305 2020-06-22 19:17:52 EDT <JasonYasner> @comcastcares @xfinity Major internet and telephone outages all throughout Washington DC today. Do something about it! #furious #nosupport #switchingtofios
1275168384775266305 2020-06-22 16:46:49 EDT <stewpeanut> @comcastcares @Xfinity @comcast we have experienced a 30-90 min internet outage nearly every day for the past several weeks (Chicago) This is incredibly disruptive as many are working from home and rely on a stable service.  When is this going to be resolved?
1275166998423646209 2020-06-22 16:41:18 EDT <JCWhittington_> No, I am not able to sign into the app. Is there an outage map available that I do not have to sign into to see ?
1275166242433839106 2020-06-22 16:38:18 EDT <Xfinity> Hi JC. The Xfinity My Account app will provide info for any service outages that are affecting your location. Are you able to check the app?
1275165710348693506 2020-06-22 16:36:11 EDT <JCWhittington_> @Xfinity is there an outage in Bowie, Maryland ?
1275156843094921217 2020-06-22 16:00:57 EDT <thebigmike24_> I‚Äôll be back tomorrow!  Internet is REALLY screwing up my plans.   Xfinity keeps having outagesüò§  Origins tomorrow!
1275148463576055808 2020-06-22 15:27:39 EDT <dricadee> @Xfinity come fix this wifi outage mane
1275144929187106818 2020-06-22 15:13:36 EDT <FisherTrueLine> XFinity sporadic internet outages again today in Alexandria, VA. Wiping out school work and business activity. Time lost, grades suffer, and work not completed because of Comcast. We're hurt, Comcast isn't.  I wish we could get reliable service or our money back for damages.
1275138129167560710 2020-06-22 14:46:35 EDT <Xfinity> Hi. Does the My Account app indicate that you're still in an area outage?
1275136894443982849 2020-06-22 14:41:41 EDT <RealityTVAddic5> @Xfinity @comcast @comcastcares clearly do not care. I wonder if CenturyLink, AT&T Fiber, Verizon Fios, Optimum, or Cox want our business! Xfinity is GIVING AWAY customers with their outages and customer service response!
1275126273954717699 2020-06-22 13:59:29 EDT <forthagorls> I restarted it multiple times, tried to talk to CS, unplugged to a different outlet, checked for outages (there are none), followed all the steps in the app
1275124453198852097 2020-06-22 13:52:14 EDT <JaneEscalante5> I missed my Exam because of the outageüò¢
1275116368493453318 2020-06-22 13:20:07 EDT <aIexxxis> Someone please tell me why @Xfinity thinks it‚Äôs okay to have an internet outage for over 24 hours at this point during a pandemic when everyone is working from home?....
1275116169436057608 2020-06-22 13:19:19 EDT <marasantanaaa> @Xfinity so I‚Äôm going to assume you‚Äôre going to be providing a credit to everyone working from home unable to produce $ for the past 4 hours thanks to your outage, right? This happens way too oftenü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1275111013390614529 2020-06-22 12:58:50 EDT <miloandmisty> @Xfinity why do I have to keep signing up for service outage texts every time? Why isn‚Äôt this info stored somewhere to auto text. And ANOTHER outage???? People are trying to work from home with no internet for 4 more hours????
1275109660081750017 2020-06-22 12:53:28 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked the Xfinity My Account app? There may be maintenance or an outage in the area.
1275107421225132032 2020-06-22 12:44:34 EDT <804forever> @Xfinity fix your outage map please
1275106808055631873 2020-06-22 12:42:08 EDT <Matt___Moore> I‚Äôve had your motem for about 6 months and on at least every few weeks there‚Äôs either been an outage or I‚Äôve had to reset it. You run a monopoly in western PA and most of the state so at least have a reliable service if you have so many captive customers!
1275101850031788034 2020-06-22 12:22:25 EDT <_NubianGoddesss> @Xfinity I‚Äôve literally had to reset my wifi router 3 times today while working from home.  At this point, the issue is costing me money. Is their an outage right now? What is going on???????
1275098644715274243 2020-06-22 12:09:41 EDT <hailey_such> @Xfinity I need to speak with a representative. You have raise my internet expense AGAIN. After we discussed that would not happen. On top of that the service has been terrible and I am yet again unable to work due to an outage. So you charge me more and I lose a day of pay!!!
1275093682534993921 2020-06-22 11:49:58 EDT <GeorgetteGinter> @Xfinity Yet again - another outage affecting Forest Glen/Jefferson Pk that is hindering my ability to #WFH!  3rd time in 7 days!#DoSomething
1275091766270722054 2020-06-22 11:42:21 EDT <Xfinity> Hi. You can keep an eye on your My Account app for updates on an outage. For help with your account, send us a message at  https://xfin.tv/support¬† .
1275090791829065728 2020-06-22 11:38:29 EDT <mrbpconnelly> @Xfinity still no update on the service outage in Northern Virginia. There should definitely be refunds issued due to not being provided a service we paid for. There needs to be accountability by ISPs.
1275087041026494470 2020-06-22 11:23:35 EDT <LemonbrownG> Also stream is dead for now due to me having Xfinity Dogshit internet. There's been an outage that has me getting kicked from matches 3 times, especially during fights. So once that's sorted we will be back and back STRONK.
1275086801284354048 2020-06-22 11:22:38 EDT <stinkiepeach> @Xfinity is KILLING me with all these outages. We‚Äôre all working from home, we need internet üôÑ
1275085459908177920 2020-06-22 11:17:18 EDT <dwightthemayor> Considering @Xfinity for Internet again (ugh) because @CenturyLinkHelp doesn't seem to have a reliable update for this service outage and I need to work. One big question, though-does Xfinity still have data caps? And can I get Internet without a bundle?
1275083030345011201 2020-06-22 11:07:38 EDT <nessundorma214> Hey @comcast @Xfinity , my internet has been having "micro outages" for the past few week. Down for a few seconds every 10 min for a few hours. Bad for telework! Can you help?
1275079653313527810 2020-06-22 10:54:13 EDT <mrbpconnelly> @Xfinity another day, another internet outage. Makes one wonder where all that money we give you is spent. Customers should get a one day refund for everyday there is an outrage in a month. #accountability
1275076981441232899 2020-06-22 10:43:36 EDT <Xfinity> We understand the frustration, we're working to fix this sooner. We can assist with your bill due to this outage. Send us a DM here:  https://xfin.tv/support¬† üëà
1275076711239938049 2020-06-22 10:42:32 EDT <merlinpatt77> You should get @ask_trim. It's a service that can negotiate a lower bill on your behalf automatically when an outage like this happens. You only pay some percentage of what you save   https://www.asktrim.com/¬†
1275074802131152904 2020-06-22 10:34:57 EDT <CarolynSmithPR> Yes, by 2:30 p.m., which means I lose 4hrs of my workday. Xfinity needs to adjust pricing of services if there are going to be continuous outages, like the ones I‚Äôve experienced. My primary reason for considering other service providers. I pay too much for iffy service.
1275071692897832968 2020-06-22 10:22:35 EDT <CarolynSmithPR> And here we are again, dealing with a what? Yet another @Xfinity outage during prime work hours üôÑ
1275052646873935877 2020-06-22 09:06:55 EDT <wkrtsinwndrlust> Anyone else in Southie experiencing an @Xfinity outage or just me? No outages reported via app and earliest tech apt tomorrow. So much for working today @universalhub @maureencaught
1275017852307849217 2020-06-22 06:48:39 EDT <dreamlovedefine> Fix the wifi outages then
1275000959333068800 2020-06-22 05:41:31 EDT <guksdior> why is there outages literally every other day @Xfinity im about to change services
1274969126755164163 2020-06-22 03:35:02 EDT <aongusb> @comcastcares Mountain View CA here.  Our internet just went down but xfinity public wifi unavailable too. Outage?
1274944354440773632 2020-06-22 01:56:36 EDT <F8Afiya> What‚Äôs going on with the internet? Why is there is an outage?! @Xfinity üòë
1274932364091645952 2020-06-22 01:08:57 EDT <koslain> What helped me was tracking information using pingplotter. for 2 weeks. When I got a tech to show up, I showed him the pings from the NIC, the modem and google and it tracked outages. In my case, a MoCA filter was missing is what the tech said. They got it fixed though. Good luck
1274895465482457092 2020-06-21 22:42:20 EDT <ma_mjoy> Still no response and no resolution to the outage @Xfinity @comcast
1274884296227127301 2020-06-21 21:57:57 EDT <ape_apeee> Xfinity got a outage now I can‚Äôt watch tv üòí
1274873093069197313 2020-06-21 21:13:26 EDT <JazhPn> I‚Äôve gone over 60 days with outages just about everyday...if you have another decent option you should switch.   I don‚Äôt have another option...
1274872499780620289 2020-06-21 21:11:04 EDT <brandonj30000> @Xfinity there is an outage in my area how long ussaly are outages until the WiFi gets back up and running ?
1274869347601854464 2020-06-21 20:58:33 EDT <michardillo> Please explain the outages every day since Friday in 20853. So annoying especially since we have phone, internet and tv with you guys. How can we work and use our devices like this???? #noservice #xfrustrating
1274861085326217222 2020-06-21 20:25:43 EDT <DonDelillo69> @comcastcares why is there an xfinity internet outage in downtown memphis, tennessee?
1274860273095053318 2020-06-21 20:22:29 EDT <ceasterday> I hate @Xfinity so much. Currently telling me there's no outage for my address online. But my internet is out, and there's an outage reported for my neighbors, but they claim I'm not a part of it.
1274859423857553411 2020-06-21 20:19:07 EDT <BoonieBreakdown> Like y'all saying no outage, but I pay alot of money a month to not have internet speeds this low!  pic.twitter.com/iFhw9LIa5U
1274856570346668032 2020-06-21 20:07:46 EDT <BoonieBreakdown> it is an outage in my zipcode but saying I am not affected, but I can not upload anything without it saying it will take 7 hours. WHAT IS GOING ON!
1274855141129228289 2020-06-21 20:02:05 EDT <Xfinity> You can stay updated through the Xfinity My Account app on all outage information.

1274843601948860417 2020-06-21 19:16:14 EDT <ma_mjoy> @Xfinity all services have been out for over 5hrs! Services were to be restored by 6:08pm cst, at 6:08pm @Xfinity updated the time to 9:58pm cst. This is outrageous, there have been consistent outages in this area of Memphis TN over the past month and no one is saying why!!!
1274839200320442368 2020-06-21 18:58:45 EDT <NocXeros> Xfinity back on its bs " An XFINITY Services outage has been reported in your area. We're working hard to get your service up and running. The issue will be resolved 06/21/2020 09:33 PM (Central). Thank you for your patience."
1274803458110038018 2020-06-21 16:36:43 EDT <RaeStxx> Not an xfinity outage till 8pm üò©
1274801027879968768 2020-06-21 16:27:04 EDT <jagtap_lalit> @TMobile is the best since we switched for ATT 8 years ago. Plus the hotspots saves me from ‚Äúintermittent outages of @Xfinity @comcat @comcastcares I wish Comcast pays some of my payments to @TMobile
1274789111602147328 2020-06-21 15:39:43 EDT <editweb> Still no help from @comcastcares or @comcast @Xfinity . 5 hours down and counting. Is anyone even working on the issue? Third outage this week.  @CityofAuroraIL
1274780443469021185 2020-06-21 15:05:16 EDT <DeFyKingzz> First game in and xfinity had a internet outage. AWESOME
1274777004357935109 2020-06-21 14:51:36 EDT <MrTonyBones> Damn @Xfinity @comcastcares what‚Äôs with all the outages in my area as of late? Wtf!? üëéüèΩ
1274717141078507523 2020-06-21 10:53:44 EDT <MyVarga0831> @Xfinity xfinity you are the greatest fucking garbage on service providers. Fix your vonstant outages or get out of the business. No wonder why you put an arbitration clause on your contract, otherwise you would be getting a class action lawsuit
1274716300879724544 2020-06-21 10:50:23 EDT <elue_vera> Is there an outage in Chicago? Xfinity programs are not working well or is this how Xfinity is ?  https://twitter.com/plumleymp1/status/1274704226392969217¬†‚Ä¶
1274704226392969217 2020-06-21 10:02:25 EDT <plumleymp1> @Xfinity Internet outage in Downtown Memphis lasting more than 48 hours? What is taking so long? This is the worst service ever with no explanation of the outage except pushing it the resolved time. Can‚Äôt wait to switch to @ATT fiber internet.
1274699898827542533 2020-06-21 09:45:13 EDT <fukherrite> @Xfinity go figure another network outage and no one to answer at the office. @Xfinity sucks can‚Äôt wait to cancel tomorrow and get @googlefiber
1274567593995665408 2020-06-21 00:59:29 EDT <SiSi_Simply> Xfinity Mobile is being considered ü§î.. but I wonder does it have outages like their home internet lol
1274558602049708032 2020-06-21 00:23:45 EDT <santras77> @Xfinity horrible service. Horrible service provider and horrible agents on online chat. Everyday internet service outage in last 3 weeks.
1274556460043833344 2020-06-21 00:15:14 EDT <KnightOfNoise> *technically* made it through a day without an internet outage.  It's 12:13AM. The internet is out.  @Xfinity does not care. This is beyond stupid. I guess I'll just go to bed.
1274550027373944833 2020-06-20 23:49:41 EDT <Capy9llves> 3 outages in one day. Nice one @Xfinity üëç
1274546647876489218 2020-06-20 23:36:15 EDT <AKDesignCo2> @Xfinity another outage in my area. Seriously thinking about dropping the service!
1274540513031589888 2020-06-20 23:11:52 EDT <flippingtable> Hey @Xfinity why has my wifi in an outage for over 8 hours?  Can fix Wi-Fi in midtown Atlanta? ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1274531285147533312 2020-06-20 22:35:12 EDT <codecracker87> @Xfinity complete service outage in my area. App says it "will" be restored by 10:40pm. Y'all got 5 minutes or I want an adjustment to this months bill.
1274528668656820230 2020-06-20 22:24:48 EDT <SunniVibez> Girl yes lol Xfinity had an outage yesterday and my tweets had JUST posted lol
1274514975948767233 2020-06-20 21:30:24 EDT <DivineLettieM> Honestly every week now for over a month @Xfinity has an outage (or two!) in my area that knocks everything out for hours at a time. Idk what‚Äôs going on but people pay too money for services to be going in and out like this
1274509842481364995 2020-06-20 21:10:00 EDT <SunniVibez> Another Xfinity outage smh at this point i need some money back
1274507138409234434 2020-06-20 20:59:15 EDT <slfealk> Xfinity internet service outage in Spokane, WA.  Any one else having issues? Was watching POTUS and poof!

1274497927147184128 2020-06-20 20:22:39 EDT <omnific9> My habit of hoarding paper books is paying off amid a five-day @comcast @Xfinity internet outage frenzy!
1274492262689406976 2020-06-20 20:00:09 EDT <cherylme720> Whatever you do stay away from Suddenlink weekly outages that last 4 to 14 hours
1274487716755976192 2020-06-20 19:42:05 EDT <Sooo_SeducTiff> Xfinity wanna have an outage while I‚Äôm trying to do a search for a new career üòí

1274411379080990721 2020-06-20 14:38:44 EDT <jagjindersingh> @Xfinity what‚Äôs up with your multiple outages every day for the past 2 weeks?!
1274382074804416513 2020-06-20 12:42:18 EDT <JonCarroll03> @Xfinity @comcast   This is a Lie!   Update your service outage map!  Just another day of no internet with Xfinity!  pic.twitter.com/TQH9H9SgHP
1274376665498562560 2020-06-20 12:20:48 EDT <_kib616> im so tired of Xfinity and these outages üôÑ
1274365005299953669 2020-06-20 11:34:28 EDT <dmcvols> Yo @comcast @Xfinity why don‚Äôt you let ur customers know when there is going to be a service outage. #GetItTogether by riders up time please!
1274358009259593728 2020-06-20 11:06:40 EDT <aray_1869> - there is a problem with the internet in my neighborhood   @Xfinity - we are not showing any outages  Typical
1274204622081515521 2020-06-20 00:57:10 EDT <chubbiebunz> SO uh.....there‚Äôs an Xfinity outage in my area.......and they say they‚Äôll probably get it back up around 1am PST. And I ain‚Äôt having it......  Let‚Äôs hope it only last for an hour and it‚Äôll come back up so I can stream and collab with @prince_justin ü•∫  I‚Äôll keep y‚Äôall updated!

1274187532180361221 2020-06-19 23:49:15 EDT <LxrdTrippy> @Xfinity outage?
1274146703227129862 2020-06-19 21:07:01 EDT <PhillyDiehard08> @comcast @Xfinity Your an absolute joke of a company interview has been going off and on for the last week ur outage map is also a peice of shit it says my house is not suffering from the outage in my town but apparently it is  pic.twitter.com/dzgLqWicBL

1274117778652479490 2020-06-19 19:12:05 EDT <mattj2391> @Xfinity TV has been out for over 6 hours. Refreshed and still no luck, but you‚Äôre still saying there are no outages. What do I do?
1274090880434143232 2020-06-19 17:25:12 EDT <JordanQuinn7> Hi @xfinity ‚Äî How long should it take until I see a credit for the 18 hour internet outage we just had...again?
1274083543841484807 2020-06-19 16:56:02 EDT <frpeterpreble> Your very up to date map shows no outage in my area. Guess its just sucky service.
1274071519967145985 2020-06-19 16:08:16 EDT <joeysahagun> Hey @Xfinity. Seriously, enough with the internet outages in Visalia. That's twice in the last 2 weeks. People are working from home and need internet service. This ü§è close to canceling your service and going with someone else. You're costing us money when we can't work!
1274060799045177346 2020-06-19 15:25:40 EDT <ClarkFoster8> @comcastcares @Xfinity - two days of back to back slow service and outages in Chicago area. I registered for text alerts but no communication. Worst customer experience!
1274054306489122817 2020-06-19 14:59:52 EDT <MickHinrichs> @comcastcares @comcast @Xfinity Hello Comcast. My neighborhood has had an internet outage for the last 6 hours. Over 30 of my neighbors and I have attempted to call, but we have been told that there is no service outage and need to schedule a service tech. Please help!
1274047528305033223 2020-06-19 14:32:56 EDT <JordanQuinn7> Your app isn‚Äôt even working correctly right now to provide updates. Atleast Google Fiber refunded for the rare outages they have. You just bend us over and tell us to suck it up.
1274046228901367810 2020-06-19 14:27:46 EDT <JordanQuinn7> Internet outage as usual in the area since last night. Not the best time when literally everybody is working from home.
1274046189655261184 2020-06-19 14:27:36 EDT <lachelle_shayla> Swear Xfinity have a outage at least 2-3 times a week ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1274040656671932423 2020-06-19 14:05:37 EDT <Xfinity> Hi there. The Xfinity My Account app will provide you any information on outages or maintenance in your area. If the app shows neither, try restarting your gateway!
1274037132454252544 2020-06-19 13:51:37 EDT <cyber_guy_josh> Dear @Xfinity,  We‚Äôre coming up on 4 hours. That‚Äôs $20 buck off my bill. A 4hr outage is unacceptable anywhere else.   @comcastcares https://twitter.com/cyber_guy_josh/status/1273976616046256128¬†‚Ä¶
1274034531469799424 2020-06-19 13:41:17 EDT <_CoronelKeniuh> Is @Xfinity  having an outage? Wtf is going on
1274022962103017472 2020-06-19 12:55:19 EDT <pjtx2> @comcastcares @comcast @Xfinity neighborhood system outage all day and no updates from you! Many calls to service result in everyone being asked to schedule with a tech. Each time we call we hear there‚Äôs no systems outage on your side. What‚Äôs the story? Get this fixed ASAP!
1274019817692057611 2020-06-19 12:42:49 EDT <himynameis_jon> @Xfinity Guess what time it is? Internet outage time! Service in this area is horrendous. Sad I wasn't allowed to cancel my contract early. Paying for a sub pat service is terrible. Switching to @ATT and never looking back.
1274018453805031424 2020-06-19 12:37:24 EDT <Iamsynclo> @Xfinity Outage again in my area and I've been dropping internet all week new modem and everything cant live stream or play anything 4 days in a row what gives???
1274007537378082819 2020-06-19 11:54:01 EDT <Chris_Lotp> Definite #outage of @Xfinity in #Houston. I find it interesting other parts of the US are experiencing the same issue. Doesn‚Äôt seem isolated. #netneutrality
1274006176225562624 2020-06-19 11:48:36 EDT <TeancumXG> Well right as I‚Äôm getting ready to power up the stream, @Xfinity has an outageüòí they don‚Äôt even provide good internet to my area in the first place and now this crap happens. Tilting
1273998136822857733 2020-06-19 11:16:40 EDT <montserratwho> I have been working from home since March and I kid you not there‚Äôs a service outage AT LEAST once a week.. @Xfinity y‚Äôall are about to get dropped.. üò§
1273992246141112322 2020-06-19 10:53:15 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Judy. Do you have the Xfinity My Account app? You can check the status of outages, troubleshoot your connection and more. It's a great resource to have.
1273991925058678784 2020-06-19 10:51:59 EDT <adickerson2126> This is not how I pictured my Friday going. Internet won‚Äôt work. @Xfinity claims there is no outage at my house, only in my zip code but, I have restarted my computer twice, shut it down completely once, unplugged it for 10 seconds log back on and it still will not work....
1273984788601417729 2020-06-19 10:23:37 EDT <Xfinity> Hey. There could be an outage affecting the service, but you'd need the account info to check. Try restarting the gateway and see if that helps.
1273981358805745664 2020-06-19 10:10:00 EDT <clarkeanax> I find it incredibly racist And ironic  that Xfinity/Comcast is having an outage on Juneteenth. Talking about it might last until 4? These mfs better figure it out real quick!
1273976616046256128 2020-06-19 09:51:09 EDT <cyber_guy_josh> Dear @xfinity,  For each hour of outage, please deduct $5 from my bill. #remotework is difficult enough already without your consistent ‚Äúunplanned outages.‚Äù
1273976193537183746 2020-06-19 09:49:28 EDT <HoodBall_15> @Xfinity come on guys! This is crazy! There are no outages in my area, and internet service has been off since 5:30 YESTERDAY. You‚Äôre better than this! Please advise.
1273971566573993984 2020-06-19 09:31:05 EDT <ericofallon> @Xfinity Are you able to confirm a outage in zip code 55422? My app says my house is not affected, but my internet went down this morning. Thanks in advance.
1273961862313508869 2020-06-19 08:52:31 EDT <aradaraman> @Xfinity I'm trying to work from home and I'm not sure why there's an outage. Is there any possible way to be quicker than 11:06am?
1273961408506585088 2020-06-19 08:50:43 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked your My Account app to see if there's an outage reported in your area?
1273958995506728962 2020-06-19 08:41:08 EDT <KGras13> @xfinity I was patient for a while but you‚Äôve created an internet outage for 3 days straight in a residential neighborhood when everyone is still working from home. This is absolutely absurd.
1273951198010277889 2020-06-19 08:10:09 EDT <beard_sec> @xfinity Why do I pay you hundreds of dollars a month when I now have been without internet for more than six hours? This is the fourth "unplanned outage" in two weeks and the third of 4+ hours. Tethering with @Verizon is the only way I've been able to get work done tonight.
1273894000726949890 2020-06-19 04:22:52 EDT <NFTW2017> Are they working right now to fix outages?
1273891003007668226 2020-06-19 04:10:57 EDT <fearlessmariah_> @Xfinity this outage has lasted for four days. Please fix it ASAP.

1273858165688287233 2020-06-19 02:00:28 EDT <beard_sec> @xfinity Why do I pay you hundreds of dollars a month if your service has had "unplanned outages" FOUR FUCKING TIMES THIS WEEK?
1273842586038480897 2020-06-19 00:58:34 EDT <BostonRy> Why do @Xfinity outages never seem to happen when I‚Äôm up late binging some show, only when I‚Äôm up late working...  pic.twitter.com/NGCXISxOT1
1273803788831223808 2020-06-18 22:24:24 EDT <Chowder_916> @xfinity when will  these outages stop, it‚Äôs been occurring or 3 days now and last 4-6 hours. Please fix this
1273788129703575552 2020-06-18 21:22:10 EDT <RussSoulo> Xfinity was been randomly having outages for the past week. I‚Äôm sick
1273787468446236672 2020-06-18 21:19:32 EDT <BrookeJPlummer> @Xfinity my internet is not working. Yet there are no outages reported in my area and the diagnostic test on my internet through the xfinity app came back with nothing wrong.
1273780063981514752 2020-06-18 20:50:07 EDT <derfmcgerfin> Hey @Xfinity I just want to say that your service sucks, the outages are absurd, and I hate that I have to do business with you but unfortunately you have a monopoly on cable internet in my area.
1273777913633165312 2020-06-18 20:41:34 EDT <AeroNews> 'have been dealing with abysmal @comcastcares service for several weeks... outages, excuses, outright falsehoods, broken promises, you name it. The company is one of the worst we've ever dealt with. Beware @Comcast, @Xfinity. NOT worth the trouble.  #comcastfail
1273776090834776072 2020-06-18 20:34:20 EDT <blackwelljeff> Now in hour 2 of what has become a multiple-times per week outage of cable and internet @Xfinity . Where are the reliability, service, and performance you promised to get me to switch from @Verizon ? Looks like it is time to switch back!
1273753750788866049 2020-06-18 19:05:34 EDT <Xfinity> We're sorry for the inconvenience the interruption has caused, and our techs are working to get everything restored asap. Please keep checking the My Account app for outage updates.
1273749487916285955 2020-06-18 18:48:37 EDT <damechoripan> @Xfinity 2 4-hour outages in a week? You guys could at least act like you‚Äôre trying.
1273747916641927168 2020-06-18 18:42:23 EDT <ahh_aahhh_AAHHH> @Xfinity Cable and internet have not been working for the last 6 hours. Yes, every cable is connected tightly. And no, there is not a service outage in my area. Thank you for having me miss a whole day working from home for the second time within the last month.
1273745765974839296 2020-06-18 18:33:50 EDT <TheBIGDOOKY> Of course @Xfinity would have an outage right as the EA Showcase starts.   Y‚Äôall never cease to fucking amaze me.
1273737118465118208 2020-06-18 17:59:28 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Andy. You can check for outages in your area through the My Account app or by using this link here:  https://xfin.tv/2zKxBtR¬†.
1273700478774398979 2020-06-18 15:33:53 EDT <MzNikkiT2> @Xfinity is there an outage 60074?
1273698658178007040 2020-06-18 15:26:38 EDT <rgienko> @comcast @Xfinity @comcastcares Well Comcast, 2nd day in a row you‚Äôre having outages for no reason. Can‚Äôt wait to cancel my service.
1273689676528979968 2020-06-18 14:50:57 EDT <gentilejl19> @Xfinity I have experienced internet outages for the past 4 days from 12:45-1:30pm.  Are these planned?
1273682805466243072 2020-06-18 14:23:39 EDT <Xfinity> You can always check the Xfinity My Account app for updates on outages.
1273681283433070592 2020-06-18 14:17:36 EDT <da12thkind> Hey y'all! Just wanted to give a quick update on the website: I just scheduled the last four episodes of Mini-Pack, and also trying to overhaul parts of the website have been really hard because Comcast XFinity is currently having its 4th outage this week.
1273676719719952385 2020-06-18 13:59:28 EDT <RonSwansonite> @Xfinity I am so SICK AND TIRED of my internet being slow, losing connection, lagging, and being out of service. THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A MONTH. ANOTHER outage reported in my area today. FIX YOUR GARBAGE SERVICE!!!
1273676345487302656 2020-06-18 13:57:59 EDT <JudyTrudy> Thank you.  There are no outages in my area, yet my internet speed is slower than usual.
1273673853282258944 2020-06-18 13:48:04 EDT <EmilyLaughren> @Xfinity cut to this week: The "periodic" (half-business day outages) are still ongoing. And the work is still ongoing, as they still have contractors in the neighborhood.
1273673500117606410 2020-06-18 13:46:40 EDT <EmilyLaughren> So my Dad tells me that a few weeks ago, @Xfinity tells him via voicemail that they're doing work in the neighborhood and to expect periodic outages.
1273670393820110848 2020-06-18 13:34:20 EDT <ursosorrindo> There are a lot of area outages for maintenance. Mine went down around 1:30 this morning.   The best tool I've found with Xfinity (it you have them), is the app. It tells out about outages, or devices trying to connect to your WiFi, etc.
1273669902994493440 2020-06-18 13:32:23 EDT <brianwithanm> Consistent outages in the area. It‚Äôs been about 3-4 now in the last 30 days.
1273663909367595009 2020-06-18 13:08:34 EDT <Xfinity> We do apologize for the issues you've been facing. We can help with your bill due to this outage. DM us here:  https://xfin.tv/support¬† üëà
1273663529929842690 2020-06-18 13:07:03 EDT <Xfinity> Why haven't you had service in this time? Has there been an area outage or is there an issue with your equipment?
1273661327677050883 2020-06-18 12:58:18 EDT <TheMissesOliver> @Xfinity Are there any outages? If there are where can I find that info? Thanks!
1273660368242556929 2020-06-18 12:54:29 EDT <toastdriver> @Xfinity are you going to reimburse me for constantly having to use my hotspot instead of having reliable internet connection???  People are working from home and our neighborhood has had a service outage literally every day  pic.twitter.com/rTr672nZZ7
1273657645107380225 2020-06-18 12:43:40 EDT <Xfinity> There can be a number of reasons why we might experience a network event, including weather and local construction. If the outage is reported in your My Account app, keep an eye there for updates.
1273657564698476548 2020-06-18 12:43:21 EDT <christyluvslane> Yes of course there is, when is there not an outage?
1273657269423673345 2020-06-18 12:42:11 EDT <Xfinity> We want to help. Are you in an outage currently?
1273654958559281152 2020-06-18 12:33:00 EDT <Xfinity> Hey. Is there an area outage reported on your My Account app?
1273654840967565313 2020-06-18 12:32:32 EDT <amschinske> Hey @Xfinity there's an outage in my area again! Notice would be nice because I'm working from home and I don't get paid if I don't work!
1273652492522459137 2020-06-18 12:23:12 EDT <Shanmat> @Xfinity Third day of WiFi outages! Service went out in the middle of an important presentation!!! ü§Øü§Øü§ØWhat‚Äôs going on???üò°üò°üò°
1273651821014368257 2020-06-18 12:20:32 EDT <Leuciffer> Can y‚Äôall just do your job & fix the WiFi outages? Thanks
1273650490245623808 2020-06-18 12:15:14 EDT <sheisit> Everybody knows I HATE calling customer service, but I‚Äôll be damned if I don‚Äôt call xfinity every month about these outages. Fake mad just to save $25. ü§£ü§£ You love to see it.
1273650199362224131 2020-06-18 12:14:05 EDT <kaby0ng> @comcastcares @comcast @Xfinity I‚Äôve been having internet connection outages and its getting annoying. 3 agents for 3 days confirmed that there is an outage that was supposed to be resolved yesterday, 4th day now they are saying no outages in my are which clearly shows theres one  pic.twitter.com/BOxgEQwsu7
1273649316993863682 2020-06-18 12:10:35 EDT <Xfinity> Is there an area outage reported on your My Account app?
1273648655971606531 2020-06-18 12:07:57 EDT <sheisit> I‚Äôm on xfinity‚Äôs ass about these WiFi outages. I saved 25 on my bill this cycle by keeping up with the dates I had WiFi issues. I ain‚Äôt playin.
1273647609341714433 2020-06-18 12:03:47 EDT <titonka> Another day, another @Xfinity @comcast outage.
1273644899016028161 2020-06-18 11:53:01 EDT <BoldLutheran> @xfinity we are having an outage in #mapleshade NJ. Any info?
1273639489382973440 2020-06-18 11:31:32 EDT <Steph1Zepeda> @xfinity app says no outage but can‚Äôt connect. Restarted box and still having issues - can you tell me if there is an issue in Tracy Ca?
1273637177403101186 2020-06-18 11:22:20 EDT <katestarrevans> .@Xfinity when can I expect my account to be credited for the unannounced scheduled outages where I'm unable to use the internet service I am paying for? This is the second day in a row, without warning. It's unacceptable.
1273636161693585408 2020-06-18 11:18:18 EDT <MusicCityMedia> I‚Äôm not going to waste my time any longer. Your stupid robot keeps wanting to reset my modem when there‚Äôs an obvious outage. It keeps refusing to let me through to any agent. I‚Äôm done. You all need to provide better service for as much as your company charges.
1273632206565621760 2020-06-18 11:02:35 EDT <Kagozzy> I checked for local outages there are none and I restarted the modem multiple times and i cant even get in touch with customer support cuz my internet is so bad that the window wont load
1273630687384330240 2020-06-18 10:56:33 EDT <katenerickson> I love xfinity outages bc it‚Äôs the best excuse to not work
1273629889720193024 2020-06-18 10:53:23 EDT <MusicCityMedia> I swore I‚Äôd never go back to AT&T for internet but after this week with @Xfinity it‚Äôs looking like a better option. My internet goes down at random times and they claim there is no outage. Yet when I call they say they are doing schedule work to improve performance.
1273629626007420929 2020-06-18 10:52:20 EDT <ntountasakis> @Xfinity Experiencing an outage in my area, this is about the fourth time this has happened during a business day since Feb. I WFH and internet isn‚Äôt a luxury. Don‚Äôt perform maintenance during regular business hours.  pic.twitter.com/z6pJMH852X
1273626398301794305 2020-06-18 10:39:30 EDT <FureszTyler> 7-8 outages just this month (and counting). I'll say it again Xfinity is Dogshit!
1273621662072745984 2020-06-18 10:20:41 EDT <iamsable3000> Constant outages.
1273617797998882817 2020-06-18 10:05:20 EDT <lonestarjake3> 4 multi-hour internet outages in 3 months of living here. Cool to see @Xfinity is just as unreliable as @Suddenlink. pic.twitter.com/iGUggS3fUF
1273603999921397761 2020-06-18 09:10:30 EDT <nolimillie> Uh oh. Outage affecting all @comcast @Xfinity devices in the area up to 2,500 households. Woke up to when my cable box turned off and checked app; maybe restored by 9 a.m. When you #ShelterInPlace this is big. pic.twitter.com/bAe6OnCNoy
1273600017761214464 2020-06-18 08:54:41 EDT <amyblues> @Xfinity Two days in a row of outages in our DC neighborhood. What is going on, Xfinity?
1273599518777446400 2020-06-18 08:52:42 EDT <Say_Koo> Another @Xfinity outage... Probably the 4th in the last two weeks.
1273597071338156034 2020-06-18 08:42:58 EDT <rdk_70> @Xfinity @comcast Do you think you can get your system working right in Illinois?? It‚Äôs been a week now of outages and connection problems. WE ARE WORKING FROM HOME! We need a provider who works!
1273590399794327552 2020-06-18 08:16:28 EDT <crsofr> It‚Äôs a day that ends with ‚Äúy‚Äù, so @Xfinity is having an internet outage.
1273570800659058689 2020-06-18 06:58:35 EDT <RuttMaximus> Had an outage yesterday in area took until 1pm to get fixed now i wake up to another one üòí
1273531667655692288 2020-06-18 04:23:05 EDT <CMpaugh> Dear @comcast @Xfinity it‚Äôs not scheduled maintenance as you call it unless you release a schedule to the public, otherwise it‚Äôs an outage. Internet down from 1AM-5AM for 98686 zip code.
1273496280128512000 2020-06-18 02:02:28 EDT <saaylilnaya> so xfinity gotta outage rn and they sayin it won‚Äôt be resolved til 5:30üòíüò≠
1273495376016715776 2020-06-18 01:58:52 EDT <Kai8163> Great to pay 90 buck per month to have a shitty network that having outage every fucking 2 hours. Especially while working from home.
1273488164770938881 2020-06-18 01:30:13 EDT <Sir_Ordinary> *loses internet connection*  @Xfinity app: There are no outages in your area.   Me:  pic.twitter.com/6egw0Djqcd
1273470292195594241 2020-06-18 00:19:12 EDT <rahuldaware19> Internet outage from 8 hours now.l in San Jose. Comcast extends expected time by 4 hours without proper answers. @Xfinity @comcast @comcastcares
1273458533405732866 2020-06-17 23:32:28 EDT <Z6Ric> This is the 3rd @Xfinity outage this week. Y‚Äôall are really interrupting my workflow.
1273436779882983431 2020-06-17 22:06:02 EDT <chard_un> @Xfinity is their an outage?
1273424717823635456 2020-06-17 21:18:06 EDT <gucciburrito1> @xfinity totally acceptable. And anyone who thinks they‚Äôll do anything for you because of this, it‚Äôs not happening. There‚Äôs almost definitely some tiny contract clause that says ‚ÄúOutage? Tough shit, things happen.‚Äù It‚Äôs gotta suck to read these knowing the only answer is: wait.  pic.twitter.com/PGG4sQc93c
1273421443339030530 2020-06-17 21:05:05 EDT <Jflexo_> It says the outage map is currently unavailable
1273408463285161987 2020-06-17 20:13:31 EDT <msmarie9813> Is there an outage here in our area? Internet is not been working since noon!!! @Xfinity
1273404794045190144 2020-06-17 19:58:56 EDT <maria40611576> MAJOR OUTAGE with xfinity AND of course President Trump with be exclusive on Hannity at 9 ET tonight. #Hannity #realDonaldTrump #DeepStateExposed #FakeNews
1273403191812653056 2020-06-17 19:52:34 EDT <LaBirria3count> @Xfinity what's happening? 2 days with an outage? Servive goes up for 10 minutes and back down?  Not too mention my tower says "not connected" but everything is plugged in.  Now on hold for 3 hours?  Maaaaaaaaaaaan
1273402342994513923 2020-06-17 19:49:11 EDT <rschaef9> Yes, apparently between 51-500 customers reporting outages in my town.  pic.twitter.com/AkjXrRX6AG
1273398688992370688 2020-06-17 19:34:40 EDT <maria40611576> Anything going on with the xfinity outage across the country?
1273386586919575553 2020-06-17 18:46:35 EDT <VillanuevaMimi> Yes there‚Äôs a confirmed outage in my area...and it happens way more often than it should. This is hella inconvenient considering many of your customers are WFH until further notice. We need reliable connection‚ÄºÔ∏è üó£üó£
1273376719769088008 2020-06-17 18:07:22 EDT <AmaranteVero> @Xfinity please DM me there‚Äôs an outage until 9pm EST. I have to work from home and there‚Äôs no one to contact

1273374422624350209 2020-06-17 17:58:15 EDT <VillanuevaMimi> What kinda piece of shit internet provider are you @Xfinity??? I‚Äôve literally spent the majority of my work day trying to resolve network connection issues. Why tf y‚Äôall got outages everyday?
1273371530936844289 2020-06-17 17:46:45 EDT <ynkiluvr> yo @Xfinity is there an outage in my area or sumn cause this is insanely ridiculous  pic.twitter.com/ttKgQ5hBww
1273366429467901954 2020-06-17 17:26:29 EDT <blackboltmagic> The way this thunder is clapping, I know @Xfinity is going to have a network outage any minute üôÑ
1273365007221301251 2020-06-17 17:20:50 EDT <e28bflame> Get your act together @Xfinity! Outages everyday for hours at a time?!? But yet we are expected to pay a fortune for service.... #frustrated #xfinityoutage #maybetimetoswitch
1273351851136749581 2020-06-17 16:28:33 EDT <Odecca_> Fucking hell Xfinity can‚Äôt seem to get their shit together. First it‚Äôs an outage, then it‚Äôs supposedly my router... Ffs.
1273348732768129024 2020-06-17 16:16:10 EDT <Xfinity> We know how important it is to have reliable service, and we're sorry for the inconvenience this has caused. Be sure to monitor the Xfinity My Account app for updates on the area outage.
1273348019212054528 2020-06-17 16:13:20 EDT <jbhardman> @Xfinity thanks for the complete internet and tv outage. I guess work is over for the day.
1273341555655376896 2020-06-17 15:47:39 EDT <bambamyi> @Xfinity When will you fix outage since 5am in Issaquah area???
1273341295038042112 2020-06-17 15:46:36 EDT <czmediapodcast> @Xfinity, hurry up and restore service in Seattle‚Äôs Mt Baker neighborhood!  Why did you plan a long outage during the day, people are working from home during the day. @comcastcares
1273341051378585600 2020-06-17 15:45:38 EDT <SarahSchultz94> Had them 2 times ago (currently with ATT, last apartment had google fiber) and had outages for hours at a time multiple times a month. I feel your pain girlfran
1273335329647443972 2020-06-17 15:22:54 EDT <C_moneyPlays> @Xfinity needs a drastic change in how their customer support works. My internet has been out for the past 5 hours. Instead of having an outage map like a normal company, they require you to use your login information to see if there‚Äôs an outage. Problem is, the account is under
1273332215997280256 2020-06-17 15:10:32 EDT <yassqweenslayyy> Yes it says no issues. üôÑ  Is there an outage affecting download speed in the PDX area?  pic.twitter.com/dKAmYtqA0P
1273331886400712704 2020-06-17 15:09:13 EDT <KGras13> @Xfinity Internet has been out in my area since 8am and the outage alert keeping changing every hour with a new ETA of service restoration. Terrible customer service when everyone is still WFH and desperately needs internet.
1273329184329338881 2020-06-17 14:58:29 EDT <Xfinity> Hi. Have you checked your My Account app to see if there's an area outage reported?
1273325997128065024 2020-06-17 14:45:49 EDT <thottibox> so it‚Äôs not just my phone... it‚Äôs really just xfinity wifi tripping?? we got an outage??
1273318076805722113 2020-06-17 14:14:21 EDT <rgienko> @comcast @comcastcares @Xfinity Why are you ‚Äúenhancing‚Äù your network and causing outages in the middle of the day?  A lot of us are working from home.
1273317489569562624 2020-06-17 14:12:01 EDT <apieceofquiche> Really @Xfinity? This is the third outage in a month! This is absurd.
1273316101980672001 2020-06-17 14:06:30 EDT <ceIestjjk> there‚Äôs an xfinity outage in my area so we won‚Äôt have wifi for at least another 3 hours üòê
1273310211546189830 2020-06-17 13:43:06 EDT <Xfinity> Hey. Does your My Account app indicate in outage reported in your area?
1273310007707217921 2020-06-17 13:42:17 EDT <Xfinity> You can keep updated and track the outage through the Xfinity My Account app.

1273309232100790274 2020-06-17 13:39:12 EDT <MannyPerezYT> 2/2 randomly turns off for brief periods of time. I‚Äôve seen other tweets of people saying they‚Äôre having outages, although I‚Äôm not sure that is why I‚Äôm having my issues.
1273308175442337795 2020-06-17 13:35:00 EDT <EmKayDubs> @Xfinity outage in 60016.
1273304009311506432 2020-06-17 13:18:27 EDT <PoorMansTiger> @Xfinity are you guys going to fix this outage!? It‚Äôs been 3 hours already
1273302531142234114 2020-06-17 13:12:34 EDT <kkramer03> Anyone else having issues with #xfinity dropping at least once a day?   @Xfinity can you guys confirm a system outage about five minutes ago? Though it‚Äôs resolved, it‚Äôs happened in the last three days where I needed to reboot modem. Thanks.
1273298846647373824 2020-06-17 12:57:56 EDT <sfgogi> @comcast @Xfinity has been out for 12 hours now. I'm trying to get my work day started. This is the 3rd time we've had an extended outage in a week. @comcastcares
1273298408095117312 2020-06-17 12:56:11 EDT <agoltz> No. @Xfinity says no outages, but my entire building is out. Why do you lie to customers?
1273297831323975680 2020-06-17 12:53:54 EDT <Xfinity> You can check your My Account app for info and updates on any possible outages that are affecting your service.
1273296798946377730 2020-06-17 12:49:48 EDT <Xfinity> Is there an area outage reported on your My Account app?
1273296764003659780 2020-06-17 12:49:39 EDT <JasonMaska> Third day in a row of outages from @comcast and regular assurance from their customer service that it‚Äôll be fixed ‚Äî like a broken record. Get your act together. @Xfinity
1273286855493136385 2020-06-17 12:10:17 EDT <stolemysoul79> was no reported outage
1273286314310479877 2020-06-17 12:08:08 EDT <Xfinity> Hi, are you seeing any information in your My Account app that's indicating any outages in your area?
1273284748912230401 2020-06-17 12:01:55 EDT <Xfinity> We know this is frustrating, we're working to fix this ASAP. Are you seeing any time of completion information in your My Account app for these outages?

1273256064847314944 2020-06-17 10:07:56 EDT <SCWBobbieDahl> #ooc How I feel with @Xfinity internet right now. Or should I say LACK OF INTERNET! Daily outages because of ‚Äúmaintenance‚Äù and customer service is useless. Thanks for stealing my money. Will be looking for something else.  pic.twitter.com/e1kKQhHMVB
1273254799899873283 2020-06-17 10:02:54 EDT <hydendooven> @Xfinity your service has been TERRIBLE the past few weeks. Numerous outages for hours at a time. Calling the customer service line is a joke too...the automated system hung up on me after asking for a representative üò° #veryunhappycustomer #badcustomerservice
1273249464854163459 2020-06-17 09:41:42 EDT <Johthol> @Xfinity I need to work and my $100/month Internet isn‚Äôt working. Your map says no outage but I disagree. Is there an outage in 60622?
1273231820180594689 2020-06-17 08:31:36 EDT <Xfinity> Hi. Does your My Account app indicate that you've been in an area outage this whole time?
1273228623709974529 2020-06-17 08:18:53 EDT <Xfinity> Hi there! You can check for outages in your area through the Xfinity My Account app.
1273182384712794120 2020-06-17 05:15:09 EDT <8bit_interface> Another outage lol. Xfinity is a great ISP
1273173136515702784 2020-06-17 04:38:24 EDT <emivipers> @Xfinity yo WHY is my internet ALWAYS down when I have to work from home? What's with all these outages?? I'm fed up with you.
1273137153539813377 2020-06-17 02:15:25 EDT <lindafo7493> @Xfinity/@Comcast  Again with the *outages* ..second night in a row having problems with cable, internet and phones. It's ridiculous.
1273122296379707400 2020-06-17 01:16:23 EDT <celia_bressler> Y‚Äôall I swear @Xfinity Wi-Fi is the worst. Always SO many outages. I had some podunk internet called Suite Solutions back in KY and it was better than thisüòÇ I‚Äôd 100% change services if I had a choice to.
1273122071585927168 2020-06-17 01:15:29 EDT <abbacchioluvr69> xfinity really do be asking for my whole social security number when i just wanna know if there's an outage huh ?
1273121278250094599 2020-06-17 01:12:20 EDT <N_B_Z> @Xfinity @comcast is there internet outage in/around Morgantown area? Restarted boxes and everything. Says I‚Äôm connected but there are issues and nothing will load on ANY device
1273113344560545792 2020-06-17 00:40:49 EDT <itsMissMORGAN> @Xfinity I fully expect a credit after dealing with outages and ‚Äúplanned maintenance‚Äù for two days straight with zero prior notice. Some of us actually have work to do.
1273112208701095939 2020-06-17 00:36:18 EDT <itsMissMORGAN> You guys, too? Second night in a row in ATL. Outage + maintenance expected until 4:21 am . No notice or anything.
1273111766826995712 2020-06-17 00:34:33 EDT <itsMissMORGAN> It‚Äôs always great when @Xfinity has an unannounced outage and ‚Äúscheduled maintenance‚Äù that completely disrupts your service. The worst provider ever.
1273111612052963334 2020-06-17 00:33:56 EDT <CesarQuintero> This is the 4th full-on outage this week and its only Tuesday. Not just my neighborhood, its happening across town. Get your shit together @comcast @comcastcares @Xfinity  pic.twitter.com/werf9LRtMz
1273110096680230914 2020-06-17 00:27:54 EDT <BeeVarg> Exactly at 12:04.. Second night of outages for you too?
1273107527140626432 2020-06-17 00:17:42 EDT <ghod> Is it just me or have @Xfinity outages been happening every couple of days this month  pic.twitter.com/Y4PlTt0G6y
1273060608674607106 2020-06-16 21:11:16 EDT <Xfinity> We recommend continuing to check the app for potential updates during the duration of the outage.
1273051517365424128 2020-06-16 20:35:08 EDT <Xfinity> That's great news! Continue to check the My Account app for outage updates and alerts.
1273050194955784193 2020-06-16 20:29:53 EDT <WinnieO3O> Yes, I did. It said there are service outages reported in my zip code. I just want to know how long can I use my wifi.
1273048454873452545 2020-06-16 20:22:58 EDT <Johanna92385> I never realized how much I rely on internet... our @Xfinity has been down since 2:30 causing me to lose 2.5 hours of work.. with no communication as to why... just an outage.. should be back by 7.. (it‚Äôs 7:22). I pray it‚Äôs working in the morning because I can‚Äôt NOT work. üòê
1273043093395128320 2020-06-16 20:01:40 EDT <WinnieO3O> @Xfinity How long can u guys fix the outage???? I have this situation almost two days. It is so annoyed and fuck my life.
1273035435065966594 2020-06-16 19:31:14 EDT <BerniespJr> By the way it is a sad note that  have a $400 C7800 Nighthak that is so dead I‚Äôm using XFINITY HotSpot to communicate with you. No Outages or lags
1273032983105150977 2020-06-16 19:21:29 EDT <cwheeler007> Just a month and a half as an Xfinity customer.  Two full outages and now so slow it‚Äôs unusable.  How long do I have to wait on hold to speak to someone?@comcastcares @comcast @Xfinity  pic.twitter.com/u3KGOkdYT6
1273029902225281024 2020-06-16 19:09:15 EDT <Lpounders12> I‚Äôm sure @Xfinity is still going to want that full payment though even with their outages going on.  I don‚Äôt really feel as if that is fair since I‚Äôm paying you for a service.  You should give back to your customers when your organization makes a mistake.  #bebetter @comcast
1273029395771523078 2020-06-16 19:07:14 EDT <Lpounders12> An @Xfinity has another outage!!!!!

1273018947357605892 2020-06-16 18:25:43 EDT <Xfinity> Hey. Does the My Account app list the area outage?
1273018356141035521 2020-06-16 18:23:22 EDT <cedricemil> @Xfinity why is there another outage in my area?
1273014048280293376 2020-06-16 18:06:15 EDT <lindz_armstrong> @Xfinity 3 wks w/ daily internet outages. (Today's count: 26 times in 53 mins.) 30+ hrs speaking w/ tech support. 2 techs at my house who can see but not diagnose/fix issues. Replacing the modem and router--twice. Still no resolution. When do we get the service we pay for?
1273013948556640256 2020-06-16 18:05:51 EDT <MrMaxican> Finally got a rep and they confirm there is an outage and they need to send someone
1273012163528065025 2020-06-16 17:58:45 EDT <MrMaxican> @Xfinity so there‚Äôs an outage in my zip code but they are telling me my area isn‚Äôt part of it yet everything is down.
1273009974264946695 2020-06-16 17:50:03 EDT <Tragic_gamingtv> Ssooo okay @Xfinity has an outage sooo no stream I guess until this gets fixed? üòí super tragic. I‚Äôll make it up to you all! #twitch
1273003232332308486 2020-06-16 17:23:16 EDT <sedcarson> There is no reported outage.
1273003079160430597 2020-06-16 17:22:39 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Sarah. Do you know if there is an area outage affecting your location?
1273002578335465472 2020-06-16 17:20:40 EDT <sedcarson> How long do you think is too long to work with @xfinity customer service for an internet outage? I'm at 2 hours and 40 minutes today, and I'm still on hold for the 4th person to <potentially> help me. #xfinity
1273000095345192960 2020-06-16 17:10:48 EDT <OMGitsGM0> Can I get some assistance please? I‚Äôve checked the app, my bill is in good standing, and am aware there‚Äôs an outage. I just want a ETA that‚Äôs all. Help?!
1273000021349236740 2020-06-16 17:10:30 EDT <SCWBobbieDahl> #ooc Dead Xfinity...you seriously suck. I‚Äôve probably worked a total of two hours today because of these damn outages, or maintenance work being done causing the outage. So ridiculous. But...I go back to the office on Monday soo...WIN!
1272996704678219777 2020-06-16 16:57:20 EDT <Xfinity> Be sure to check the My Account app to track your service and find the most recent updates on the status of the outage.
1272993371028697088 2020-06-16 16:44:05 EDT <Xfinity> Be sure to check the My Account app to track your service and find the most recent updates on the status of the outage.
1272991436217163776 2020-06-16 16:36:24 EDT <TrizzySteez> yes, it‚Äôs been saying an outage for days... i have neighbors who are up working fine
1272991069681209356 2020-06-16 16:34:56 EDT <Xfinity> Does the Xfinity My Account app show an outage affecting your area?
1272989231296602112 2020-06-16 16:27:38 EDT <StaceyM78844177> @Xfinity my cable service is HORRIBKE right now!!! Kept freezing then reboot did nothing and now I have a black screen. Outage?? Washington State
1272987028041465858 2020-06-16 16:18:53 EDT <Xfinity> We apologize for this downtime, we understand how important staying connected is. We can help with your bill due to this outage. Send us a DM here:  https://xfin.tv/support¬† üëà
1272986021647581185 2020-06-16 16:14:53 EDT <RhondelleL> THANK YOU @Xfinity for the internet service down in my area! Because I am working from home like many others due to Covid-19; I have to use personal vacation time due to this LONG OUTAGE! I will be calling and requesting a credit for the time I had lost!
1272983976957935619 2020-06-16 16:06:45 EDT <jonathonacrow> Funny, @Xfinity that there's not an outage in my area, given my internet has been out for the last 20 minutes or so.
1272982178587181058 2020-06-16 15:59:36 EDT <victoriachlud> It shows there is no outages in my area. But I do see you guys raised my monthly bill another $3 so that‚Äôs nice. Thanks.
1272978750737649665 2020-06-16 15:45:59 EDT <KathrynBingham> I could call every day regarding the outages and suboptimal connection. Who wants to flush hours of their day away? A quick @Xfinity search demonstrates I'm not alone in my dissatisfaction.
1272971471145570307 2020-06-16 15:17:04 EDT <Xfinity> Hey. Is there an outage reported on your My Account app?
1272955435394502658 2020-06-16 14:13:20 EDT <JEMD59> That is why we keep a land line.  Our house can have a medical emergency every day.  I am not relying on Xfinity for phone service.  Our internet goes out all the freaking time.  We were part of the nationwide sporadic outage that lasted for hours a couple weeks ago.
1272954517177405451 2020-06-16 14:09:41 EDT <sophums> Of course I have an "Outage" notice now.   Why don't I experience these issues after work? Not trying to sound off on "first world problems" but I'm not waking up in the middle of the night when there are no issues to do my job.
1272953721970847744 2020-06-16 14:06:32 EDT <ebs15> @comcast @Xfinity our power is out again without warning or update. I would like to be prorated for the days I‚Äôm unable to work due to this outage. Can you please get back to me?
1272951333507796993 2020-06-16 13:57:02 EDT <OMGitsGM0> Any update? I see there was a service scheduled at 6AM CST, this current outage, but not ETA for a resolution.
1272950311771086849 2020-06-16 13:52:59 EDT <I_amPetty> This outage been going on since yesterday & I'm trying to WORKK!
1272950185195237377 2020-06-16 13:52:29 EDT <co_jo_yo> Just kicking back and taking a break during our daily @Xfinity outage. Nbd. Good thing we only pay for this service.
1272949620692353024 2020-06-16 13:50:14 EDT <sophums> Hey @Xfinity,  Get üëèüèæ it üëèüèæ together üëèüèæ  I'm working. Outages like this are an inconvenience. When your customer service says there aren't any issues but I have trucks on my street, I question why I use you when I don't live in a monopolistic area & there are other providers.
1272939964083437569 2020-06-16 13:11:52 EDT <disgustinglyhot> chile i was so bored bc of the xfinity outage, i just slept all dayüòü
1272936335641370626 2020-06-16 12:57:27 EDT <Suzy_Greene> Xfinity app show no outages in my area. DownDetector shows some issues a few cities south of me.
1272934928699850753 2020-06-16 12:51:51 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Susan. You can check your area for outages by visiting the Xfinity My Account app.
1272934371281063937 2020-06-16 12:49:38 EDT <Suzy_Greene> @Xfinity Is there an internet connection outage is SE Michigan (48044)? I had sporadic connection issues this morning, and now internet connection has been completely down since approx 12:15 EDT. Xfinity app doesn't show any outages and I've restarted the modem.
1272931422278496257 2020-06-16 12:37:55 EDT <OMGitsGM0> @Xfinity There an outage in Chicago? 60630 zip code?

1272921996096163841 2020-06-16 12:00:28 EDT <NausheenPunjani> @Xfinity @comcastcares please, please fix your outage issues! It's been days and reps just keep saying we're sorry we're having outage issues. That's not helpful.
1272920414415618048 2020-06-16 11:54:11 EDT <Mam4music> Ironic that I‚Äôm seeing this ad (using my cell signal) during another Xfinity outage.
1272917504571125764 2020-06-16 11:42:37 EDT <MarkeTreasure> Got to know about outage through this tweet.. didn‚Äôt experienced any outage though. I am on AT&T on my phone and Xfinity at home. May be some area specific issue
1272903231367188482 2020-06-16 10:45:54 EDT <SCWBobbieDahl> #ooc Sooo over Xfinity internet with the daily freaking outages! Paying too much money a month for this to happen every damn day, and them to only credit me $20? Bite me!
1272899412449275904 2020-06-16 10:30:43 EDT <Tatted_Hokage> Yes, bad outages lasting at least an hour
1272898664780963844 2020-06-16 10:27:45 EDT <Xfinity> Are you having area outages during this time?

1272877953047822338 2020-06-16 09:05:27 EDT <Xfinity> We can help. Have you been checking your My Account app for outages when you've noticed these connection issues?
1272877725758492672 2020-06-16 09:04:33 EDT <Xfinity> You can check here too if you don't have the app:  https://comca.st/30NtDvm¬†  Both places will give you updates if you're in an outage.

1272873438550654978 2020-06-16 08:47:31 EDT <LizzieTheGoddes> The app doesn‚Äôt help me when the outage been going on. I have to work and your company is not even working on the issue. Poor service but expect people to pay this high ass bill.
1272871577852444677 2020-06-16 08:40:07 EDT <LizzieTheGoddes> @Verizon outage again! @Xfinity @comcast outage! WTF! I can‚Äôt log in to work nor can I call or text my boss to let him know... What a Tuesday already.
1272869700830212097 2020-06-16 08:32:40 EDT <jras_wickedm1nd> Absolutely @Xfinity outage here in 30041..
1272865146336088065 2020-06-16 08:14:34 EDT <RioVisuals> @Xfinity internet has been down since 5am. I‚Äôm confused, is there an outage?
1272863953417371650 2020-06-16 08:09:49 EDT <SSJIndy> Comcast/Xfinity had a similar huge outage last week or the week before.
1272810381766000640 2020-06-16 04:36:57 EDT <VizBreezy> Omg samee and outage for 2 hour so far
1272777318805704704 2020-06-16 02:25:34 EDT <Viare7> @Xfinity internet went out, no reported outages in my area and support says there‚Äôs no service at my address. Such a shitty company
1272771142504329218 2020-06-16 02:01:01 EDT <_SoAntiSocial__> Really xfinity...really. WiFi just went out in the middle of my show cause of an outage in the area. üòíüôÑüò§ü§¨
1272757147642847233 2020-06-16 01:05:25 EDT <MisterBackfat> @Xfinity So when can I expect my account to be credited for an unannounced scheduled outage in which I cannot use the internet service I am paying for?  Also, do fucking better.  pic.twitter.com/urpmzR9M3J
1272748669360463878 2020-06-16 00:31:43 EDT <LSW2216> @Xfinity Swear to God if you don't fix these constant service outages I'm going to fly over to your headquarters in Philadelphia and pay some homeless people to take steaming dumps in your lobby.
1272741122679418886 2020-06-16 00:01:44 EDT <erodrig85> A credit on next month's statement would be nice #outage @ATT @sprint @Verizon @Xfinity @MetroByTMobile @TMobile @FCC
1272740599842648065 2020-06-15 23:59:40 EDT <tyler_615> It‚Äôs technology. If you want to Investigate a company, PLEASE look into Comcast/Xfinity. We have at least 10 outages a month with them! It‚Äôs ridiculous!
1272734362346217473 2020-06-15 23:34:52 EDT <Travanoid> "An XFINITY Internet outage has been reported in your area. We're working hard to get your service up and running. The issue will be resolved 06/16/2020 12:28 AM (Pacific)."  Really dude? I was having a good stream, too! Feels bad.
1272723782503854081 2020-06-15 22:52:50 EDT <elainea88030> Haha xfinity cell phones didn‚Äôt have a outage lol #XfinityRocks
1272723762228555777 2020-06-15 22:52:45 EDT <bloristo> @Xfinity you guys should automatically credit people‚Äôs accounts for the outages you have instead of having to call and ask for it.
1272719263309213696 2020-06-15 22:34:53 EDT <EssenceOfEbonee> It‚Äôs been a damn Xfinity outage all day since I got home and I‚Äôve been irritated
1272712584597327873 2020-06-15 22:08:20 EDT <Jm4n> My Xfinity is down. Outage in my area.
1272709734962016256 2020-06-15 21:57:01 EDT <Jttothet> Yes it‚Äôs been showing an outage since 5pm
1272708305190871040 2020-06-15 21:51:20 EDT <KelmanJosh> @Xfinity Why do you need to be an account holder to see when outages will be resolved? 2+ hours but have no clue when it will be fixed! Zip code 02127
1272707175819948033 2020-06-15 21:46:51 EDT <two_ocents> 5 hrs of no service and yes, i‚Äôm aware of an ‚Äúoutage in the area‚Äù  but i still need some money off for the inconvenience
1272704437786759168 2020-06-15 21:35:58 EDT <comcast> Do you know if the Xfinity My Account app lists an area outage affecting your location? -Chris
1272702682550153216 2020-06-15 21:28:59 EDT <Grapevine1181> @Xfinity  just got internet, and now there's no signal in modem. Restarted for giggles, even though I know my equipment isn't the problem. I went online to check for outages, & they say no outages in my area. Except the map shows unplanned outages & they don't let you screenshot.
1272701502960869378 2020-06-15 21:24:18 EDT <comcast> Does the Xfinity My Account app show an outage ongoing in your area? -Chris
1272699822294908929 2020-06-15 21:17:37 EDT <ouij> Hey @Xfinity don‚Äôt tell me there are no outages when there are outages, thanks
1272697596214161408 2020-06-15 21:08:47 EDT <giselleecm_> I just paid you guys money and now there has been outage for more than 5 hours!!!! But you guys are quick to charge late fees.
1272696687908306944 2020-06-15 21:05:10 EDT <giselleecm_> It is 9:04pm and my internet and cable are not working. I have yet to receive an updated text message regarding the outage.
1272681020584648704 2020-06-15 20:02:55 EDT <realJonathan916> My service on Xfinity Mobile is working great. No outage for me. Your news story makes no mention of Sacramento metro being included in this outage.
1272680873821863936 2020-06-15 20:02:20 EDT <BarbaraFroilan> @Xfinity my internet for WiFi calling and text messages have been out since 330pm. Your wait time is 2 hours and I have no cellular network service where I live. What is going on with the service? It is showing no outages and no issues with my modem??
1272675340452798470 2020-06-15 19:40:20 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Amber. We're sorry for the inconvenience the interruption has caused and our techs are working to get everything restored asap. Be sure to monitor the app for updates on the local outage.
1272674419740114944 2020-06-15 19:36:41 EDT <RoseBrown_2017> @Xfinity how long is this outage in Pg county Maryland going to last? It‚Äôs been over 2 hours
1272672475588038657 2020-06-15 19:28:57 EDT <mrstray2085> No they don‚Äôt show an outage and the customer service is slow are y‚Äôall affiliated with T-mobile by any chance
1272669014251253763 2020-06-15 19:15:12 EDT <Xfinity> We know how important it is to have active service and we're sorry for the interruption. Does the My Account app show an area outage?
1272660976672944129 2020-06-15 18:43:16 EDT <images_divine> @Xfinity WTH IS GOING ON WITH THE OUTAGE??!! #xfinityDOWN #TMobiledown #xfinity
1272658781097414666 2020-06-15 18:34:32 EDT <WillY27350694> @lookner Comcast/Xfinity just went down in my area (neighbors also said it was down) north of Atlanta. It's back on now, but it was a strange outage.
1272651072742490112 2020-06-15 18:03:55 EDT <giselleecm_> Service outage is interrupting my day off üò≠
1272645644209938432 2020-06-15 17:42:20 EDT <rgold01> @Xfinity in the past week lost either internet or tv 3 times.  You app never showed an outage in my area and had to wait a few hours then The Sevice started again mostly at night time. This is getting very agrivating
1272641276978978817 2020-06-15 17:24:59 EDT <Gordo_guapo> Major service outages across the US for all carriers. Xfinity outage here in my neighborhood, too. I should have called out today.
1272640162015711233 2020-06-15 17:20:33 EDT <ProfCrystalLaw> @Xfinity is THE WORST. We have an outage at least once a week. That's being generous. üò¢
1272631243541266432 2020-06-15 16:45:07 EDT <bombshell1331> The outage happening all over. We're on the east coast on T mobile but our Xfinity land line is down as well in the DMV area. So who knows , just hope it's not the beginning of the apocalypse. Stay safe everyone and just remember those days before cell phoneüòâ  https://twitter.com/FOXLA/status/1272618228095651841¬†‚Ä¶
1272629265591267328 2020-06-15 16:37:15 EDT <nate_l_jackson> They use Verizon towers. So if you have xfinity mobile and your service is working, your area is not affected by the outage.
1272626069917462529 2020-06-15 16:24:33 EDT <robeproductions> Everyone having cell phone outages all over the US   Xfinity Mobile doing just fine üòÇüòÇ
1272624866173181952 2020-06-15 16:19:46 EDT <AmericaFight21> Me seeing a widespread outage with Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint and AT&T, while I have Xfinity.  pic.twitter.com/Ay98s0QvFB
1272624595082842112 2020-06-15 16:18:42 EDT <NoahBrasos> @TMobile what's going on with this outage? I can't make any calls unless I'm on a residents home jumping on @Xfinity wifi, when is this shit getting fixed?
1272622267634257924 2020-06-15 16:09:27 EDT <jdz____> First Xfinity had a widespread of outages all around the U.S. and now TMobile ü§î.. hmm the govt is up to something
1272621707824513025 2020-06-15 16:07:13 EDT <jenrogersco> Same experience... outage in Seattle. Called and said can‚Äôt talk to anyone til reset signal sent, which never occurred. Can‚Äôt talk to anyone and I‚Äôm trying to teach online. So frustrated. This happens every week.
1272619887421202435 2020-06-15 15:59:59 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Hayley. Does the Xfinity My Account app currently show that there is an outage affecting your location?
1272617550623518720 2020-06-15 15:50:42 EDT <TrendeeRocks> I don't have T-Mobile but everybody on my timeline complaining.....I got Xfinity for internet but there's an outage in my area. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1272616845514866690 2020-06-15 15:47:54 EDT <th3_ADR> @Xfinity maybe you should allow other providers to come into Tupelo MS. I‚Äôm tired of have 30+ outages per month and your hardware that‚Äôs continuously refurbished just loses connection whenever it feels like!
1272616549929680899 2020-06-15 15:46:44 EDT <hayleyism> @Xfinity @comcast why is it that I‚Äôve had to call 10x for any help or response for an outage we‚Äôve had the last 5 days?! Your customer service seems like they haven‚Äôt been communicated to properly.
1272615587001372676 2020-06-15 15:42:54 EDT <upenzi> Cell phone outage? Oh wait, I have Xfinity Mobile.  pic.twitter.com/lPYZHIMI4k
1272609763067650048 2020-06-15 15:19:46 EDT <TnaTheTlknTummy> This and xfinity been acting up all day. My outage just got fixed
1272593660199174145 2020-06-15 14:15:46 EDT <xEpicology> There's an outage and people think it's gods fault üòÇ like dam it happens. Xfinity be down almost 4 times a week
1272589086314954752 2020-06-15 13:57:36 EDT <TheOneTrueMort> Massive xfinity outage that is keeping me from logging tnto ark to feed my gigasaurus
1272575470970814465 2020-06-15 13:03:30 EDT <deb_k_alex> Dudsville. We have been given prior notice about a power outage on our block. It helped because I had zoom meetings I had to attend that day so I was able to go in to school to participate. A little bit of notice goes a long way, but inevitably something like this is a mess.
1272570324572307456 2020-06-15 12:43:03 EDT <Professor_Erik> Dear @Xfinity... maybe doing updates to the network that cause midday outages on a Monday when most people depend on it, ESPECIALLY TEACHERS, isn‚Äôt a best practice.  Unacceptable.  Strongly considering other options.
1272569859075969031 2020-06-15 12:41:12 EDT <Code__Monkey> How does one report a CSR that literally CAUSED my outage to @Xfinity? I can only assume from past experience that they'd like to give him a bonus or promotion or something for going above and beyond.
1272559272048672769 2020-06-15 11:59:08 EDT <Xfinity> We want to look into this. Are you seeing any outage information showing in your My Account app?
1272558750000439296 2020-06-15 11:57:03 EDT <Brithebaby> I called Xfinity to figure out what‚Äôs going on with our internet and the automated message said ‚Äúan agent won‚Äôt be able to help you with your outage‚Äù meanwhile they keep saying our problem will be resolved in a few hours. ITS BEEN 5 DAYS @Xfinity BE FASTER
1272556836970024960 2020-06-15 11:49:27 EDT <ShakirahAdianna> @Xfinity my neighborhood has had internet outages 5 times in the last two weeks ‚Äî all resulting in the internet being down for hours. This is ridiculous. People are working from home due to stay at home orders and need to access wifi. What is the problem?!
1272412602279145472 2020-06-15 02:16:19 EDT <pulpetc> You know @Xfinity, I can only tighten these connections so much and restart this modem so much. At some point, might want to check your side for an internet outage. ü§®  pic.twitter.com/jFzlAhHzIJ
1272396252563607552 2020-06-15 01:11:21 EDT <aeast317> So close to Masters on @PlayRuneterra and then that nightly @Xfinity internet outage hits.
1272382560790773760 2020-06-15 00:16:56 EDT <ZabrioArkz> If this is another @Xfinity outage imma riot
1272293332123742208 2020-06-14 18:22:23 EDT <NikkiBebe505> Tried doing homework & Xfinity just so happens to have an outage üôÑ
1272239790633689090 2020-06-14 14:49:37 EDT <KarenCarolina84> Why do I stay with @Xfinity? At least once a month I have an outage or I have to reset a box? #Ihate #Xfinity
1272217271226847235 2020-06-14 13:20:08 EDT <IJU1C3I> @Xfinity Service down again in the DC area. 4th time this week. All day yesterday and now today. First message showed "routine maintenance to optimize network. " Now it's an outage. What is the deal? I can't work or relax with this everyday problem.  pic.twitter.com/Buo3o4G4o7
1272188496736858114 2020-06-14 11:25:48 EDT <JacobABourgeois> for what it‚Äôs worth, last night i had an internet outage. started at about 10 PM CST and didn‚Äôt come back on for at least a couple hours, xfinity.
1272066053925986304 2020-06-14 03:19:15 EDT <danknugs42069> @Xfinity any updates on 60074 outages? It‚Äôs been almost 12 hours. Really would‚Äôve liked to use my internet on a saturday.
1272005103411658759 2020-06-13 23:17:04 EDT <danknugs42069> Outage map went from saying it won‚Äôt be fixed until 10pm to 2am. Trying not to spread COVID and these are peak internet hours.
1272000722905661442 2020-06-13 22:59:39 EDT <ongchinhwee> Ah yes, Xfinity.  When I was in the US for exchange studies years back, my housemates and I had to grapple with internet outages and throttled speeds while trying to get through our psets and projects.  My impression of the US went down a few notches (and more) since then.
1271976368914472965 2020-06-13 21:22:53 EDT <DavidSt47092898> Yes. Xfinity has been having issues with their internet service the past month. I have had outages mostly on the weekends here in Tallahassee, FL.
1271935309538705408 2020-06-13 18:39:43 EDT <sfgogi> Not only is @Xfinity totally down in San Francisco, someone pushed a change to their code base in the middle of an outage. LOL  pic.twitter.com/Aq2hUHBGlU
1271907884981342208 2020-06-13 16:50:45 EDT <hi_im_Poker> Thanks @Xfinity for the 10hr outage today.
1271907386060496896 2020-06-13 16:48:46 EDT <nevaehhh11> Xfinity is having an outage til like 2:30 chill bro
1271894299416965122 2020-06-13 15:56:46 EDT <shootorget_SHOT> The fact that @Xfinity has had an outage in my area several times over the past few days is RIDICULOUS. How can I get any work done when the WiFi THAT I AM PAYING FOR is out. And the resolved time keeps getting pushed back, I want money off of my next bill.
1271879450540609537 2020-06-13 14:57:46 EDT <xcapereason> @Xfinity I‚Äôm glad I get to pay my bill when having to rely on cellular data, but I can‚Äôt check for outages or contact you without my internet, which isn‚Äôt working. ü§¨
1271857685135101953 2020-06-13 13:31:16 EDT <bethytucson> does the same thing. They have told me the problem is on their end and will fix it. That was two weeks ago. Customer service just told me that for my inconvenience they will credit my account for $7.23 for 108 total outages!Grrrrrr üò°üò°.  #Xfinity will be my new internet service
1271806742435946496 2020-06-13 10:08:51 EDT <theaceofspaeder> @Xfinity your service is absolutely miserable. I can count on internet outages at least four or five times a week.
1271748649807011840 2020-06-13 06:18:00 EDT <blendette> xfinity outage, amazing
1271704811919073290 2020-06-13 03:23:48 EDT <GAPeach_Tea> @Xfinity Can I get an update on the outage in the 31313 zip code in GA? It's been out for nearly 8 hours? I work from home and need my services up and working within a  few hours!
1271691107554951171 2020-06-13 02:29:21 EDT <Skippyy> how does @Ask_Spectrum have outages EVERY. SINGLE. WEEK. Can @verizonfios or @CoxComm or @Xfinity or literally anyone please for the love of my sanity kill the monopoly this company has of my area? ü§¨
1271684317085827072 2020-06-13 02:02:22 EDT <iRunzWild> I swear we leaving @Xfinity! This shot is ridiculous. The amount of outages we have or can expect in a day is just unbelievable!!
1271662175866716167 2020-06-13 00:34:23 EDT <troiwarren> Is there like an xfinity outage or some shit lol what‚Äôs going on
1271660171039854592 2020-06-13 00:26:25 EDT <MaryTaReason> @comcastcares I‚Äôm going to cancel my service because I‚Äôm paying money and you‚Äôre not giving any reliable service. Outage after outage! #BadCustomerService #Comcast #Xfinity  pic.twitter.com/PMFLMG3wTa
1271651650072166401 2020-06-12 23:52:34 EDT <jonahisadev> @Xfinity just saying, since I can't report outages on your website: I am getting horrible speeds even after rebooting the modem. Peoria, IL
1271631681192103938 2020-06-12 22:33:13 EDT <FilthyTV_Jony> I got Xfinity with them and it‚Äôs been cutting off for me for good periods of times with no outages in my area for like past weekü•∫üôÑ
1271631208313569280 2020-06-12 22:31:20 EDT <voxkev> I haven't had any outages w/Xfinity which makes me reluctant to switch when I saw so many people complain about Ziply (Google reviews) of that. Now that it's WFH all the time, afraid to risk it. But I'd love GB speed w/no data cap.
1271620970797764612 2020-06-12 21:50:39 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Ryan. If you're still having trouble, check your My Account app to see if you're in an area outage.
1271615422656282624 2020-06-12 21:28:36 EDT <3refall> imma kick xfinity‚Äôs ass if they don‚Äôt fix the outage bc i want my damn internet now not at 1am :))
1271596412556455936 2020-06-12 20:13:04 EDT <HassanLiz> I am over it another internet outage @Xfinity and yes the app does say there is Another outage
1271577155131113473 2020-06-12 18:56:33 EDT <4freedomfights> An update. Lost internet service 36 times today. No outage shown in area, but other customers not close to my location are having the same issue.  Multiple resets and signals sent today. Still, service interruptions
1271577071148548096 2020-06-12 18:56:13 EDT <Xfinity> Hi. Are you in an area outage?
1271556856339664902 2020-06-12 17:35:53 EDT <Xfinity> Your My Account app will have any updates & estimate that's available. You can also use it to sign up for text alerts when the outage is resolved.
1271552018579152896 2020-06-12 17:16:40 EDT <danacathrynnn> Get this outage fixed dammit @Xfinity
1271551579250995204 2020-06-12 17:14:55 EDT <Xfinity> Why? Is there an outage in your area or an issue with your equipment?
1271540166138552320 2020-06-12 16:29:34 EDT <escenkay> @Xfinity whats with the constant outages? ETA's keep being extended. Can't work from home and losing business. Outage all day yesterday and outage this morning. This is unacceptable.
1271532868918018049 2020-06-12 16:00:34 EDT <ha_jpeg> Two WiFi outages in a week, xfinity? Come on guys
1271528026279477249 2020-06-12 15:41:19 EDT <Xfinity> We can take a look into this. Are you seeing any outage information in your My Account app?
1271525067923603458 2020-06-12 15:29:34 EDT <CMiner305> @Xfinity is there an outage or something in zip code 33147?
1271517072057446400 2020-06-12 14:57:48 EDT <bradygaster> oh hai edge://surf/. I discovered a fun little game during a brief @Xfinity outage.
1271513209179123716 2020-06-12 14:42:27 EDT <Xfinity> Hey. You can always get info & updates on outages via your My Account app -- you can also sign up for resolution text alerts.
1271511421537394693 2020-06-12 14:35:21 EDT <Xfinity> Hey Jennifer. Check your My Account app for info & updates on area outages.
1271511354659213312 2020-06-12 14:35:05 EDT <jsutf1n> @Xfinity why don‚Äôt you just say you have no idea when the internet outage will be fixed around @BattleCreekCity instead of just updating the time every 12 hours. It‚Äôs okay, there was a lot of wind damage to the electrical infrastructure.
1271509452634685440 2020-06-12 14:27:31 EDT <Jennyelderkin> @Xfinity are there internet outages in the Billerica, MA area? Been without the internet since 11. My kids can‚Äôt finish their school work and I can‚Äôt do my work.
1271507743267082241 2020-06-12 14:20:44 EDT <glc007> @Xfinity Status update on current 13 hour 20 minute outage in Brentwood, TN.
1271506578890514434 2020-06-12 14:16:06 EDT <nathancpike> Really, @Xfinity? ANOTHER outage? This is like the fourth in a month.
1271502740821364736 2020-06-12 14:00:51 EDT <TallynTweets> The longer outages that happen less frequently but still weekly usually are acknowledged in the app after it‚Äôs been out for 30 minutes.
1271502314608758785 2020-06-12 13:59:09 EDT <TallynTweets> The smaller daily interruptions don‚Äôt have reported outages in the app.   But when you‚Äôre working from home and your tasked with communicating virtually with people, these ‚Äúmild inconveniences‚Äù actually matter.
1271501631872524290 2020-06-12 13:56:27 EDT <TallynTweets> It‚Äôs every day.   It varies in length, but during 8-5, it tends to spazz out, kicking me off intermittently. It happened from 8-8:30 this am, then again for 10 minutes just now.  Usually have 30-60 minute outages after 5 at least once a week.
1271500045578371072 2020-06-12 13:50:08 EDT <namrajoshi> @Xfinity there has been outage in Brentwood TN since 12 hrs. Keep postponing the outage window. Doing an upgrade on work day when ppl are wfh is stupidity
1271499961545433093 2020-06-12 13:49:48 EDT <Xfinity> Can you please explain what you mean by daily outages? Is your gateway disconnecting from the internet, and if so, for how long? Does your My Account app show an area outage when this happens?
1271498937556492290 2020-06-12 13:45:44 EDT <TallynTweets> For the love of all things holy and otherwise, why do I spend $200/mo for internet that constantly has daily outages, @Xfinity ?  Reinstate the gd data caps if your infrastructure can‚Äôt handle everyone Netflixing all day long. This sucks.
1271485673753784325 2020-06-12 12:53:02 EDT <Ryne_Alexander> .@Xfinity having an outage for 12 hours while everyone works from home today is fantastic!! Thank you!
1271483986846650373 2020-06-12 12:46:20 EDT <BitchItsNikkA_> Soooo y‚Äôall just gone NOT notify me about the outage? ü§® @Xfinity
1271481802667044864 2020-06-12 12:37:39 EDT <GIO3969> @Xfinity you make it impossible to report issues and check status of outages. WTF
1271473060160450562 2020-06-12 12:02:55 EDT <FancyNancyx9> Third outage in one week wtf @Xfinity this is unacceptable. People are working from home. At this point my T-Mobile hotspot is more reliable than you ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1271469794747965447 2020-06-12 11:49:56 EDT <nopenotpeter> @comcastcares @Xfinity That image above was literally just today... Here's a screenshot of total time and number of outages for this week.  I can provide a list via email if need be, was too big to screenshot.  pic.twitter.com/6lWCBP401k
1271467385703337984 2020-06-12 11:40:22 EDT <VVickedshotz> @Xfinity So my internet goes out at 10pm Wednesday night. The "app" says "Unplanned Outage". Restoration time at approximately 945 AM next day. That time comes, and they just bump it up 12 hours. How about an actual reason for outage, and a REALISTIC time of restoration.
1271464377967927297 2020-06-12 11:28:25 EDT <cisco6051> @comcastcares Xfinity outages in Arlington VA for three straight days at 11 am?  Why aren‚Äôt maintenances being done after hours to allow uninterrupted working from home?
1271464313354629120 2020-06-12 11:28:09 EDT <Chevy86joy4eva> @comcast @Xfinity  Even though my house isn't highlighted as having outages, there are 2 areas in my zip code with more than 2000.  Why does my account say I am not having internet outages, when I clearly am?  What is going on today?  Even chat support could help.
1271458352867020801 2020-06-12 11:04:28 EDT <CourtDaze> @comcastcares Yo Xfinity, I‚Äôve had your service in three different cities for the past three years and up until this week, I haven‚Äôt had a single issue with my connection. Why am I all of a sudden experiencing frequent service outages in my area this week?
1271450261190356992 2020-06-12 10:32:19 EDT <iamEp1cTV> Well s*** rip stream today. Woke up to internet not working. Turns out it's @Xfinity and a service outage in my area and won't be resolved until 11am. And just as I setup my new pc too...
1271447795862573056 2020-06-12 10:22:31 EDT <nuddmusic> Jk xfinity internet outage üôÑ
1271444271598637056 2020-06-12 10:08:31 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Alex. We're sorry for the inconvenience the interruption has caused, and our techs are working to get everything restored asap. Please keep checking the My Account app for outage updates and alerts.
1271433757724160000 2020-06-12 09:26:44 EDT <inexplicable> @Xfinity everyone in my neighborhood is having internet access issues. Your site says there are not outages. It is impossible to get thru your IVR and talk to an agent. HELP!!!
1271433624311730178 2020-06-12 09:26:12 EDT <SheBeeLifted> WTF @Xfinity it would be nice to be notified when y‚Äôall plan routine outages. Don‚Äôt forget most people are Working From Home. Meaning I NEED my internet on at ALL times. Or at least tell me when it‚Äôs going to be outüôÑüñïüèæüòë
1271431822510108672 2020-06-12 09:19:03 EDT <TedSayland> Hey @Xfinity - in Collinswood NJ (08108) and internet goes on and off the past 2days. And your app doesn‚Äôt allow logging an outage... and can‚Äôt call cause no one picks up live!!  How can my ISP provide quality service and get this fixed????
1271428060802428929 2020-06-12 09:04:06 EDT <Xfinity> We're sorry for the inconvenience the interruption has caused, and our techs are working to get everything restored asap. Please keep checking the My Account app for outage updates and alerts.
1271375406512340999 2020-06-12 05:34:52 EDT <emivipers> Great. ANOTHER @Xfinity outage. No wifi, no phone, no TV. How do ya'll expect people to work from home when the outage is supposed to last the next 12 hours?
1271372576418336769 2020-06-12 05:23:37 EDT <ZhemJZ> @Xfinity why do Cable/Internet outages always seem to follow power outages? We were without power for 35 hours, but had internet with aide of a generator. Shortly after power is restored, now we won't have internet all day.
1271334413964423168 2020-06-12 02:51:59 EDT <PaleGringo> Started having issues with @xfinity, and our Router lost its DHCP address and we couldn't connect any of our home devices to online resources.  I restarted the router to see if that would help, and took my phone out to check the Xfinity site to see if there was a regional outage.  pic.twitter.com/IZ3n7Q2nE9
1271321474368823297 2020-06-12 02:00:34 EDT <JKebechet> @Xfinity Hi, I was just wondering if there is a reason for why there have been constant outages and low internet speeds in my area? Just asking for an explanation is all! Thank you!
1271320689849466880 2020-06-12 01:57:27 EDT <JKebechet> @Xfinity Why are there constant outages in my area? I‚Äôm genuinely concerned. These past few days I have been getting slow internet speeds and outages. I just want some kind of explanation please? Thank you!
1271313869978300418 2020-06-12 01:30:21 EDT <dagreatest_16> Outage in my area too I was Top 10 in a warzone game before it happened
1271307497010323457 2020-06-12 01:05:01 EDT <sunrise_tokyo_> @Xfinity what‚Äôs going on with these outages? i need some answers or an update. leaving a bad taste in my mouth.
1271303191557275650 2020-06-12 00:47:55 EDT <cwalsh1215> @Xfinity these outages are not good. Please provide an update. App is not working!
1271302606963572736 2020-06-12 00:45:35 EDT <psychocreepr> @Xfinity when is the outage going to end
1271284061940486144 2020-06-11 23:31:54 EDT <iAMMM_QUEEN> Xfinity don‚Äôt waste no time letting you know if it‚Äôs a outage nearby
1271282718135865350 2020-06-11 23:26:33 EDT <mdaly34> @Xfinity @comcastcares service outages again!  don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs so hard for this service to be reliable!
1271258074452570114 2020-06-11 21:48:38 EDT <Xfinity> Hey Logan! If you're in an area outage, be sure to keep an eye on your My Account app for updates.
1271256060586790918 2020-06-11 21:40:38 EDT <HavMarley> Why xfinity always having outages ? Or is it just my router ? Either way üöÆ‚ÄºÔ∏è
1271246468372979717 2020-06-11 21:02:31 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Diana! Are you currently in an area outage?
1271243048916258817 2020-06-11 20:48:56 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Jessica. Have you checked your My Account app to see if there's an outage reported in your area?
1271239324856659975 2020-06-11 20:34:08 EDT <jayhawkmommy> We used the app. It tells us there are no outages but we are not connecting. We‚Äôve even rebooted our modem.
1271234317944045569 2020-06-11 20:14:14 EDT <tomkennedy> hey @Xfinity @comcastbusiness Have been offline since 11:30 a.m. today.  Outage still unresolved & can‚Äôt get any explanation of problem from customer service.  Shouldn‚Äôt you be able to explain issue, let alone fix it?
1271229568557346817 2020-06-11 19:55:22 EDT <BaronPlucky> Fifth consecutive day of daily @Xfinity @comcastcares outages in Minneapolis.
1271204660913868803 2020-06-11 18:16:23 EDT <RyanCaradog> Hey @Xfinity I appreciate that, like, you won't let me talk to an agent _at all_ on the customer service because of the outage in my area but also my cable line is dangling precariously from the electric pole and blocking access to my house so like, can I get a tech out here or
1271204126957932551 2020-06-11 18:14:16 EDT <jaytemp_> Crazy how xfinity is having outages everywhere in other statesü§îü§î seem fishy af to me.
1271203494696038402 2020-06-11 18:11:45 EDT <CarringtonKelso> Had Xfinity in the past when I lived in Buford & I felt like the speed promised was never delivered. Plus ‚Äúrandom maintenance outages‚Äù üôÉ  I‚Äôve had At&T fiber for about 10 months now & I‚Äôd happily give them an 8-9 out of 10 score for speed, customer service, benefits, etc.
1271197131165118464 2020-06-11 17:46:28 EDT <ac3881> ‚Å¶@comcastcares‚Å© this is the new norm. I have better service tethering from my cellphone then my Xfinity service. There‚Äôs an outage on my bank account too so maybe the bill shouldn‚Äôt get paid! Oh wait that changes everything huh  pic.twitter.com/eeWNtX00HE
1271196833893711872 2020-06-11 17:45:17 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked your My Account app to see if there is an outage detected in your area?
1271189496269332485 2020-06-11 17:16:08 EDT <Bl4keVaughn> @Xfinity internet just had their second outage in the past week. This time I was working on my Informative Speech when it went out and I lost some of my progress. I already received a free month of internet last time I called. Get y‚Äôall‚Äôs act together before I cancel all together
1271173779113349122 2020-06-11 16:13:40 EDT <jayhawkmommy> For the third time in a week there is a @comcast @Xfinity outage. If i has another choice of internet in my area, I‚Äôd change in a hurry.
1271157275068108800 2020-06-11 15:08:05 EDT <apeders40> @Xfinity outage again in #Waltham. This is ridiculous
1271150466680922119 2020-06-11 14:41:02 EDT <KeSoFaB> Xfinity talking bout outage in the area. Issue should be resolved by 5:42?? Bitch just say y‚Äôall don‚Äôt know when!
1271147727766851584 2020-06-11 14:30:09 EDT <Lisamariemm> Online streaming outage - another disappointment courtesy of @Xfinity @comcast
1271147521197387782 2020-06-11 14:29:20 EDT <MicroHorArcade> Got the internet working again and I feel like a damn champion. The Xfinity dude came to the complex and fixed the "outage" but my shit still wasn't working.  I literally just factory reset my thingie and changed some stuff here and there and voila! Fixed internet. I'm smort.
1271136225886441472 2020-06-11 13:44:27 EDT <shackstella> On the afternoon of the very same day I called Comcast Xfinity to report an outage I started receiving endless texts & phone calls on my cell from scammers & it has not stopped. This is not a coincidence because it‚Äôs never happened to me before.  don‚Äôt give them your cell phone #
1271124816922382339 2020-06-11 12:59:07 EDT <0zymanndias> There‚Äôs an outage for Xfinity WiFi  Me rn:  pic.twitter.com/qzbcn3laiG
1271121833329295363 2020-06-11 12:47:16 EDT <master_curator> Xfinity said the outage should be resolved by 1:30, been out since 9 AM, If I get reprimanded for this, Comcast is going to see me
1271120686568931331 2020-06-11 12:42:42 EDT <ssbm_ToTs> Oh good! @Xfinity let me know the outage in my area should be fixed a half out before my work day is over! Well fuck me....
1271117360959754242 2020-06-11 12:29:29 EDT <irmahayes> Going to exchange modem now. Will keep you posted on the outcome. They claim we‚Äôve had 16 outages in my area. So that‚Äôs my fault? Now they only will credit 2.5 months of piss poor service with $60.45 but you‚Äôll charge me $222 for non performance.  Thanks Marcus!!üò°#xfinity
1271105934551629824 2020-06-11 11:44:05 EDT <Xfinity> Unplanned maintenance/outage means we didn't know this was going to happen either. If the issue has been reported and show on the Xfinity My Account app, our local teams are aware of the issue and is working on getting it repaired as soon as possible.
1271100434468474880 2020-06-11 11:22:14 EDT <astroschoirguy> @Xfinity  You really had to have a service outage the day Season 4 dropped for Call of Duty?  pic.twitter.com/5MlpeKCMGw
1271093278448984065 2020-06-11 10:53:48 EDT <LilHale25> This is the messages I exchanged with @Xfinity TODAY they legit are trying to play off my issue for an outage they apparently had a whole week ago. This is bonkers  pic.twitter.com/lHq3l6kvF8
1271091862267473922 2020-06-11 10:48:10 EDT <nobius> Xfinity outage is not helping my productivity today
1271089159155965953 2020-06-11 10:37:25 EDT <kyaxcheeks> We didn‚Äôt go to bed until almost 4am and I knew waking up for work at 7am would be an issue. Then Xfinity decides it wants to have an internet outage since 5am so guess who is recovering in bed
1271085944918204420 2020-06-11 10:24:39 EDT <litterb0x1> *puts on tinfoil hat* weird how all these outages keep happening every weekend now that protests have started but didnt occur even at the height of stay at home orders. üê∏üê∏üê∏ <-----frogs that have been turned gay, obv
1271062911859994625 2020-06-11 08:53:08 EDT <Gaswinehart> Guy in @Xfinity chat says he doesn't have an exact time but it'll be fixed this morning for sure. Close the chat window and the outage page refreshes/updates with this.  pic.twitter.com/wlTdF30bjy
1271057657638653952 2020-06-11 08:32:15 EDT <sarcasmfriend> But this isnt a problem with my setup it‚Äôs a company issue bc of the weather so I‚Äôll do what I can but can you please fix the outages in Michigan
1271057412460601344 2020-06-11 08:31:16 EDT <sarcasmfriend> I can try all that but what I need is for whatever caused the outage to be fixed no one in the house it‚Äôs tech savvy we can‚Äôt fix it and we‚Äôre not the problem this is a Comcast problem most likely due to the weather I‚Äôll do what I can from my end
1271056785487671298 2020-06-11 08:28:47 EDT <_nomadi_> @Xfinity this is the THIRD time we‚Äôve had an outage in the last week. I work from home, I pay $100/mo for JUST WiFi. I‚Äôm tired of this üò°
1271055813948342273 2020-06-11 08:24:55 EDT <Xfinity> This link:  https://comca.st/3hfqeLH¬† will also allow you to sign-in to your account online to check for any outages.
1271049907751784449 2020-06-11 08:01:27 EDT <Gaswinehart> Honestly @Xfinity this pisses me off more than the outage itself. Every 3 hours they say it "will be fixed at" and then move it back 3 more hours.  pic.twitter.com/c1BeaC9w5z
1271036075419537408 2020-06-11 07:06:29 EDT <M_Cannon313> @Xfinity any update on the outage in the north end of Detroit? Was supposed to be fixed by this morning and now you‚Äôre saying by 6:46 TONIGHT?!
1271007974790742018 2020-06-11 05:14:50 EDT <OG_Willy60> Is there dead ass another xfinity outage?
1270995766979551238 2020-06-11 04:26:19 EDT <KailiaAngel> Xfinity would have an outage when s4 MW is ready to be played. Ugh..
1270993297998114816 2020-06-11 04:16:30 EDT <Sm0rzy> 12 hour service outage @Xfinity. There‚Äôs been at least one outage a week, and at one point there were outages every single day for a week. Only had this service for 2 months and I‚Äôm ready to cancel. Shit better not still be out tomorrow, I have a job interview.
1270989161240170497 2020-06-11 04:00:04 EDT <BarackOBoogie> xfinity and these outages.
1270984322602991616 2020-06-11 03:40:50 EDT <nochhiitwitch> i love when xfinity has an outage when im trying to watch netflix and shit. time to sit in my thoughts for the next 30 minutes
1270978972633964544 2020-06-11 03:19:35 EDT <maxvoltage> Hey @Xfinity, definitely not happy about this outage in Bartlett, il. I want a credit for the outage time. Also, since you can text me when service is restored, why can't you text your customers when there is a planned outage as head of time?? This is a huge inconvenience now
1270970101710413825 2020-06-11 02:44:20 EDT <goldboss12> @Xfinity I have an outage in my area Chicago il

1270929754489851907 2020-06-11 00:04:00 EDT <2headedsqrrl> Yes, it came back around the estimated time. This was the second outage this week.
1270923000846651392 2020-06-10 23:37:10 EDT <iDabz710> No outages in my area, but my internet has shut off, 3 times today! Bruh what are y'all doing @Xfinity

1270875096593432578 2020-06-10 20:26:49 EDT <tpotanos> Thanks. The outage map says only is ‚Äúunplanned outage‚Äù for 80112. The xfinity assistant says there is no outage. So I‚Äôd like more info.

1270847691707297792 2020-06-10 18:37:55 EDT <M_perez949> @Xfinity I expect to be prorated on my account for this month due to all the outages we‚Äôve had.
1270845448874528770 2020-06-10 18:29:00 EDT <Xfinity> Hey Derek. Does your My Account app indicate that you're in an area outage?
1270844909004734465 2020-06-10 18:26:52 EDT <rubyortiiiz_> Xfinity needa stop with these service outages üòë
1270839636047216640 2020-06-10 18:05:54 EDT <MoLaDaT1> Yeah there was an outage for a lot of Xfinity customers in our area, very odd.
1270836531696218116 2020-06-10 17:53:34 EDT <Xfinity> Hey. If you're noticing area outages with frequency, our team can take a look at what's going on. Send us a DM at  https://xfin.tv/support¬† with your info.
1270835006328487937 2020-06-10 17:47:31 EDT <Julie_Vi13> Yes, several times. It works for 2 minutes and then goes out again. It says there is an outage in my area again.
1270833790722719745 2020-06-10 17:42:41 EDT <brianneubert> Anyone else in West Lafayette experiencing @Xfinity WiFi outages every single day?
1270833515865792519 2020-06-10 17:41:35 EDT <Xfinity> Hey Julie. Did you restart your gateway after the outage was resolved?
1270817043529506817 2020-06-10 16:36:08 EDT <remonamichelle> Xfinity stay with a outage!
1270797001911750656 2020-06-10 15:16:30 EDT <WhalePrincesGF> Arizona is cox and Xfinity is not a partner, cable internet isn't via satellite but the app you were communicating through may have crashed, if your DS/US lights go out on the modem then you lose internet, I used to work for cox. Outages are local only not globally.
1270788067217903616 2020-06-10 14:40:59 EDT <MaryanneChisho2> I don't think it is either, especially with a nationwide Xfinity/Comcast outage. What could cause that? It's still lagging and spotty.
1270784646792478720 2020-06-10 14:27:24 EDT <impressthedark> is it day 4 or 5 in a row with outages? @Xfinity discount my bill
1270775691475398657 2020-06-10 13:51:49 EDT <danielleindy> I‚Äôve seen her screenshots of the outage alerts....it‚Äôs for real....
1270774111619485697 2020-06-10 13:45:32 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Sharmin. You've been experiencing multiple area outages?
1270767823476920322 2020-06-10 13:20:33 EDT <STMKent> Working from home is a challenge when I can't rely on my ISP. @Xfinity, what's the deal? Why so many outages this week?
1270764373737381891 2020-06-10 13:06:51 EDT <Xfinity> You can also check for outages using the Xfinity Outage Map located here:  https://comca.st/3dS8Hai¬†.
1270762314334195714 2020-06-10 12:58:40 EDT <tindseylurner> @Xfinity I‚Äôm having to call and have my modem refreshed multiple times a day to get reconnected. Happening for weeks. Your tech yesterday told me there‚Äôs no issue with my modem. That it‚Äôs area outages. I‚Äôm now on hold and the wait time is more than an hour. I can‚Äôt work.  pic.twitter.com/6lVKtcmaes
1270756756558417920 2020-06-10 12:36:34 EDT <poolcathrene> I hate @Xfinity. Always having outages. #Die
1270753232663515136 2020-06-10 12:22:34 EDT <TheMartyKeith> @Xfinity @comcastcares #outage #xfinityoutage now going on 3 days with no internet or cable/tv.  The completion date has moved forward 7 times! pic.twitter.com/q49DnDnEx0
1270750311842488320 2020-06-10 12:10:58 EDT <cletesensei> Second @Xfinity outage in two days ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1270750213356113936 2020-06-10 12:10:34 EDT <tlane207> Thanks, @Xfinity! Always love a good outage! No need to turn it back on! Take your time!!!
1270749746349604865 2020-06-10 12:08:43 EDT <BaronPlucky> Fourth day in a row of daily @Xfinity @comcastcares outages in Minneapolis. Contacted a local fiber ISP and hoping they can work with my apt mgmt to wire the building, so I can then dump Comcast. Shame, they were fine until the riots now it's all gone to shit
1270749563289206784 2020-06-10 12:07:59 EDT <iam_Jasmyne> Xfinity sucks ass. No reason for there to be an outage every single day during the work day
1270742244455309312 2020-06-10 11:38:54 EDT <britlikeswit> I was seeing the storm outside my window and my faltering WiFi but the status app said no outages.   1+1 still equals 2 tho right?
1270731435427663879 2020-06-10 10:55:57 EDT <MaryanneGenX> @Xfinity The WiFi in my area has been experiencing frequent outages for the past week!  People are working from home?  What are you doing about it?  Your services aren‚Äôt cheap. Please do something!
1270723365913759745 2020-06-10 10:23:53 EDT <Slapp95> Xfinity just sent me an email saying there was an outage in my area... so do I just go to bed since I need WiFi to work?
1270722407574065154 2020-06-10 10:20:05 EDT <jess_fuller> Welp, @comcast @Xfinity is getting to be as frustrating as Indiana Michigan Power. Second outage in a week. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Seriously. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1270721894031880200 2020-06-10 10:18:03 EDT <PARISPLONDON> XFINITY been had outage 2 days I WANT OUT! So unprofessional FUCK #XFINITY #COMCAST SUCK A DICK!
1270718354139959302 2020-06-10 10:03:59 EDT <FREEDOM__2020__> I have documented each service interruption for the past 60 days. 29 days with outages.  They credited back $90 bucks half my monthly bill.  Call them and speak with a person in billiing.  Why pay when it's not working. My son had to miss multiple online school sessions
1270708792578248710 2020-06-10 09:25:59 EDT <wu_cinda> @Xfinity a 20 hour outage is not acceptable at all ESPECIALLY when people are working from homes
1270659680541437953 2020-06-10 06:10:50 EDT <sw_dad> Dear @Xfinity, Thanks to your 6 hour "routine maintenance" outage, I am currently using my cell data to shop for other ISPs. You screw your customers far too often for the rates you charge.  pic.twitter.com/V5t3LfrsD3
1270646871502004224 2020-06-10 05:19:56 EDT <SHONONU_> This house is getting rid of @Xfinity . The fact the the internet is down, the cable bill high asf and they got random ass service outages as 5am when I can‚Äôt sleep. So now I‚Äôm just up and annoyed and can‚Äôt sleep
1270631097760657408 2020-06-10 04:17:15 EDT <1panthers> The only outage we have had is when the wire is cut otherwise we love it
1270606394056560647 2020-06-10 02:39:05 EDT <ScribblexNinja> Second night in a row I've been kicked off my broadcast because of random outages @Xfinity I'm trying to work here. This is getting ridiculous.
1270603381812453377 2020-06-10 02:27:07 EDT <jmb413_> lmao it‚Äôs probably not as funny as I think but someone asked xfinity if there was an outage in Minneapolis... like bruh, your whole city burnt down but internet is a-okay ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1270603195325116418 2020-06-10 02:26:23 EDT <okaybye_123> Xfinity is mighty expensive for an ISP that has outages in the middle of the battle at Hogwarts üò≠üò§ #mad #ruinedmovietime
1270597472180674561 2020-06-10 02:03:38 EDT <Mushytaco2016> Xfinity Comcast outage?

1270589344659779590 2020-06-10 01:31:20 EDT <mws1018> @Xfinity so do we have a time frame for these outages  or are we just going to keep reporting no outages?
1270589044532097024 2020-06-10 01:30:09 EDT <tkemmerer14> Tyler: *tries to use internet @Xfinity: kicks Tyler in testicles Tyler: I'll still give you money even though I've had 3 outages in 2 weeks.  Xfinity: kicks Tyler in testicles again
1270588954379763712 2020-06-10 01:29:47 EDT <iKornbread> And once again there is a internet outage in my area hey @Xfinity get it together.
1270571015190360064 2020-06-10 00:18:30 EDT <Alicia_UNM_LOBO> Centurylink had an outage of sorts today too. I had to teach my students from the inside of my car... when my laptop was about to die, I drove home and it finally worked. I‚Äôm so over all of these tech problems.

1270538790197702656 2020-06-09 22:10:27 EDT <DCAM2Live> @comcastcares @Xfinity I need to speak with someone other than a machine... been calling about these outages and services and and have been getting a machine ALL DAY
1270535471282761730 2020-06-09 21:57:16 EDT <ImberVoice> No worries - I‚Äôm curious myself. Any outages?
1270532438981304322 2020-06-09 21:45:13 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Lauren. If you're currently in an area outage, be sure to keep an eye on your My Account app for updates.
1270531778407792640 2020-06-09 21:42:35 EDT <l0v3lylauren_> @Xfinity can you fix your outage issues please and thank you
1270531650238271488 2020-06-09 21:42:05 EDT <Sleptover2> @Xfinity the outage in my area has been occuring since 11am... when is this going to be fixed or should I just begin to looking into other service providers?
1270528666376830976 2020-06-09 21:30:14 EDT <RamenRippers> After an Xfinity outage which resulted in the missing of 7 rounds, captain mITty is game banned for 1 hour.
1270527366922723328 2020-06-09 21:25:04 EDT <_JusLikeLove> This is the 2nd day in a row of @Xfinity outages. How people supposed to work from home (and binge watch netflix ü•¥) if ain‚Äôt no internet??????????
1270523260703313928 2020-06-09 21:08:45 EDT <Xfinity> If there is no outage reported in your area, send us a DM at  https://xfin.tv/support¬† and we can look into your service.
1270522741041528833 2020-06-09 21:06:41 EDT <Mitchell_Kip> Don‚Äôt believe. Is there in outage in the Minneapolis area?
1270522577413431296 2020-06-09 21:06:02 EDT <Xfinity> Hey Mitchell. Do you know if there is a service interruption in your area? The Xfinity My Account app will provide outage info.
1270521925882777602 2020-06-09 21:03:26 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked your My Account app to see if there's an outage in your area?
1270514096287383553 2020-06-09 20:32:20 EDT <Xfinity> Does your My Account app indicate an outage in your area?
1270512101933662208 2020-06-09 20:24:24 EDT <golfmaniac452> @Xfinity your internet is awful. We have outages for the last 5 days with a 1 gig connection. I happens every month.
1270494629104742400 2020-06-09 19:14:58 EDT <Peeved_One> .@Xfinity we can't get @KSL5TV Channel 653 to load on our X1 box. Every other channel works. Is there an outage?

1270482155345457153 2020-06-09 18:25:24 EDT <Xfinity> Hi. Are you in an area outage currently?
1270478517420032003 2020-06-09 18:10:57 EDT <Xfinity> We know this is frustrating. Are you seeing any outage information in your My Account app?

1270474041481101315 2020-06-09 17:53:10 EDT <eliiciaaa> Sooo xfinity has an outage & now snaps messing up...nice
1270465323960020998 2020-06-09 17:18:31 EDT <Melissa_H_Chi> #Xfinity I swear you have more internet outages than any other internet providers I have ever had. Outage in Chicago since before 8am. I work from home and spent most of the day working in my apartment‚Äôs laundry room using their internet. Please be fixed before tomorrow morning.
1270463026597158915 2020-06-09 17:09:24 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Ida. Does your My Account app indicate that you're in an area outage?
1270456454160343040 2020-06-09 16:43:17 EDT <BusinessGoose_> There's an outage in my area and I'm just venting üòÇ. I apologize for that.
1270455029095374848 2020-06-09 16:37:37 EDT <MelissaIsArtsy> No outages, no service "issues detected," just straight up NOT WORKING. After one gust of wind and a small rain shower.  I wish I could say I was surprised, but after all, this is still awful @xfinity
1270450508264701952 2020-06-09 16:19:39 EDT <prashantkp> @comcastcares Looks like an outage in Dublin Ca. The upload speed is less that 0.04Mbps through speedtest & Xfinity speedtest doesn‚Äôt even give an upload speed. instead gives an error (latency, etc) can you please confirm when this will get fixed. I already rebooted modem/router
1270438340492316672 2020-06-09 15:31:18 EDT <loboholic> Thank you @Xfinity for yet another outage. Wouldn't be normal not to have at least 2 a week these days.  pic.twitter.com/tcRvNOe5QA
1270417371585556481 2020-06-09 14:07:59 EDT <iamrobcampbell> @Meshalrivera is @xfinity / @comcast telling you that there are no outages and/or the outages aren't affecting you but your problem is your purchased, Xfinity approved router and you need to rent their router to resolve the problem? Just curious if this is a standard response. üòä
1270414951853838338 2020-06-09 13:58:22 EDT <misscamby525> @Xfinity I have been calling for intermittent outages since 5/19.  My service continues to be out, despite a technician being here. He told me that I have to drill a hole in my house to get my service to work properly? This is unacceptable.  We will be switching services.
1270397405821833218 2020-06-09 12:48:39 EDT <jbaust> @Xfinity Yet another unannounced outage caused by your workers doing "maintenance" in my area. "Maintenance", in this case, meaning abruptly shutting off internet service with no prior notice.   Thanks for once again sucking at what you do~!
1270394625870749698 2020-06-09 12:37:36 EDT <Trango79521225> Fix your network!! We‚Äôve suffered multiple outages at 60608 just this month alone, down again today since 8 am. Missed important conference calls and emails. And both your virtual phone support and chat assistant are not working. This is embarrassing.
1270394519746416640 2020-06-09 12:37:10 EDT <CrawfordStuff> . @comcast @Xfinity looking to talk to an agent about frequent internet outages. So far I only have the chat and automated message saying the same unhelpful things and hanging up on me. Is it possible to ever get some help?
1270384771122761730 2020-06-09 11:58:26 EDT <jordenberg1972> Seriously @Xfinity get your shit fixed!!  Another outage in my area!?  I‚Äôm paying way too much for crappy service!!
1270384515052167171 2020-06-09 11:57:25 EDT <khollaway> Hey Xfinity, why do I pay so much for ‚ÄúHigh Speed Internet‚Äù that is always having outages????
1270383244962336768 2020-06-09 11:52:22 EDT <FureszTyler> @Xfinity I've had 3 internet outages in a week and a half....what is going on with your service?
1270382977093074951 2020-06-09 11:51:18 EDT <MamaDeeJack> @Xfinity I would like you all to reimburse me for the cable outage also seeking pain and suffering damages to my psyche
1270362961433907201 2020-06-09 10:31:46 EDT <Patrick1Kennedy> This is fun. Comcast Xfinity outage in Mountain View CA now at almost 7.5 hours. "Routine maintenance" on some outage pages. Text alerts say it is an issue with traffic congestion on a pole.
1270352346124558336 2020-06-09 09:49:35 EDT <angelluv38> #xfinityoutage  again it amazes me how they take a payment then an outage occurs. Xfinity do something about the lost of service please.
1270340185029513216 2020-06-09 09:01:16 EDT <Xfinity> Hi there. Have you been able to check the Xfinity My Account app? Outage information. step by step troubleshooting and account information can be found there.
1270333896966668288 2020-06-09 08:36:17 EDT <DoctorLlamaLord> I've seen them stop at 4 apartments in my neighborhood this morning, but mines been fine, the MyXfinity app even says we have an outage in my area, but mines been fine all morningü§î Xfinity is so bizarre, hope it comes back up soon
1270331222485598209 2020-06-09 08:25:39 EDT <Xfinity> Anytime you're having a service issue, check the Xfinity My Account app. There could be an outage in the area or you may need to restart your gateway. The app will guide you in the right direction.
1270329413717065729 2020-06-09 08:18:28 EDT <Just_Sum_Body> @Xfinity 8 hours outage in NoVA pls fix  Or at least provide an update  Would like to not lose a day of work just because I can't remote login

1270274186536120320 2020-06-09 04:39:01 EDT <MeximeltTV> Only thing that ruined it was an outage by Xfinity! See ya'll tomorrow!!

1270242214472384514 2020-06-09 02:31:58 EDT <laure_lind> Wow, so glad @Xfinity knows how to tell time! It's now 2.5+ hours AFTER their estimated recovery time for our outage in Tooele and still no wifi.   Anyone in Tooele, Ut with a better internet company than xFinity please DM me asap.

1270216697262362624 2020-06-09 00:50:34 EDT <isamjensen> @Xfinity: Why the fuck does my area have an outage every got damn night? Your service is TRASH.
1270203946985029633 2020-06-08 23:59:54 EDT <mr_baseball2003> Xfinity is having outages across America #outagealert
1270183129224011776 2020-06-08 22:37:11 EDT <marblzp> @Xfinity where can I check if there‚Äôs an outage in my area? I cant find it online.
1270165397984010241 2020-06-08 21:26:44 EDT <RichNielsen2> Oh the irony of watching tv through Dish Network and a commercial for @comcast Xfinity comes on. All this at the same time that my Xfinity WiFi network is down for an area outage. Well played Comcast. Well played.
1270158235014660096 2020-06-08 20:58:16 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked your My Account app to see if you're in an area outage?
1270158215045689344 2020-06-08 20:58:11 EDT <iamrobcampbell> Let's title this... There Are No Outages . . Every time I call @xfinity / @comcast for some tech support and they tell me nothing is wrong with my connection or my modem. They then say I need to get a new modem. Huh? Then they find out I have a router and now it's the router‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/m0T3WXU7yE
1270154489312534529 2020-06-08 20:43:23 EDT <Xfinity> What's going on with your internet? Are you in an area outage?
1270150352743079937 2020-06-08 20:26:57 EDT <coryb10487> @comcastcares @comcast @Xfinity area wide Internet outage for the 2nd time in a week. What's going on?
1270149610137366530 2020-06-08 20:23:59 EDT <RyanTSwitzer> Me too or to "check the app for outages!"
1270146634127749124 2020-06-08 20:12:10 EDT <SchedlerSherry> Thx for the update on MLGW.. Praying it lasts.  Xfinity TV out in Bartlett & has been since 4:30. Tried all avenues to resolve & report service outage to no avail. Wonder if there are orhers affected?  üå¨‚òî @ComcastCares
1270142339110129669 2020-06-08 19:55:06 EDT <Matt_Wilcoxson> @Xfinity  my internet and tv service has now been out twice in less than a week for more than a brief intuuption. Not sure what is going on. I‚Äôve never had any issues till last week. Now I‚Äôm told my outage is not gonna be fixed for 4 more hours. Unhappy customer.
1270138681429458946 2020-06-08 19:40:34 EDT <Xfinity> Hi there. Apologies for the interruption. Does your My Account app indicate that you're in an area outage?
1270136780684251142 2020-06-08 19:33:01 EDT <josiecastroo> Yes we have literally tried it all. The app says there‚Äôs no service outages but when we zoom in on the map, it shows unplanned outage for our zip code? This has been happening since last night and caused major delays as we‚Äôre working from home right now
1270135444446089216 2020-06-08 19:27:42 EDT <josiecastroo> Yes, modem looks fine and has all green colors. And my app says no outages in the area  pic.twitter.com/28sSyY46Ot
1270113899094978569 2020-06-08 18:02:05 EDT <t_lotuss> Xfinity gonna have to make my next months bill free, because I haven‚Äôt been able to use my internet at all with these damn outages. Like what am I paying for?
1270076522678947841 2020-06-08 15:33:34 EDT <cpdillonjr> Be careful. When your Internet goes out at home several times a month because of Xfinity‚Äôs outages and you end up using your phone data to work, you will pay for it. Bill jumped $40 this month even though we barely left the house.
1270076512906080256 2020-06-08 15:33:32 EDT <LauraSchieving> Not really. I was calling for our business to see what the outage was (it‚Äôs still out 3.5 hrs later) and to get call forwarding sent to my phone but they weren‚Äôt able to accommodate that due to a modem issue due to the outage.
1270068159077285888 2020-06-08 15:00:20 EDT <iam_Jasmyne> Yes. It may be an are outage which has been happening a lot again. Why is that?
1270065315116994567 2020-06-08 14:49:02 EDT <MLCooper7> @comcastcares @Xfinity another half-dayInternet outage today in ZIP code 19072 for some inexplicable reason?  What‚Äôs going on?
1270063411968253957 2020-06-08 14:41:28 EDT <ForeverIfeeXOXO> Why is xfinity having an outage the moment I decide to sit down and really do some work...
1270060329658130435 2020-06-08 14:29:13 EDT <dollfos> Does anyone know how to actually reach an #Xfinity rep? We are on our second outage in a week. I‚Äôm trying to work. No reason, no explanation, no person to call. #Comcastsucks is the WORST company in the world. They say they are interested in #customerservice, but it‚Äôs bullshit!!
1270054178765840387 2020-06-08 14:04:47 EDT <BourgeoisWells> Xfinity is ALWAYS having WiFi outages Im SICK OF IT
1270052890845999105 2020-06-08 13:59:40 EDT <TheDerrickRush1> My app said outage .
1270052164866539523 2020-06-08 13:56:47 EDT <Xfinity> Hi, is there any info in the My Account app regarding an outage  or are you having connection issues?
1270047635106390016 2020-06-08 13:38:47 EDT <Xfinity> Hi. Continue to check the app throughout the day to track the outage and find updates. If you need anyhting else use this link to contact our support team here on Twitter:  https://xfin.tv/support¬†.
1270043431889334272 2020-06-08 13:22:05 EDT <TheDerrickRush1> A outage !! People work from home now and your company is making it hard To be successful with there job with the cable and Wi-Fi going out on a regular !! Am paying you why cant I get what I paid for ? Or am I ?
1270033860953325572 2020-06-08 12:44:03 EDT <ayeschepp> @Xfinity @comcastcares oh look it‚Äôs our biweekly outage right on schedule  pic.twitter.com/IksX4Tp0hm
1270029035779866626 2020-06-08 12:24:52 EDT <colinags> alright so is there an outage again @Xfinity?
1270025143520280576 2020-06-08 12:09:24 EDT <JoshLT> Xfinity is trash for these random ass outages they‚Äôve been having. I have work to do!!!
1270023945308311558 2020-06-08 12:04:39 EDT <_Lilzayyy> Girl no xfinity have a mf outage every other day
1270013090483122179 2020-06-08 11:21:31 EDT <RobertBlock07> Now that power has been restored after a four day outage, maybe someone will finally remove this temporary band aid put on these poles LAST JUNE. Who's responsibility is it @PECOconnect, @Xfinity, @Verizon? Who wants to cover this neglect - @FOX29philly, @NBCPhiladelphia, @6abc? pic.twitter.com/t9oBd2twuD
1270009930658045952 2020-06-08 11:08:57 EDT <theashleyjanell> @Xfinity how are we getting compensated off the next bill for this outage?
1269987720023048192 2020-06-08 09:40:42 EDT <obsessedjay> @Xfinity has an outage like once a week and unfortunately i depend on wifi an unnecessary amount
1269968372164427778 2020-06-08 08:23:49 EDT <savvywonk> Right, was wondering if you knew the root cause for the outage that day. Almost wonder if Chicago backbone was compromised.
1269923048775450628 2020-06-08 05:23:43 EDT <teracon1> @comcastcares @Xfinity @NBCUniversal IS THERE A MASSIVE OUTAGE IN THE DC, MD, VA (MID-ATLANTIC) AREA? NO ONE SEEMS TO KNOW ANYTHING! #comcastoutage #COMCASTFAIL pic.twitter.com/gZgcmX6098
1269859186785075201 2020-06-08 01:09:57 EDT <ISUFlyboys> We should really get some credit or something on our bill since @Xfinity can't seem to keep their service going in our area. Be better @Xfinity We pay far to much for all of these reoccurring outages!!!!
1269844731766476800 2020-06-08 00:12:31 EDT <dollofchoc> xfinity real aggravating with these outages over here
1269843821468270593 2020-06-08 00:08:54 EDT <teracon1> @comcastcares @Xfinity Are all services (TV, Internet, Phone) out in the DC, MD, VA areas? I am not finding any answers. I s/w CS & they told me that there were "no" outages in my area..
1269833021248634880 2020-06-07 23:25:59 EDT <OylerMisty> No they're NOT. No one is attempting to even assist us with our internet outage!!! Almost 3 days now and nothing. Worst internet provider I've ever had.
1269809856615198724 2020-06-07 21:53:56 EDT <Shep_D_O_double> Why all the outages lately @Xfinity
1269802050747092994 2020-06-07 21:22:55 EDT <M_perez949> C‚Äômon @Xfinity I‚Äôm tired of the outages lately.
1269788188589076482 2020-06-07 20:27:50 EDT <Mike_Yazigi94> There is no outage. My WiFi network changed names and I can‚Äôt even access the network.
1269787866101624834 2020-06-07 20:26:33 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked the Xfinity My Account app? There could be an outage in the area.
1269780276080754695 2020-06-07 19:56:23 EDT <jxbrxl> @Xfinity Is there an outage in the area ...Washington Dc
1269766595657764864 2020-06-07 19:02:02 EDT <lordgorgo> yeah we've called 4 times and apparently service outages are no longer important and have to be scheduled even though everyone is working from home now. we were told we have to wait until Wednesday for someone to come fix the snapped wire that kids are riding over on their bikes
1269753000429584384 2020-06-07 18:08:00 EDT <pixelnerdben> Wow. Internet outage until 9:50 @Xfinity @comcastcares @comcast y‚Äôall really know how to make a customer not want to be a customer anymore üëçüèª
1269750355333656580 2020-06-07 17:57:30 EDT <6Keezyy> I‚Äôve been having ‚Äúoutages‚Äù since March. But why is it that I‚Äôm the only person in my complex affected by these ‚Äúoutages‚Äù. And I want all my money back. I‚Äôm not paying y‚Äôall.
1269749171239686144 2020-06-07 17:52:47 EDT <ARosser14> @Xfinity @comcastcares Fifth or sixth day in a row of the midday outages on all services, not just me either. Beyond ridiculous. What is going on? And how much longer do we have to put up with it? As much as you charge us, expecting the services to work isn't much to ask
1269734256101797890 2020-06-07 16:53:31 EDT <comcast> If you have an issue with your connection again, check the Xfinity My Account app. You can find outage information, ways to troubleshoot and more. -Gabbie
1269697918564327425 2020-06-07 14:29:08 EDT <EYpark_CA> @Xfinity -pls fix the internet outage issue in Vacaville area soon.  üôè.  pic.twitter.com/cyuFgc9WIT
1269688442327269377 2020-06-07 13:51:28 EDT <Xfinity> Hi there. I'd first recommend checking for outages in the area. You can do so through the Xfinity My Account app.
1269685892911976448 2020-06-07 13:41:21 EDT <AnnAleeyMarie> @Ask_Spectrum will you hurry and fix this outage In Kingsport, TN 37660? It‚Äôs been out all day. Your service is stupid. I wish I could get @Xfinity here I had them for several years never had issues. I‚Äôve had your cable for a week and hate it. I feel like I‚Äôm stuck in 1995
1269684023112146944 2020-06-07 13:33:55 EDT <comcast> There is also the Xfinity My Account app to check for outage information. -Gabbie
1269658167417475074 2020-06-07 11:51:10 EDT <HelenTeague5> XFinity has the worst customer service, probably so it will not have to address multiple ‚Äúservice outages.
1269653236694335488 2020-06-07 11:31:35 EDT <TraceyF81116146> @Xfinity  My Internet Has Been Experience Outages In My Area In Memphis,Tn ...The Raliegh Area Off James Rd In The 38128 Zip Code.....
1269643755516239873 2020-06-07 10:53:54 EDT <marachapin> Same! It‚Äôs a dish service or spectrum/xfinity in wmass. My hometown is starting their own fiber through the electric company, which is pretty awesome. But Spectrum is the worst by far... outdated cable, terrible pricing and outages without warning.
1269629946798002176 2020-06-07 09:59:02 EDT <AdamCrowGaming> Why is this you may ask? Well the donkey fucking jack offs at @Xfinity  misdiagnosed my lack of internet as an outage, and after five days of this fuckery, NOW they wanna send a technician. #fuckcomcast #comcastdoesntcare #twitch #twitchtv #twitchstream #twitchstreamer
1269614272620814337 2020-06-07 08:56:45 EDT <PS_SaltyC> @Xfinity so when do you start knocking money off my bill for YOUR outages? This is the 3rd time the time has changed. Internet has been out since 2 yesterday. First it was to be back up at 8:23pm then 3:43am now 11:34am.  pic.twitter.com/Kc65z5kchz
1269550924575281152 2020-06-07 04:45:02 EDT <hood_goddess> Xfinity gave me a $10 credit towards my bill due to someone causing an outage ... whole time I wasn't even home when it happened! so I just got my bill paid for the month. Yahweh is good ain't heüôèüèæüòÇ
1269480101567176704 2020-06-07 00:03:36 EDT <jahzmyn> Some areas had a @Xfinity  power outage!!! üò≠ Many of us can‚Äôt wait to watch you on @HBO once it‚Äôs fixed @YvonneOrji
1269459605681246208 2020-06-06 22:42:10 EDT <ericodeen> @Xfinity I upgraded to gigabit a month ago and all I‚Äôve had is constant outages and horrid download speeds. It‚Äôs ridiculous, I pay you guys way too much for this garbage.
1269453199280308225 2020-06-06 22:16:42 EDT <akrotic> @Xfinity it would be really great if you could fix the outage that has been in my area for two days now :)
1269440470700228608 2020-06-06 21:26:07 EDT <lyne_kae> Xfinity can kiss my butt with this outage! I will watch @YvonneOrji tonight even if I have to watch her on my phone! #itsdrizzlingSoWhy #abouttoRiskItAll
1269397130940166145 2020-06-06 18:33:54 EDT <Mark2Smoove_> Really bout bored as hell now , xfinity would pick the right time to have a outage ....
1269394789407043585 2020-06-06 18:24:36 EDT <charneylicious> Hey @Xfinity not trying to be a Karen, but we have had constant outages here since Wednesday, and now it‚Äôs affecting my work and pay. Can we get some stability please?
1269389439987585027 2020-06-06 18:03:21 EDT <TheGreatKingLou> Man xfinity need to fix this outage
1269374931818754049 2020-06-06 17:05:42 EDT <YepItsMeLuvYa> @Xfinity ........ IS HAVING ISSUES AS PER USUAL. *smh* I have paid over $12,000+ (Literally) to this company alone and the service is terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Here is a pic of the outages as of 5PM EST, today....  pic.twitter.com/a4wQh0mizR
1269365562234114048 2020-06-06 16:28:28 EDT <LinuxWhisperer> @Xfinity @comcastcares This is getting old. What‚Äôs the point in paying $100 per month for ‚Äúgigabit‚Äù with these outages. Where‚Äôs my compensation?  pic.twitter.com/rU3hvFXzt3
1269353411805425665 2020-06-06 15:40:11 EDT <RealEarlDibbles> @comcast @Xfinity thanks for another outage.
1269339524208918530 2020-06-06 14:45:00 EDT <asset25> Impressive! They told one of my neighbors that they had no record of an outage at our location, despite having told me 5 minutes earlier that it was due to a power outage that was out of their control and promising to call back (which they didn‚Äôt). Thanks for the hack!
1269330224023580679 2020-06-06 14:08:03 EDT <joseloyola1686> My #xfinity just went out. It said no issues in my area but the map had red (!) icon saying that my area had an unplanned outage. üò¶üò≠‚òπÔ∏è #xfinityoutage
1269317974416142336 2020-06-06 13:19:22 EDT <jurassic_pete> @onepeloton we experienced an @Xfinity internet outage during today‚Äôs black lives matter ride. We were able to start, but not finish the ride. Will $100 still be donated? üôåüèª
1269315554168504320 2020-06-06 13:09:45 EDT <Nappyboydreadz> On my momma y‚Äôall about to be cancel  @Xfinity  how the hell a outage go from being fixed by 9am to now 3pm  pic.twitter.com/FyubpjVBL9
1269312089740521472 2020-06-06 12:55:59 EDT <SimulationEND> Man I love waking up on Saturdays and there's an Xfinity service outage in the area.
1269301237251481600 2020-06-06 12:12:52 EDT <LoloFem> @Xfinity why are you experiencing outages for the second day in a row
1269289226929127428 2020-06-06 11:25:08 EDT <gonzotgreat23> Congrats to @Xfinity for making it until 11:30 est before the outages started popping up. 4 days in a row now.
1269273922299707393 2020-06-06 10:24:19 EDT <RedTeamUpStream> Xfinity outage in Burlington county NJ. 3rd day without TV & Internet. Comcast Sucks!!!!
1269257273601404929 2020-06-06 09:18:10 EDT <BaldyBanks> Yep.  We wasted at least three hours yesterday on the line with a series of reps tryin to blame our modem when it was an area-wide outage all along.  It came back up for a few hours last night and now it‚Äôs back down this morning.  Ridiculous!
1269253688742359042 2020-06-06 09:03:55 EDT <BaldyBanks> Same.  I probably wouldn‚Äôt  have even noticed their sneaky ass 20% increase on our bill this month if it wasn‚Äôt for the daily network outages this week. Been with them a decade and we‚Äôre canceling them for this shit. #ComcastIsOverParty
1269251431435046913 2020-06-06 08:54:57 EDT <BaldyBanks> Done with @Comcast Xfinity. They trying to jack up our monthly cable/internet charges by almost 20% during a pandemic while no sports on tv and intermittent internet network outages literally every other day. Been with them for too long & this crap is NOT the way. #CancelComcast
1269113385364283393 2020-06-05 23:46:24 EDT <ramkumars> @Xfinity Internet connectivity is very choppy... some outage I suppose @ Folsom, CA... See the speed test results... We need your quick resolution... Thanks  pic.twitter.com/CZonuUZ98b
1269106911980351488 2020-06-05 23:20:41 EDT <AngieinWAState> I got it 'New to me" on June 1st, but the casing of body is scratched up some, a sure sign it's re-used; which is fine so long as it doesn't have tech issues. But in 5 days a number of drop outs for no reason, one I used my cell data to search for outage? Possibly an #iffy unit.
1269103560417054725 2020-06-05 23:07:22 EDT <xTezel> not a power outage, theres an xfinity outage in my areaü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1269067578670034946 2020-06-05 20:44:23 EDT <sankarmukh> @Xfinity looks like center city philadelphia has outage. And I live next to comcast center. Sad. Too bad philly doesn‚Äôt have spectrum. I had it In NYC and it was never down. Fix this ASAP.
1269065301565607944 2020-06-05 20:35:20 EDT <Xfinity> We can take a look. Are you seeing any outage information showing in your My Account app?
1269062681916346368 2020-06-05 20:24:56 EDT <WillRBowen> @Xfinity outage at our house for the fourth time in two weeks.  Nice way to end a work week...
1269050784026693634 2020-06-05 19:37:39 EDT <jcarsinogen> I dont give #xfinity #comcast props well, EVER. I will now though for fixing a mysterious STATE WIDE outage in less than an hour! Thanks guys and gals!
1269031818596139009 2020-06-05 18:22:17 EDT <TJStewart98> @Xfinity so is the message you put on the outage page the exact time or is it sayin I may not have anything for 3 days at the most?
1269021030363926529 2020-06-05 17:39:25 EDT <Tucchainzz> @Xfinity so.....about the over a week long outage........
1269018843462205441 2020-06-05 17:30:44 EDT <jhulud> Hey @comcastcares @Xfinity. Some contractor came by to work on our neighbor‚Äôs cable...claiming an outage...after an actual #Xfinity tech came out to fix ours. A filter was put on due to interference which the contractor took off to ‚Äúfix‚Äù. He left the main junction box all jacked.  pic.twitter.com/JTPtBZk7RE
1269011967429263362 2020-06-05 17:03:24 EDT <Baugh33> @Verizon @VerizonSupport I‚Äôve been on hold for 57 minutes to report a Fios outage. Is this the customer experience we should expect?  If so, I‚Äôm switching to @Xfinity
1269006092316499968 2020-06-05 16:40:04 EDT <aaron_kehn> @Xfinity another outage...3-5 in the last 3 days. Seriously considering another ISP. WTF?
1269005130789249026 2020-06-05 16:36:14 EDT <ExileSucks> Hey, @Xfinity it would be excellent if you could maybe get my internet working. You know since like the whole entire Midwest is having an outage.
1268998146203488263 2020-06-05 16:08:29 EDT <TJStewart98> Another day yet another @Xfinity outage
1268986495152451584 2020-06-05 15:22:11 EDT <hspaulding> @Xfinity Your text notify feature for outages is broken. Left the office this am to WFH. Got home to no internet, and a known outage in 95616. If I had rcvd an outage notif, I would have stayed @ work. Pls fix this! Also fix the unreliable service. 4th extended outage in 5 weeks.
1268962140305731585 2020-06-05 13:45:25 EDT <wantzatc> @Xfinity we are on our third day without internet and it is impacting ability to complete schoolwork in the 18914 #outage
1268961939272675329 2020-06-05 13:44:37 EDT <animanmaster> Nope, the app says the same thing that the Status Center says - "An XFINITY Services outage has been reported in your area. We're working hard to get your service up and running. The issue will be resolved as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience." Exact same for 24+ hrs
1268956183144120321 2020-06-05 13:21:44 EDT <HawaiianChap> It might of been a power outage where it took place, so for me it wasn‚Äôt a power issue it was just lack of service
1268955639142928384 2020-06-05 13:19:35 EDT <Wyatt_Powell> .@Xfinity two outages in one week? Thanks a lot Xfinity. Trying to work from home without internet is impossible. Guess I‚Äôll go borrow my neighbors AT&T WiFi...
1268951074368622596 2020-06-05 13:01:26 EDT <kenziekate1989> does anybody who has comcast/xfinity lose their internet access just now??? when i checked the outage map, it was denying my access. when i checked another website, it was in all of the major protest hotspots??????
1268949559109173248 2020-06-05 12:55:25 EDT <gonzotgreat23> Day 3 of Xfinity internet issues. You know it's bad when their outage map won't even load.
1268949381606187008 2020-06-05 12:54:43 EDT <mavrik64> So what was it? Power outage or broadband outage?
1268946397556023296 2020-06-05 12:42:51 EDT <MPs_Musings> @comcastcares @Xfinity Lil' help! What's the latest timeline for the Media, PA / Upper Providence township outage in Delco? Tough to work from home w no connection! #comcastdown
1268943690220752896 2020-06-05 12:32:06 EDT <young_prof_> Sorted it out. Had to reset on 3 diff levels to get back on from last night‚Äôs outage.  You guys should really consider a network troubleshooter that is more robust. Doing what you guys suggested would have me just endlessly restarting and waiting.
1268939548731547648 2020-06-05 12:15:38 EDT <TIFANCY> Complete internet outage at across Minneapolis.....  Both centruy link and Xfinity.  Using my cellular data.   Also, when zoomed out it showed major cities across the US....just saying.  pic.twitter.com/uH4tmreEuV
1268924883985215488 2020-06-05 11:17:22 EDT <Keith_Bracy> @comcastcares @xfinity customer for >16 years. Just spent 2 hours on the phone being bounced around internet "support" (script readers in the Philipines). This is ridiculous. Every time I change service or report an outage I spend hours on the phone with an infuriating
1268916463034867713 2020-06-05 10:43:54 EDT <jenahfor> @Xfinity I had an outage last night (more then 7 hours) for all services  Will I receive a credit
1268913536270565380 2020-06-05 10:32:16 EDT <TobyPham2> I have the app and it says that there is an outage in my area. How can I see the estimated time it will be back?
1268902781236191232 2020-06-05 09:49:32 EDT <CarolynSmithPR> What makes these outages worst is I can‚Äôt even watch tv bc @Xfinity cable depends on having my internet up.
1268902779189411852 2020-06-05 09:49:32 EDT <CarolynSmithPR> Those @Xfinity commercials really irk me bc I‚Äôve dealt with so many outages since having to work from home. Like today there‚Äôs ‚Äúroutine maintenance‚Äù that should have been done by 9 a.m. but here we are going into 10 a.m. & no sign of WiFi in my home üôÑ
1268895940385165315 2020-06-05 09:22:21 EDT <m1ssmacaroni24> Hey @Xfinity ever want to decide if my apartment complex is actually experiencing an internet outage or my modem has a problem? 36 hours without consistent service is insane without concrete answers
1268885831349125120 2020-06-05 08:42:11 EDT <Lisa_O> Can @comcastcares and @Xfinity pls be more communicative and specific about the outage in Chicago (zip is 60653). Many of us are forced to work remotely now,have no coffee shops to go to today. We need to let our jobs know what to expect. #xfinityoutage #chicago #pandemic
1268880426728329218 2020-06-05 08:20:43 EDT <Xfinity> We're sorry for the inconvenience the interruption has caused, and our techs are working to get everything restored asap. Please keep checking the My Account app for outage updates and alerts.
1268815661783871488 2020-06-05 04:03:21 EDT <young_prof_> This xfinity outage better be anonymous hacking tf out of the federal reserve to deposit us money  Not asking for much...
1268809279219400704 2020-06-05 03:38:00 EDT <gmrichardson_4> Well according to the lady I spoke with I needed a new modem. So I purchased a new one and installed it to find out about a massive outage. Now I have 2 working modems thanks to a very uniformed representative.
1268806794760998913 2020-06-05 03:28:07 EDT <DirtyGoober> @Xfinity @comcast you guys had all day to have a outage or just complete stop working and you decide to do it now??? I‚Äôve been troubleshooting for an hour now..
1268790690114236416 2020-06-05 02:24:08 EDT <ly010400> @Xfinity can you explain to me how I literally switched over to your service for less than 3 weeks and has had more than 10 outages in the past week??
1268789810715455489 2020-06-05 02:20:38 EDT <HusnainTaseer> My app is reporting outage now...  pic.twitter.com/AAjsVbRCMw
1268788179374497792 2020-06-05 02:14:09 EDT <HusnainTaseer> It‚Äôs different this time from previous outages. My router is able to acquire WAN IP but traffic is not routable to internet. Comcast network is messed up somewhere at their edge router.
1268786963768700929 2020-06-05 02:09:19 EDT <HusnainTaseer> @comcastcares @Xfinity It‚Äôs been a third internet outage in a week at Seattle WA 98118, Could you please look into it? The outage impacts our ability to work from home.
1268778647252426754 2020-06-05 01:36:16 EDT <SweesoYT> So Xfinity was down a day ago, I don‚Äôt know if it was any longer than that but I saw tweets of people complaining about the outage and they‚Äôre from a day ago. Did it travel or something because NOW MY WIFI IS OUT... Wtffffff
1268772526412398592 2020-06-05 01:11:57 EDT <BudhiaHimanshu> Generally, a routine maintenance is planned and customers are informed @Xfinity @comcastcares It shouldn‚Äôt happen abruptly in middle of night when some people might be working on important things! Please show some courtesy to inform of such outages ThanksüôÇ #xfinity #comcastdown
1268753816028975105 2020-06-04 23:57:36 EDT <Blainer93> Xfinity outage and of course it effects my house
1268732177765871618 2020-06-04 22:31:37 EDT <fastdeck> @comcast @Xfinity Why is there an outage for all services that‚Äôs supposedly until Monday at 5:14pm?? What caused it and how can you charge the money you do an expect people to accept this? Need to work and need my services! Please explain!
1268731264548429824 2020-06-04 22:28:00 EDT <laurakaytee> No, it says there are no service outages at my residence, I tried running the diagnostics, and restarted the router/modem
1268729556082573313 2020-06-04 22:21:12 EDT <willieholland12> Nah fuck @Xfinity I was 7-0 last night tryna do it on my own and boom fucking service outage
1268728045977964545 2020-06-04 22:15:12 EDT <whiiggz> huge vouch, but i think it has to do with xfinity outages in Illinois
1268726076584235008 2020-06-04 22:07:23 EDT <OfficialQuickGG> @Xfinity please no more outages. Miffed by the four outages in the past week. #dobetter #comcastoutage
1268718299409457154 2020-06-04 21:36:28 EDT <TJStewart98> @Xfinity so is outages gonna be a daily thing now lol
1268709884914282499 2020-06-04 21:03:02 EDT <_cavy_> Exact same situation for me just outside Philly. When I called, their automated reply said they knew there was an outage and it would be fixed "as soon as possible." Pretty aggravating not to even get an estimated downtime or any information on what is causing the issue.
1268705286904262657 2020-06-04 20:44:46 EDT <HaroldDisk> @Xfinity my service has been interrupted for over 24 hours with no estimate on when it's going to be repaired. This outage is impacting over 1500 customers. COMMUNICATE!
1268703684445319168 2020-06-04 20:38:24 EDT <BookishKim> Whelp @xfinity is so out, its outage map is out üò§üò©üò≠ @comcastcares pic.twitter.com/XDVfjdhQmL
1268700785388421120 2020-06-04 20:26:53 EDT <GlamourBitch> @comcastcares @Xfinity It‚Äôs been 2 days. Two adults trying to run business from home and a kid that needs school. No answer to when outage will be fixed. Come on. Over $200 per month for the worst service.
1268698950653169666 2020-06-04 20:19:35 EDT <Xfinity> We know this outage is frustrating, we're working to fix this ASAP. Are you seeing any completion information in your My Account app?
1268698185242832897 2020-06-04 20:16:33 EDT <MiLESFROMWA> Xfinity outages two days in a row get it together or Ima have bill outages and forget to pay my shit
1268696066121035777 2020-06-04 20:08:08 EDT <moonstone_me> @Comcast @xfinity are so unreliable.  2 consecutive days of internet outage! last night, outage was over 10hrs! today, my work was cut off because I lost internet connection! this is unacceptable! I don‚Äôt even get a notification before each outage. I can‚Äôt even talk to an agent!
1268689475674288128 2020-06-04 19:41:56 EDT <SilentEidolon> Xfinity having a whole outage while I‚Äôm watching a K-Drama. Noice
1268688577120124928 2020-06-04 19:38:22 EDT <THATJoshKail> Hi. This outage is nearing 24 hours. Is there any sort of estimate when it will be resolved? The lack of communication has been very frustrating
1268680895457890304 2020-06-04 19:07:51 EDT <TG2422> Hey @Xfinity 2nd day in a row with an outage?  pic.twitter.com/GKBRbKSLJ3

1268651103459184643 2020-06-04 17:09:28 EDT <SayHeyCate> @Xfinity how do I get to talk to a real human? You pathetic service this is my 3rd day of intermittent outages and I'm about to lose my mind
1268646530292035586 2020-06-04 16:51:17 EDT <shivanipateI> @Xfinity @comcast @comcastcares been experiencing internet outages MULTIPLE times a day...this is not want I'm paying for...and your customer service is not helpful
1268645620161576960 2020-06-04 16:47:40 EDT <soulflowerdi> @Xfinity do you have an update on these outages and when they will be repaired? mine went out yesterday around 5pm and it was estimated to be repaired by 9:30pm, 1:30am, 9:30am, and 1:30pm. still without internet. now there‚Äôs no time estimate. just this:  pic.twitter.com/KlXXqOd33X
1268645469032415232 2020-06-04 16:47:04 EDT <closer2fine> So I probably didn‚Äôt have to change my equipment at all since now @Xfinity is admitting there‚Äôs an outage in my area.  pic.twitter.com/71aKMNGZR8
1268639550043295747 2020-06-04 16:23:33 EDT <dtcav> Who is most inefficient @PECO or @Xfinity . More technology and always more outages with no estimates or reasons- sorry out of patience
1268638257782362113 2020-06-04 16:18:25 EDT <Xfinity> We know these outages are frustrating. We can help with your bill due to these outages. Send us a DM here:  https://xfin.tv/support¬† for assistance.
1268629657764716545 2020-06-04 15:44:15 EDT <Smiffsonian> @Xfinity these outages are ridiculous. Will I be assessed a credit for this?
1268628569607098369 2020-06-04 15:39:55 EDT <blue7web> @Xfinity @comcast any update on the endless outage in Montgomery County PA?
1268614018949771264 2020-06-04 14:42:06 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Josh. You can check through the Xfinity My Account app for outage updates.
1268613635045158918 2020-06-04 14:40:34 EDT <THATJoshKail> @Xfinity Is there any ETA when the TV/Internet service outage in West Mt Airy, Philadelphia is going to be resolved? It has been out for close to 15 hours at this point!

1268606659112448001 2020-06-04 14:12:51 EDT <Xfinity> Hi, Jeremy. Are you seeing any outage information showing in your My Account app?
1268602906560933888 2020-06-04 13:57:57 EDT <iamkingjhay> @Xfinity I still need that credit from yesterday‚Äôs outage that has caused me to experience psychological pain and suffering. I ain‚Äôt forgot
1268601527637344256 2020-06-04 13:52:28 EDT <gonzotgreat23> I work from home, so this Xfinity outage is not just annoying, it's costing me money.
1268598202602831884 2020-06-04 13:39:15 EDT <Xfinity> We're sorry for the inconvenience the interruption has caused. Does the My Account app show an outage affecting your location?
1268593504441249793 2020-06-04 13:20:35 EDT <tiffaneshareece> bro I just know @Xfinity is not having another outage.... stop playin with me Smokey
1268588622997065728 2020-06-04 13:01:11 EDT <King_Dizzle22> Pretty sure they actually charge extra for outages. Concidered a benefit
1268586758469570565 2020-06-04 12:53:47 EDT <_adp22> . @Xfinity Another day, another "outage" for over an hour, costing me valuable work hours. Once I catch up on my work, I will be excitedly calling you to cancel my service. Be well!
1268585604549410816 2020-06-04 12:49:11 EDT <Litto_Mermaid> Xfinity internet outage right by me so I have no internet to work. Msg in the app says it won‚Äôt be fixed until 3:44 pm and I clock out at 5. Lmao
1268583646124027904 2020-06-04 12:41:25 EDT <Larryobby11> No outage still no WiFi
1268580084966965250 2020-06-04 12:27:15 EDT <stephenasherman> A truck is the official explanation, but as people much more computer literate than me claim, this account is very fishy (because it doesn't explain non-Comcast outages and weird IP traffic records) and also just happened a week ago.    https://week.com/2020/06/03/comcast-down-throughout-the-area/¬†‚Ä¶
1268576516587257856 2020-06-04 12:13:05 EDT <chelgro> @ATTHelp is there an network outage in zip code 19403 Norristown, PA? My Xfinity WiFi is down but now I can‚Äôt use my cell network data at home.
1268567872604962817 2020-06-04 11:38:44 EDT <duhlayshuh> Anyone experiencing #Xfinity internet outages should contact them (preferably through the Xfinity Account app‚Äôs chat feature) and request your money back for each day of outages.
1268560916850839553 2020-06-04 11:11:05 EDT <EaglesTime> @Xfinity what‚Äôs is going on with the outage? Will my cable and internet be back up soon!? Y‚Äôall gonna make cancel service and get a firestick

1268415159975936001 2020-06-04 01:31:54 EDT <samstefanits17> Causally watching an @Nicks video on my 1 bar of data cuz there just had to be an Xfinity outage during quartine

1268403604219707398 2020-06-04 00:45:59 EDT <poppasb_> @Xfinity @comcast @NBCNews fuck you, fuck you and fuck you. The worst unreliable shit internet in the US. I have more power outages and service maintenance every week than Cuba has power outages in a month and I lived there. Fuck your automated services too. Pieces of shit.
1268403195539107840 2020-06-04 00:44:22 EDT <WhatsUpToonboy> I know someone who has ATT and I have Xfinity and Yes we both had slow downs and she had an outage as well.
1268402627831889921 2020-06-04 00:42:06 EDT <twiiterlesskass> I am so sick of my @Xfinity WiFi never working. And then when it starts to work there is an outage in my area. This makes it impossible to do anything. I need help and I can not be on hold for an hour and a half for another time. Thank you v
1268388448546799616 2020-06-03 23:45:46 EDT <TheDeeNicole> Xfinity is getting on my nerves. There‚Äôs never an issue when you take my payment out of my account. Why is there two outages in one day? üôÑ
1268383258590535680 2020-06-03 23:25:08 EDT <Doug_Meeks> Comcast outage. Wonder what happened?  Oh, it was just a truck that struck the network. Struck the network?! #comcast #xfinity #newscaster #localnews #network #IT #funny #itsfunnythatmakesitok #itsfunny pic.twitter.com/KORwWKbxqX
1268376748787478529 2020-06-03 22:59:16 EDT <wombservice1> @comcastcares @Xfinity @comcast I‚Äôm telling you there‚Äôs an outage. I don‚Äôt care that your system doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúshow it‚Äù you can‚Äôt reach my modem, can you? That‚Äôs because they whole neighborhood has trees down. No I don‚Äôt need a tech visit. I need connecticity
1268374738977599490 2020-06-03 22:51:17 EDT <hashVishal> The Service and Equipment status page was not loading even after multiple retries. It did open once and said services are up but there is a problem with your modem. This was misleading as there was an outage in the area. Hopefully Xfinity can improve on this.1ƒ´
1268373124074045441 2020-06-03 22:44:52 EDT <CreseanG> @Xfinity I Need Y‚Äôall To Fix Whatever The Problem Is That Got Outages Throughout The Midwest. @comcastcares Don‚Äôt Seem To Really Care Keep Pushing Times Back To When It‚Äôs Supposed To Be Fixed. People Got Work To Get Done.
1268367052844261376 2020-06-03 22:20:45 EDT <JonathanLiess> @Xfinity I see you have major outages in a number major areas...I‚Äôm jealous of my neighbors with Fios still able to do their work.  What‚Äôs the issue?
1268366433085468673 2020-06-03 22:18:17 EDT <smaqs3> at&t sucks dick + xfinity had an outage worldwide so i will be fixed  -
1268362041712132101 2020-06-03 22:00:50 EDT <bsbeamer> If @NJGov wants to learn lessons from pandemic power outage, there are issues with utilities. Comcast/Xfinity only lasts 2-3 hours on battery backup before the service cuts off. Verizon Wireless data is barely functional 2 hours after outage.  We missed the tornado warnings.
1268359320292470785 2020-06-03 21:50:01 EDT <blue7web> @comcast @Xfinity service has been out for about a half hour.  App says no outage but all of my neighbors are out too.
1268357885232365568 2020-06-03 21:44:19 EDT <comcast> Hi Alexis. Have you checekd the Xfinity My Account app to see if there was an outage in the area?
1268357715639906310 2020-06-03 21:43:39 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Sahnny. Check the Xfinity My Account app for updated info on outages in the area.
1268357715337916416 2020-06-03 21:43:38 EDT <tasteof_cali> @Xfinity wtf yall customer service is closed  Yall got power outages and shit bt no reps wtf .....
1268357683905781760 2020-06-03 21:43:31 EDT <tasteof_cali> @Xfinity wtf yall customer service is closed  Yall got power outages and shit bt no reps wtf
1268356250871398400 2020-06-03 21:37:49 EDT <kimyaf> No I haven‚Äôt. Is there a way to just see outages by area?
1268355211552325635 2020-06-03 21:33:41 EDT <shanmcdrmtt> is anyone else having WiFi issues?? our xfinity is down and apparently there are issues throughout the city. lots of outages
1268353884441006080 2020-06-03 21:28:25 EDT <SantoSmokey> Today was the worst day for there to be an Xfinity outage lmfao
1268353201675304962 2020-06-03 21:25:42 EDT <SantoSmokey> Today was the worst day for there to be sn Xfinity outage lmfao
1268352952122703872 2020-06-03 21:24:43 EDT <kimyaf> @Xfinity is there an outage? Can I get help with WiFi?
1268350709591953416 2020-06-03 21:15:48 EDT <Gooseguy99> Outages all over the country rn
1268350582173171719 2020-06-03 21:15:18 EDT <SillyJillyStein> I just need to get some work done @Xfinity and don‚Äôt have time for this four hour outage. üò≠üò≠üò≠
1268350326459043842 2020-06-03 21:14:17 EDT <Gooseguy99> This Xfinity outage CANNOT be coincidence.
1268347450856747010 2020-06-03 21:02:51 EDT <Chad_Sowash> You're probably reading this from your phone right now...  #Outage #EMBARRASSING @Xfinity @comcast https://www.theindychannel.com/news/local-news/major-comcast-outage-reported-in-most-of-indiana¬†‚Ä¶
1268345894707085312 2020-06-03 20:56:40 EDT <KatherineR18> Once again @Xfinity show how garbage it is. I keep trying to report an outage with your bot, but apparently we don't have an outage - absolutely ridiculous that I can't report the outage. It's not me or my equipment, it's the storm that just blew through and knocked down branches
1268344541788110856 2020-06-03 20:51:18 EDT <IndianaJedi> I broke out my hotspot to then find out xfinity had an outage all day lol
1268343954761793538 2020-06-03 20:48:58 EDT <man42020> I'm in NWI and our Xfinity is normal. There've been no outages that I know of.   Curious
1268341896713318400 2020-06-03 20:40:47 EDT <eshort05> @Xfinity I like how your outage map doesn‚Äôt work during an outage... but a third party does.
1268341330171879424 2020-06-03 20:38:32 EDT <wantzatc> @Xfinity there seems to be extensive outages. Do you have a resolution plan?
1268341321774895105 2020-06-03 20:38:30 EDT <ajlastname> 3 hours of @Xfinity outage earlier, and now several hours of @IPLPower outage. Nice teamwork! üòÇ
1268340367340044289 2020-06-03 20:34:42 EDT <AdamJoh96745798> now says there are no service outages, but like I said, I reset both my modem and router and I still do not have internet.
1268339966830096389 2020-06-03 20:33:07 EDT <AdamJoh96745798> Yes. When I try to check the outage map, it gives me a 404 access denied response.
1268339382869798913 2020-06-03 20:30:48 EDT <RyansGrammar> *It was Xfinity/Comcast outages, that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt have WiFi or tv for a while.  pic.twitter.com/2U3YQHKpyY
1268339214023823363 2020-06-03 20:30:07 EDT <Xfinity> Hi, are you still finding yourself in an outage?
1268336591904354304 2020-06-03 20:19:42 EDT <bigbob3791> Anyone else think it's odd that we have 'outages' where most of the protests are?
1268332598977232896 2020-06-03 20:03:50 EDT <RealRyanRBLX> It was xfinity / comcast outages that why i dint had wifi or tv for a bit
1268331666843541509 2020-06-03 20:00:08 EDT <P_Hendrickson> I don‚Äôt see how that would help given Xfinity confirmed it was an outage. I would likely only make matters worse if I attempted that. Besides, shortly thereafter my local channels returned.
1268328892454113282 2020-06-03 19:49:07 EDT <BrandonDMay> We went out at work too. They had a multi-state outage.
1268326626925981698 2020-06-03 19:40:06 EDT <Xfinity> We know this is frustrating. Are you seeing any outage completion information in your My Account app?
1268326401922531328 2020-06-03 19:39:13 EDT <Xfinity> Hi. Are you seeing any outage information in your My Account app?
1268325123875934208 2020-06-03 19:34:08 EDT <mataschmata> SO i don't have any solid evidence, but apparently comcast's xfinity outages are happening wherever there are major protests (my city is one of them, im using my backup provider rn) and comcast was also funding/supporting military police departments against protesters So
1268323703353376771 2020-06-03 19:28:29 EDT <Sgtbswife> @Xfinity outages now in Philadelphia suburbs, anyone else experience outage on the east coast?
1268323107330314243 2020-06-03 19:26:07 EDT <Xfinity> Are you having issues with your app to get updates for an outage?
1268323006717349893 2020-06-03 19:25:43 EDT <Capertiller_19> @Xfinity your service in Henrico, Virginia is so trash... y‚Äôall have an outage every mf week... why am I paying good money for good internet, but then I cant use the Internet bc there‚Äôs an outage in the area allll the time?
1268320014420946946 2020-06-03 19:13:50 EDT <P_Hendrickson> After being told 3 times (twice by phone, once by app) that there was an outage, the app asked if I wanted to reset my cable box. I said yes; instead of doing that the app again said there was an outage. Utterly useless.
1268316716368461826 2020-06-03 19:00:44 EDT <dd_hogan> @Xfinity our WiFi is down for almost an hour. Is there an outage in the Bay Area CA?
1268313904905510912 2020-06-03 18:49:33 EDT <dnvrclouds> @Xfinity website is broken, customer service line is nonfunctional, no ability to get in to touch with tech support via phone or internet. Rebooted modem several times. Can't even check for an official "network outage". Pure incompetence & shit customer relations. üôÑüôÑüôÑ
1268312486681481224 2020-06-03 18:43:55 EDT <P_Hendrickson> Actually it looks like some other channels are available, but no local ones. I learned how utterly useless the My @xfinity app is. First it said there was an outage, then it said everything looked fine. Then it went back to saying there was an outage. Even the survey didn‚Äôt work!
1268311492547547136 2020-06-03 18:39:58 EDT <OTVForge> Xfinity outage in Illinois too. GGs only.
1268310842556194816 2020-06-03 18:37:23 EDT <ImageWithVision> .@comcast if you have an outage, don't lie and say you'll be up by a certain time and then keep pushing timeline back #comcastoutage #xfinity #Comcast #Comcastdown

1268304411241013248 2020-06-03 18:11:50 EDT <crosswithyou> Internet has been out at the house for a couple hours now. These outages are becoming way too frequent. Might just be our house though so once again, we have an appointment for Xfinity to come take a look.

1268295868471533570 2020-06-03 17:37:53 EDT <tyler_bilyeu> I decided to get @Xfinity for my family at my late mother‚Äôs house.

1268295527130640384 2020-06-03 17:36:32 EDT <knighthawk1966> New castle, DE here, been out since about 2pm.  No access to account app either.  Not real information from them except they‚Äôre aware of outage reports on social media and to sign into their app to see the outage map.  Which you can‚Äôt do because app not working. Good luck
1268295043225436160 2020-06-03 17:34:36 EDT <christine012674> @Xfinity cable down it this it what your website says ‚ÄúThere are no service outages at your address, but there‚Äôs a possible issue with your equipment.‚Äù It was working fine around 3:45
1268288457132171270 2020-06-03 17:08:26 EDT <blackoil420> Xfinity outage across the entire Midwest. Who else thinks suspects this may be intentional to suppress protest organizing?

1268275187323199498 2020-06-03 16:15:42 EDT <silentk1tt3n> Internet is back but xfinity has a notice on an outage in the area and that it should be fixed by around 8pm tonight. So I expect my net to come and go all day, I will just call off today's stream or do one late in the evening. See how things go and play it by ear unfortunately
1268274763547529216 2020-06-03 16:14:01 EDT <Love_dogs44> There are many other things to do during the #xfinity outage such as
1268274594370203648 2020-06-03 16:13:21 EDT <SuburbsMan> Then tell the people what is going on since there is a nationwide outage of your service including the apps and customer service lines!

1268270964753784833 2020-06-03 15:58:55 EDT <SM_Mulroy> When I had Xfinity, they had a tendency to underpromise on outages/restores, so that‚Äôs good news. Might be able to talk my parents down off the ledge now

1268270569679699969 2020-06-03 15:57:21 EDT <nickalee78> I signed up for the text alerts for @xfinity outages. First text says that there is no outage reported in my area. Twitter says otherwise.
1268270415375470593 2020-06-03 15:56:45 EDT <Noming_Babies> Here is the T-Mobile outage map. Looks pretty close to xfinity‚Äôs outage. My xfinity just came back, you still down?  pic.twitter.com/VxC4LGHXCt
1268270405263003650 2020-06-03 15:56:42 EDT <OwnYourGrind> @Xfinity your outage is now costing me business!!! I expect a refund for the length of the outage.
1268270338787377155 2020-06-03 15:56:26 EDT <coreycaptures> @Xfinity wtf is causing the major Midwest internet outage? You can‚Äôt even put out a reason why? Poor customer service yet again....smh.
1268270190418165760 2020-06-03 15:55:51 EDT <MattL_JG> @Xfinity outage map show much of the Midwest without service.
1268270140476489735 2020-06-03 15:55:39 EDT <zachmanya> Current xfinity outage. Why does this happen every time I get home early and have time to actually relax?? Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu @xfinity  pic.twitter.com/11iGJWNSSB
1268270038823383041 2020-06-03 15:55:15 EDT <GregShoup> #XfinityOutage @Xfinity Our IT is saying a backhoe hit a backbone fiber line around Chicago causing a major outage across much of the Midwest. May be quite a while until it‚Äôs spliced back together
1268270011812130822 2020-06-03 15:55:08 EDT <luvmypuli> I‚Äôm guessing everyone is jumping off of #Xfinity and onto hotspots to figure out what is going on. There is a crazy outage!!
1268269493308055554 2020-06-03 15:53:05 EDT <_youngsanny> Of course Xfinity has an outage while I‚Äôm working home üòì
1268269423451942913 2020-06-03 15:52:48 EDT <AphroditeRise_> Mass xfinity outage in the midwest.
1268269374735110144 2020-06-03 15:52:36 EDT <teliciamonae_> so xfinity has an outage right now until 6 & i work from home , so I‚Äôm basically making free money ü•≥
1268269297891237890 2020-06-03 15:52:18 EDT <__Quanchi> This Nationwide Xfinity outage is not by accident..

1268269106593226767 2020-06-03 15:51:32 EDT <Selo1592> I swear @Xfinity never fuckkn fails to have an outage, I swear If I could legit get any other service like @ATT i‚Äôd be gone in a heart beatüòî
1268269071411359744 2020-06-03 15:51:24 EDT <RhondaHowell17> Xfinity sucks outages in the whole midwest. There is no good company's I nee an antenna!#xfinitysucks

1268268937256435712 2020-06-03 15:50:52 EDT <phillynormal> @Xfinity - what is the eta on fixing the outage in the midwest?
1268268910207537153 2020-06-03 15:50:46 EDT <Mikerser> Well thanks @Xfinity @comcast....realize my internet is down only to further realize I won't be enjoying cable. Try to see the outage, and can't even get into my account page. Thanks for pulling a 2020 on meüòÖüò≠
1268268904431980545 2020-06-03 15:50:44 EDT <Ms_Brwn_Sugar> Xfinity got a lot of people upset right now with their outage...
1268268880285310976 2020-06-03 15:50:39 EDT <garygodsoe> Hearing that #ComcastEthernet or #ComcastBusiness that the #outage is a result of a ‚Äúfiber cut,‚Äù possibly out of Chicago. Is it because of contruction back-hoe mistake...or is some pissed off dude running around the datacenter with a pair of scissors?  #Xfinity #Comcast
1268268871586283523 2020-06-03 15:50:36 EDT <IndyBuckeye414> @VerizonSupport my data has been spotty at best right now during the @xfinity outage. Not sure why
1268268780658012161 2020-06-03 15:50:15 EDT <unuthryear> Since you can no longer speak by phone to an actual person at @comcast @Xfinity @comcastcares , maybe you can update status of power outage in the midwest on social, instead of promoting shit
1268268675481640963 2020-06-03 15:49:50 EDT <DanoH2345> .@Xfinity I‚Äôve had 4 WiFi outages in the last 3 weeks including today‚Äôs in the middle of the work day. You guys are so terrible at providing internet
1268268626785828868 2020-06-03 15:49:38 EDT <NiaThornblossom> @Xfinity Danville, Illinois and several other areas are all down? What is going on? I have tried calling customer service. I can't even view the outage map, troubleshoot, or contact customer service through the website. This is ridiculous.
1268268352419647495 2020-06-03 15:48:33 EDT <RipbergerA> Comcast xfinity has been down for almost an hour and we have heard nothing despite it being a major outage across the entire country. Also having issues with Verizon and saw several other people having issues. @Xfinity @comcast @Verizon
1268268136870141961 2020-06-03 15:47:41 EDT <ciraxx> At&T and well.  This is At&T's outage map.  pic.twitter.com/tuYNkBqSdE

1268268011326263296 2020-06-03 15:47:11 EDT <kathrynort1z> @Xfinity y‚Äôall gonna pay me for the hours of work I have to miss because of the outage?
1268267774058606593 2020-06-03 15:46:15 EDT <IndyBuckeye414> @Xfinity Indiana is out, most of my friends around here and even someone I‚Äôve talked to from Peoria IL has an outage
1268267735731011587 2020-06-03 15:46:06 EDT <angeledyam> Can't say I'm too impressed with @Xfinity @comcastcares @comcast right now. Nationwide outage of their services, and all they do when people ask about internet being down is refer them to log into their account on the website and check the status page, which is currently broken

1268267246704644096 2020-06-03 15:44:09 EDT <andrewstho> Apple ID had major outages yesterday and now Xfinity. Nice.
1268267126940405767 2020-06-03 15:43:40 EDT <MaxLewisTV> This may be counterintuitive since so many are without internet, but @Xfinity is currently experiencing a massive outage affecting mostly the eastern half of the country  pic.twitter.com/NeAY15qZx1

1268267052294438912 2020-06-03 15:43:23 EDT <crantraf> I've got a current xfinity outage and they expect service to be restored at 6:54.  Not 6:53, not 6:55, 6:54.
1268266981159034880 2020-06-03 15:43:06 EDT <musik_muse> So apparently there is a ‚Äúnationwide outage with @Xfinity ... can‚Äôt even look up when outage will be fixed. #comcastoutage pic.twitter.com/VSSJktXpGi
1268266912208822272 2020-06-03 15:42:49 EDT <MarqMerks> So uh.... @Xfinity @comcast @comcastcares you guys going to speak on this national outage that‚Äôs happening for the last 30 minutes or are we just going to act like it‚Äôs not happening.  pic.twitter.com/ErDx2NMj1x
1268266878952185861 2020-06-03 15:42:41 EDT <trevar98508637> I‚Äôm having the same issue... when I go to try and look it says the service outage map is unavailable
1268266850120609794 2020-06-03 15:42:34 EDT <XtraT3rr3sTrio> Just got the word ...Right after preliminary votes the same area has an internet outage with @xfinity lol

1268266777454301184 2020-06-03 15:42:17 EDT <TransTwill> this was downdetector when i looked at it, apparently even xfinity‚Äôs own outage detector is fritzy so it‚Äôs not telling folks they‚Äôre out even in the middle of this mess  pic.twitter.com/Euln5t31u6
1268266763151695875 2020-06-03 15:42:14 EDT <HunterJCullen> There is a massive @xfinity outage throughout the U.S.  Just to let you know.

1268266525154250757 2020-06-03 15:41:17 EDT <jhcox> @Xfinity all services down in Lincoln IL and customer service number is out. Any idea of how long or reasons for the outage.
1268266516304269318 2020-06-03 15:41:15 EDT <garygodsoe> This feels like an attack on #Comcast #Xfinity #Internet. Too wide for some type of failed failover attempt. Outage heat map grows on @downdetector #XfinityOutage #ComcastOutage
1268266453096161280 2020-06-03 15:41:00 EDT <EmoHobo> Imagine a statewide outage in California or New York.  Xfinity would of had a statement ready right away.  An hour and still silence.
1268266432334303234 2020-06-03 15:40:55 EDT <JoeDeacon71> Apparently @comcast /  @Xfinity experiencing a major outage across nation.

1268265000755314688 2020-06-03 15:35:14 EDT <dnvrclouds> @Xfinity are you going to confirm an outage in Colorado? The website is utterly fucking useless, just as useless as the customer service line.

1268264576853966848 2020-06-03 15:33:32 EDT <zyconetic> Another streamer was saying theirs was out as well. Idk if they have Xfinity or not but is this Xfinity wide outage?

1268263803516588036 2020-06-03 15:30:28 EDT <verycoolbrand> super interesting that this internet outage from Xfinity includes areas with a lot of high level protesting happening. im sure it's coincidence :)
1268263787712458753 2020-06-03 15:30:24 EDT <SHalleckmusic> @Xfinity how can I talk to customer service? Phone number doesn't ring. Is there an outage in Muncie, Indiana?
1268263744280449024 2020-06-03 15:30:14 EDT <TinaAdmave> Max: "Moooom! Something is wrong with the internet!"  Me: "Ya, it's off. Now you guys can be productive up there!"  Thanks, Comcast for the outage! üòÇ @Xfinity @comcast #Comcast #Outage
1268263713875902470 2020-06-03 15:30:07 EDT <RealDealMilz> @Xfinity get it together. This outage is ridiculous
1268263585437954049 2020-06-03 15:29:36 EDT <iamJakeBerry> Well this sucks, come home to a internet outage. Thanks @Xfinity   Stream may be canceled. If they get it resolved before 7p I‚Äôll still get on.   I‚Äôll keep y‚Äôall updated.  pic.twitter.com/TuRFU1DO8v
1268263518047924224 2020-06-03 15:29:20 EDT <LuigiTweetsNow> Can you see an outage map without having to login??? Or can you tell me if there‚Äôs an outage in Sacramento? No Internet for the past 20min. üòí
1268263438557593601 2020-06-03 15:29:01 EDT <garygodsoe> #Comcast #Xfinity #Outage is huge!  All throughout central Indiana & Centeal Illinois. Up to Chicago and down to Bloomington, IN. Sure it‚Äôs wider. This is so far. Nothing from @Xfinity @comcastcares & @comcast accounts. 800 number is dead. #XfinityOutage #ComcastOutage
1268263419850833920 2020-06-03 15:28:57 EDT <pasq17> Internet's been down for about half an hour now and can't even properly check status on @Xfinity 's website. Apparently the outage is giant, pretty much all of Indiana and surrounding areas are out...
1268263397990240257 2020-06-03 15:28:51 EDT <sonderous> @Xfinity outage is the last thing I need right now. But if we‚Äôre real honest, when everything in my house goes unresponsive and blinks red at me it just feels like the next logical phase of 2020. I‚Äôm just missing the submarine klaxon horns now.  #workingfromhome
1268263189818507265 2020-06-03 15:28:02 EDT <Dr_AJknowsaword> @Xfinity the midwest is out. To report, we need to log on, and with the outage, how could we? Alerts would be nice....and I certainly hope this is "routine" maintenance as opposed to a calculated outage...
1268263189193658380 2020-06-03 15:28:02 EDT <seandavis32> Baffling that @Xfinity can have an outage for the entire Midwest so casually.
1268263161045680130 2020-06-03 15:27:55 EDT <sean_wize> Can't watch any shows right now cause you're having your monthly outage that will last until who knows...after Obama speaks at 5pm Im sure it'll pop back on miracle style.
1268263121594048512 2020-06-03 15:27:46 EDT <tt_michaelu> @NT_LaSalle is reporting Xfinity outages in LP that match up with downdetector and some other Twitter reactions I've been able to find. Large portions of Illinois, Indiana and Ohio are left without internet access.
1268262932703580166 2020-06-03 15:27:00 EDT <GlowESTBoss> Xfinity having outages all over the country right now. Seems...odd.
1268262815594352646 2020-06-03 15:26:33 EDT <SuburbsMan> Hey @xfinity how about you get a person to take over your twitter account instead of the dumbass bot you use to respond to the nationwide outage. At least tell what the eff is going on. None and I mean none of your services are working.
1268262705942667265 2020-06-03 15:26:06 EDT <ericwilborn> Surprised that no one is covering this widespread @Xfinity outage... their app isn't working, website is slow to load, chat assistant tanking... @cnet @engadget
1268262615215734784 2020-06-03 15:25:45 EDT <iLarmy4> Yes, just had outage
1268262546848518144 2020-06-03 15:25:29 EDT <nickeash> Nothing on their website works either. I found an outage map though and it looks like there are some major issues.  pic.twitter.com/ZxjArJYvAg
1268262430699851781 2020-06-03 15:25:01 EDT <JCPhillipsRadio> Just a heads up... The ripple effect of Comcast/Xfinity outage will have cellular networks taking the load.   Expect every phone network to be slower than normal, as you're sharing that "pipe" with every other customer (of that cellular network) in your community. #comcastoutage
1268262408570712064 2020-06-03 15:24:56 EDT <musik_muse> Yeah it isn‚Äôt working. Logged in and everything. Won‚Äôt even let me look at outage map.
1268262390098952195 2020-06-03 15:24:51 EDT <aecshelton> @Xfinity out for me in South Bend. Anybody else? Seeing reports of outages all the way to Indy? Does this mean my work day is over?üòÅ

1268262135332777984 2020-06-03 15:23:50 EDT <tearbear1104> @Xfinity I believe there‚Äôs a outage in Elkhart,IN I have no internet connection and can‚Äôt access my account on the app or on the web
1268262079020007436 2020-06-03 15:23:37 EDT <mcnakahr> Update: A @Xfinity support rep confirmed there is an outage. Said services may not be up for 3 hours...
1268262052449202176 2020-06-03 15:23:31 EDT <luvmypuli> @Xfinity Remember that day you though June would be the turning point for #2020? Then you panic a little because there is a widespread internet outage and you worry that a hacker is showing us how life as we know it is so dependent on the internet......
1268261965513797633 2020-06-03 15:23:10 EDT <_JacobWagner> Shout out to @Xfinity for having a country wide outage in the middle of a work day... üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª

1268261827001155585 2020-06-03 15:22:37 EDT <CoreyN11388> @Xfinity Is there an outage in Central Illinois? More specifically, the Macon County area. My internet is off, can't connect to the app So I can't even check outages, and calls to Comcast won't go through
1268261702916857857 2020-06-03 15:22:07 EDT <OwenTout1> #xfinity as the outage reaches 40 minutes, i now know that the outage is from indiana to illinois (mostly central illinois) and they are ALL connected to xfinity.
1268261701251710980 2020-06-03 15:22:07 EDT <sincerelytashay> So @Xfinity is going to say nothing about this nationwide outage?  pic.twitter.com/ACaYHPTqfL

1268261578916474881 2020-06-03 15:21:38 EDT <baielala> Thanks. Major outage.  Nothing like working from home and not having Internet.
1268261563707863040 2020-06-03 15:21:34 EDT <SportsbuzzChi> @Xfinity How can I check a app that won't connect? How can I check and outage map that doesn't load? Where can I get reliable internet? Down for 30 mins + with zero comments from Xfinity. This isn't local this is affecting multiple states.
1268261493709160450 2020-06-03 15:21:17 EDT <RachelT1108> @Xfinity Outage in Indiana.  I have no WiFi.  The app is down and so is the website to check status and when I call I get a message stating technical Difficulties and then hangs up.

1268261205069660161 2020-06-03 15:20:09 EDT <Jay_Lynn_Bird> Do you have Xfinity? Apparently they‚Äôre having nationwide outages.
1268261186560233476 2020-06-03 15:20:04 EDT <arguhlin> Sharing because I know internet access is super crucial rn: Xfinity has an outage in the Champaign area & if you have T-Mobile, they are providing 20 extra mb of hotspot data free of charge and tethering your smartphone to your computer is really easy!

1268259910623662080 2020-06-03 15:15:00 EDT <sigtauslimer> So FYI about comcast  / Xfinity.   App wasnt working and their CS number was acting weird too.  Finally got thru to a guy who didnt seem to know there was an outage (and from the tweets I've seen,pretty massive areas shut down). Currently on a call update list but TBD as to a fix
1268259907549253637 2020-06-03 15:14:59 EDT <ericwilborn> @Xfinity So it appears we have an outage, but I can't get the outage map to load to confirm... that's not very helpful
1268259870161154050 2020-06-03 15:14:50 EDT <Uni41900882> Braindead tier -50 tech support doesn't even know several regions are experiencing major outages and replying like it's just a normal person
1268259857410469889 2020-06-03 15:14:47 EDT <ysuindy> Fishers down as well. App says outage of 2500+ customers once I finally got it up
1268259842277376002 2020-06-03 15:14:44 EDT <GradStuden> Same here! There's a text option to check if there's an outage. I texted and it replied "no outage" ! Monopoly at its finest

1268258127100686337 2020-06-03 15:07:55 EDT <TouchedArtist> Nothing like a @Xfinity @comcast outage two hours before the work day ends. This is becoming a serious annoyance on a fairly regular basis. We pay too much for our internet to have these outages as often as we do and they essentially have a monopoly in our area. :-/ #INeedToWork

1268232723644198919 2020-06-03 13:26:58 EDT <gr8_alex> I wonder how @Xfinity / @comcastcares   can think an expected resolution time of 2020-05-30 12:48:24 PM EST is appropriate for an outage that's still going on today: 6/3/2020.
1268219599385841665 2020-06-03 12:34:49 EDT <kthousee> No, no outages. I‚Äôm thinking of canceling my service or upgrading somewhere else bc I can‚Äôt work from home without connection.

1268129019318480896 2020-06-03 06:34:53 EDT <kpitt222> @Xfinity pls fix the outage in the 33185 area ASAP.  I work from home and my kids have school.

1268018449462317058 2020-06-02 23:15:31 EDT <Pop_Zicle> @Xfinity theres 30 notes I have to finish, how much longer until you repair the outage in wicker park.

1267910434335719424 2020-06-02 16:06:18 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Jenn. Has the My Account app reported any area outages in your area?
1267905646332166147 2020-06-02 15:47:17 EDT <kate3robertson> Hi @comcastcares @Xfinity I have had three interruptions in my internet in Chattanooga, TN today. Are there any outages or work being done in the area? How can this be fixed?

1267899115779866624 2020-06-02 15:21:20 EDT <bosoxkris> @comcast - really want to thank you for the continuous internet outages and deciding to work in the area on a Tuesday afternoon.  This really made working from home super efficient and productive. @comcastcares @Xfinity
1267898614912880641 2020-06-02 15:19:20 EDT <KittyRussel1313> Our Mediacom has been out for about an hour.  I wonder how far spread internet outages are spread.
1267897150958186496 2020-06-02 15:13:31 EDT <Xfinity> We can credit your bill due to these outages. DM us here:  https://xfin.tv/support¬† üëà
1267895111783813120 2020-06-02 15:05:25 EDT <victoriaxhorton> @Xfinity so at what point do I get a credit on my account for all of your outages? I was without internet for 9 hours the other day, and am without internet again today.
1267883615570079747 2020-06-02 14:19:44 EDT <DaveHook3> I can't say. I haven't had any issues, but pretty sure it's fine. I use it for  basics, for most part. I can say I recall outages often with @comcast none with @ATT
1267881303497736194 2020-06-02 14:10:33 EDT <rebekahRD> An outage for 4 hours basically from the time the police told us to shut down shops and take cover, until 4:44pm is unacceptable.
1267877062439821312 2020-06-02 13:53:42 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Rebekah. Apologies for the interruption. If there's an outage mentioned on your My Account app, be sure to keep an eye there for updates. You can also sign up for text alerts to be notified of when the service is back up.
1267876741030256640 2020-06-02 13:52:25 EDT <rebekahRD> @Xfinity Why is there an Internet outage in my area when we are under siege daily from looters and rioters targeting our community? How do I listen to police scanners, watch cartoons with my son to keep him calm or watch the news? GET IT TOGETHER! This seems intentional.
1267875279868956672 2020-06-02 13:46:37 EDT <sierruhj> Third outage in the last 3 days in Chicago, after many months of long term outages. It‚Äôs frustrating. Your service issues are keeping me from getting paid
1267874030511669250 2020-06-02 13:41:39 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Mimi, according to the My Account app are you part of an area-wide outage?

1267826523156840449 2020-06-02 10:32:52 EDT <dmathias> @comcastcares @Xfinity how will our account be credited for this persistent outage? Thx.
1267822096303845379 2020-06-02 10:15:17 EDT <jhulud> @Xfinity @comcastcares My Wifi is out once again...and so is my voice/phone service also...the app says no outages in the area but this has been happening every single day a few times daily. I am unable to do any work w/o service. What is going on?!?!
1267817760500809728 2020-06-02 09:58:03 EDT <mylanarose> @Xfinity Thank you for this outage in the middle of my mandatory nclex review session :)
1267807823599198208 2020-06-02 09:18:34 EDT <Im1SpoiledLady> Just received a text saying the issue has been resolved. Outage over. Great! Thanks! I don‚Äôt know if it truly has been resolved or not bc now one half of the city‚Äôs power is out! üò° Hopefully they‚Äôll get it resolved as quickly as you did today!
1267804008871272450 2020-06-02 09:03:25 EDT <Xfinity> Hey. The Xfinity My Account app will provide info on any area outages that are affecting your location. Are you still noticing issues with the service?
1267801544566726656 2020-06-02 08:53:37 EDT <TayeNicole> I hope @Xfinity automatically credits accounts for this outage. Nobody should have to ask for it, this is ridiculous especially now as so many ppl are working and learning remotely.
1267797906230317061 2020-06-02 08:39:10 EDT <Xfinity> First, let's check the My Account app for any service interruptions in your area. If no outages are reported, our support team can take a closer look at what's going on. Send us a DM here:  https://xfin.tv/support¬† and we will assist you.
1267797519565643779 2020-06-02 08:37:37 EDT <saetern_kat> @Xfinity helloooo, is there an outage we don‚Äôt know about?! Trying to work from home and the internet has been down since 1 am ! üò°

1267792314317131784 2020-06-02 08:16:56 EDT <Im1SpoiledLady> @Xfinity can y‚Äôall work a little faster on this outage?? Come on, with #SocialDistancing rule, the Internet is all I got!! I need a credit on my account bc I‚Äôm having to use cellular data!! #XfinityOutageVA

1267696214709067777 2020-06-02 01:55:04 EDT <Endeavr1> the outage map says there is no outage, but people on down detector say there is an outage. my us/ds light is blinking, meaning its not getting signal.
1267693253769510913 2020-06-02 01:43:18 EDT <BOSLIMELIGHT> That moment when you know you‚Äôre not going crazy. @xfinity wants to create outages #comcast #why #smh #fansfustrated  https://instagr.am/p/CA68cDwA4J_/¬† pic.twitter.com/w8FDb8ZUXa
1267686675116941314 2020-06-02 01:17:10 EDT <vthreee> 3rd night in a row with xfinity service dropping in the middle of the night.  Paying for gigabit speeds, and technicians came to the area to fix an outage in sugar land. Seems like they didn‚Äôt fix it. I have to work. @comcastcares @Xfinity  pic.twitter.com/9K0lyRgwZt
1267626216665698305 2020-06-01 21:16:56 EDT <lovealwayskam> Me! Xfinity said there‚Äôs a ‚Äúpower outage‚Äù. How convenient can that be....
1267608540438581250 2020-06-01 20:06:41 EDT <Xfinity> Hey. Have you checked your My Account app to see if there's an outage reported in your area?
1267608325664849920 2020-06-01 20:05:50 EDT <brendanjw> I have too.  I finally got the xfinity status page loaded (via a personal hub) and it says the outage affects up to 2500 accounts.  It's back for the moment.
1267605257569402881 2020-06-01 19:53:39 EDT <thtonehijabi> @Xfinity you BETTER resolve these service outages today and not have these issues when graduation rolls around
1267604756056272896 2020-06-01 19:51:39 EDT <StumpToEmerald> In South Seattle Xfinity/Comcast has had multiple outages, at varying times, all day for different duration. Mobile networks seem congested as well. Was able to verify at the Support site of the outage a few times.
1267602046414393345 2020-06-01 19:40:53 EDT <BenAbramovitz> @Xfinity outage in my area today cost me most of the days work and a lot of money.  Yet no compensation???Time to consider Fios.
1267600043156156420 2020-06-01 19:32:55 EDT <jdob> Drove to Best Buy, bought a new cable modem, installed it, activated it, and in that time I STILL haven't gotten a call back from a human at @Xfinity about my internet outage.
1267597951259406337 2020-06-01 19:24:37 EDT <m_abdol> @Xfinity I‚Äôve been having issues with my network all day and the outage time continues to extend further into the day. The service will work for an hour or two and stop. Definitely impacting my productivity for work and meetings I have.
1267596439850348550 2020-06-01 19:18:36 EDT <kdwesson18> .@Xfinity I am having trouble with my television picture and need technical support. Automated system keeps telling me there is an outage. There is NO outage, but I need to talk to an agent. Please advise.
1267594291125334017 2020-06-01 19:10:04 EDT <LowRizzo> Everyone is having the same issue. It drops but there‚Äôs apparently no outages in my area. About to lose a lot of customers unless you make up for it in a big way.
1267592239682912258 2020-06-01 19:01:55 EDT <molly0xFFF> Xfinity? A different coworker was also having problems with them. Maybe they're having an outage...

1267532856282226689 2020-06-01 15:05:57 EDT <Drew_33> @Xfinity WiFi outages in South Boston again. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre aware. When can we expect uninterrupted service?

1267462887351685120 2020-06-01 10:27:55 EDT <NotSimplyStassi> @Xfinity Y‚Äôall force an outage at 10 AM on a Monday, knowing people are working from home and have the nerve to only give me a raggedy ass $5 credit.
1267452216304119809 2020-06-01 09:45:31 EDT <LetsGo_Ugo> Xfinity really going to make me fall behind with work with this outage bullshit

1267217033944608773 2020-05-31 18:10:59 EDT <DvineAmbition> @Xfinity how long is this so called outage...I‚Äôm sick of y‚Äôall! It‚Äôs always something....
1267208059002195969 2020-05-31 17:35:19 EDT <Julianne_T_> They really are. I‚Äôm so frustrated. This has been happening almost weekly now. That‚Äôs on top of the outages that seem to happen every month.
1267205051870851075 2020-05-31 17:23:22 EDT <goldenflwr_> WHICH ONE OF YALL CAUSE AN OUTAGE AT XFINITY BECAUSE MY INTERNET NOT WORKING NOW SMH
1267203719076163584 2020-05-31 17:18:04 EDT <TORIANAJONES> @Xfinity  I have been experiencing a TV and internet outage since 10AM. I've been trying to reach technical support since 10AM as well with no luck. My devices have been refreshed a million times and I still can't get connected.
1267187350838247424 2020-05-31 16:13:02 EDT <djobs35> I can always count on @Xfinity to have outages as I try to work from home. No TV or internet and I‚Äôm guessing there will be zero credit on my next bill. Comcast/Xfinity sucks!
1267178688023592960 2020-05-31 15:38:36 EDT <Jahnnnnn> There‚Äôs an @Xfinity outage in our area at the same time every single day. WHY!
1267175082172067843 2020-05-31 15:24:17 EDT <blank83362043> These outages are all the time prime example of why I‚Äôm switching from @Verizon and going to @Xfinity
1267161415460290561 2020-05-31 14:29:58 EDT <kaltepeter> @comcast @Xfinity very smart plan. Not allowing customers to report an outage if the modem is 'having issues', complete stall tactic, modems will have issues when there is an outage. I have at least a handful of neighbors with no internet and they still say 'no outage'.  https://twitter.com/kaltepeter/status/1267145709821755394¬†‚Ä¶
1267159938377211904 2020-05-31 14:24:06 EDT <DevolutionMan> My internet keeps going up and down in Wa Tacoma Hill Top area. Any outages @Xfinity ?

1267103417673146369 2020-05-31 10:39:31 EDT <JustErinSmith> @Xfinity @comcast @comcastcares we‚Äôve been experiencing outages for 3 weeks that have caused me to be behind with work. We‚Äôve had 3 different modems. And when we call we can‚Äôt talk to a person/ don‚Äôt get a call back. This is extremely frustrating!
1267075456290955266 2020-05-31 08:48:24 EDT <mesprime> @Xfinity @comcastcares @comcast I understand you are only sending out tech for full service interruptions. My service is virtually useless due to the constant outages (several times an hour). Of course, when you check, its up, but never for long.  Unacceptable
1266913215352647686 2020-05-30 22:03:43 EDT <geliazar95> @comcastcares Hello, I am having trouble accessing Xfinity Stream via the app on IPhone and on Roku Xfinity Beta in Chicago. Is their a current outage?
1266860802608422912 2020-05-30 18:35:27 EDT <ThatRogue> @comcast @comcastcares @Xfinity This is a bad time to have an outage.  No issues with the weather...so what‚Äôs the problem?
1266857335689031680 2020-05-30 18:21:40 EDT <TippyShortSocks> @Xfinity @comcast Your customer service is absolutely abhorrent. During the time where internet service is of the utmost importance, I have an outage and I can‚Äôt get anyone on the phone. All we have in the moment is internet for communication and work. Absolute crap.
1266812932287070208 2020-05-30 15:25:13 EDT <alphadk116> @Xfinity why can‚Äôt I just talk to an agen about my internet outage? Is it because I‚Äôm black? Try calling many times can‚Äôt talk to an agent. Internet is our. Yes, my modem has been resetted many times. I know more about computers than your tech, I can‚Äôt get thru to an operator.
1266733950057103366 2020-05-30 10:11:23 EDT <evasmiles_3> My boss scheduled me to work today 7am to 7pm to make up my time I didn‚Äôt work cause xfinity had an outage yesterday.
1266733824127504384 2020-05-30 10:10:53 EDT <SCrystalRubio> Xfinity really got an outage right now ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1266724173247852546 2020-05-30 09:32:32 EDT <frozetoes> @comcastcares I signed up for text notifications regarding service outages.  What a joke. I received a text from Comcast/Xfinity telling me "Service has been restored" I received this 12 HOURS AFTER IT WAS RESTORED.  Thanks for the "update".
1266724053898932225 2020-05-30 09:32:03 EDT <jeffreysadezwi1> Yeah that is a problem it‚Äôs not in every  neighborhood but if you can get it they have OANN and I never had a outage with it and if there‚Äôs a problem they come right out when they say they will be there they are unlike the cable company
1266718893348970496 2020-05-30 09:11:33 EDT <SocialJusticeXX> @comcast YOUR SERVICE CONSISTENCY SUCKS!!!! üò° Sooo tired of consistent outages!!! Now is not the time. We pay TOO MUCH for unreliable service!!! If our electricity went out as much as #Comcast #Xfinity there would be OUTRAGE!Look at your stats! Fix areas with excessive outages!

1266611922390052864 2020-05-30 02:06:29 EDT <chissington> Hey @Xfinity got some bad connection issues here in Central Valley, CA. What is up??? Can‚Äôt find outage reports
1266608287220248577 2020-05-30 01:52:02 EDT <BStheBrain> @Xfinity @CityofNewcastle WiFi/Internet has been down for 24 hours and I have a job and my kids have school/soccer assignments. Thanks for the $30 credit but at this time I would be willing to pay 10X that to have things repaired on this ‚Äòarea outage‚Äô. Can you advise????
1266539599410626566 2020-05-29 21:19:06 EDT <Xfinity> Be sure to check your My Account app to track your service and find updates on the status of your outage.
1266520877912354816 2020-05-29 20:04:42 EDT <BraeNord> To my knowledge the outage continues and it's been going since I woke up...
1266504708690231298 2020-05-29 19:00:27 EDT <NwhiteScarlet> @Xfinity mass outage in east Memphis
1266504683033509888 2020-05-29 19:00:21 EDT <Athoughtsoup> @Xfinity ok, first they said cable will be restored by 12:30pm. Then, they said it will be restored when they can. Now they're saying at 10:30pm.  More than 12 hours without service on a Friday. And a total of nearly 7 days worth of outages since Jan 2020. @comcast fail.
1266504373682741254 2020-05-29 18:59:07 EDT <NwhiteScarlet> @xfinity mass outage in east memphis. Witten and Macon area
1266499508663472132 2020-05-29 18:39:47 EDT <AldenTheAwesome> @Xfinity  we‚Äôve had 3 outages now in the past few weeks, each lasting more than 4 hours.  Is this being addressed or is me losing half a day‚Äôs work each week bc my internet goes out part of the new normal?
1266497585939984384 2020-05-29 18:32:09 EDT <AdamCh_p> Internet outage for Comcast Xfinity on Feronia Ave in Saint Paul. Does this have to do with the riots? @comcastcares @Xfinity @comcast  No internet since 2am this morning.
1266495244566134784 2020-05-29 18:22:51 EDT <GitGudTheo> Every time I have checked (or remember to check lol) it doesn‚Äôt say anything about an outage in the area. It just shuts off anywhere between 3am and 5am every night to every other night. It‚Äôs consistent.
1266494551478300673 2020-05-29 18:20:06 EDT <BraeNord> Not to be difficult, but how do you, automated response, know "techs are working to get everything restored ASAP" when my location, and therefore the outage in question, are unclear via this platform? I've called in 4+ times over the last 6-8 hours and the 'updates' are identical
1266491428768821249 2020-05-29 18:07:41 EDT <SkybloxS> The issue is fixed, atleast in my area the outage has been fixed
1266487716591656960 2020-05-29 17:52:56 EDT <iWear_TheTiara> I'm making it my damn mission to get a new internet provider this weekend. Xfinity and these power outages are going to drive me crazy!!!
1266487233470541824 2020-05-29 17:51:01 EDT <Athoughtsoup> @Xfinity ok Can'tcast. This is now the second longest outage this year in a year thats now had more outages than I can recall in my area.   Did Comcast lose all its competent staff and now has to read the manual every time there's an outage before they can fix the issue?
1266479173591339008 2020-05-29 17:18:59 EDT <TheCrittaC> Everyone likes to bitch about @Xfinity but today I had my first outage in like 6 years and it only lasted like 20 minutes
1266473289813131264 2020-05-29 16:55:36 EDT <HeyItsMeBex> @KIRO7Seattle @KING5Seattle @komonews Can anyone cover the internet outage with @Xfinity impacting parts of South King County since 8:20am? Estimated restoration time of 12:31 came and went.
1266464215361085448 2020-05-29 16:19:33 EDT <DrCCedillo> There's a reported outage a few miles away. Would that affect this? Also, just spoke with a tech. They're sending someone Monday so thank you!
1266462079919067137 2020-05-29 16:11:04 EDT <AxCJ1> Man, @Xfinity always having a damn outage  pic.twitter.com/UHejQpBRfR
1266460638450089985 2020-05-29 16:05:20 EDT <BraeNord> @Xfinity there's been a internet outage  all morning and into the afternoon. It has cost me a lot of work time and frustration. I've struggled to get meaningful updates on when I can expect service again. This is the second time recently with a major outage during the work day.
1266458806432731136 2020-05-29 15:58:03 EDT <Xfinity> Hey. Have you checked your My Account app to see if there's an outage in your area?
1266449146765963264 2020-05-29 15:19:40 EDT <Terra_Forever> Funny it just came back! Maybe the internet found out I contacted you and got scared so it came back lol. But tbh I'm worried it won't be back for long; it's been so up and down. When we've checked the app it just said there's an outage. No other info.
1266447221639315457 2020-05-29 15:12:01 EDT <golfer1303> No outages - but there was a reminder to tighten my cables.
1266433686871908363 2020-05-29 14:18:14 EDT <elidawitthoeft> Hey @Xfinity No outages reported in my area, but no MSNBC. What gives?
1266429994974224384 2020-05-29 14:03:34 EDT <TheLegend3526> For the 2nd time this week an Xfinity outage has caused me to not only disconnect and lose a game but also stop my stream outright. ü§¨
1266420173449330690 2020-05-29 13:24:32 EDT <TheMeanBlackGrl> How is she still talking!?! Jesus be an Xfinity outage! üò©üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠  pic.twitter.com/Xe1HgMvJkd
1266407464049627141 2020-05-29 12:34:02 EDT <DrKrisBiotech> Currently experiencing an #XfinityOutage and my account seems to be out too. Xfinity chat just makes you go around in circles with a notice that I can‚Äôt speak with an agent so they can attend to more important issues like ... ‚Äúoutages‚Äù.
1266390474333585414 2020-05-29 11:26:32 EDT <wewantMor_> we‚Äôll be cancelling our services w| you all this weekend. every week there‚Äôs been an outage w| false estimates of when the outage will be resolved. during a time where so many people are working from home, y‚Äôall should get it together. it‚Äôs been a few months.
1266368966248689665 2020-05-29 10:01:04 EDT <16lakerGus> No looks like there was an outage in my area but everything is running normal now
1266366083704827905 2020-05-29 09:49:36 EDT <wewantMor_> is it EVERY week there has to be an outage? @Xfinity  pic.twitter.com/gfOkoKWbjU
1266365353640120322 2020-05-29 09:46:42 EDT <joseloyola1686> Anyone else in #Roxborough have an #xfinity outage? üò¶ #Philadephia
1266362107391606784 2020-05-29 09:33:48 EDT <unhassledHoff> Seriously. @Xfinity outage map puts me dead center in the triangle of THREE outages (one for my zip code) but gives a message saying there's no outage at my address...
1266360945208688640 2020-05-29 09:29:11 EDT <comcast> Ok since the message has changed to a video outage, you can keep track of an ETA for service restoration through the Xfinity My Account app or by logging into the status center here:  https://comca.st/3dftvbE¬† -Gabbie

1266358141496840192 2020-05-29 09:18:03 EDT <meggersrad> @Xfinity so the time to fix the outage has come and gone. When can I expect an updated time on this??
1266357709055635458 2020-05-29 09:16:20 EDT <Xfinity> Thanks for the update. You can report an outage by following the instructions here:  https://comca.st/2yGIyfg¬†
1266356495421190145 2020-05-29 09:11:30 EDT <thered18> Still no tv anywhere in the west 7th st area by high bridge. Out since midnight but yet your website says "no outages" check our neighborhood fb page thousands are out of service
1266351316516945923 2020-05-29 08:50:56 EDT <comcast> Hi Shawn. Sorry we missed you. Anytime you want to check the status of your services, open the Xfinity My Account app. You'll see any information that's available on planned maintenance, outages, ways to troubleshoot, pay your bill and more. -Gabbie
1266346231762169856 2020-05-29 08:30:43 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Megan. Check the Xfinity My Account app for updates on outages.
1266345342024527872 2020-05-29 08:27:11 EDT <axsmithsports> I'm in downtown St. Paul, we haven't had any power issues down here, just cable outage, that ironically cut off minutes into Mayor Frey's speech after 1am.
1266344597216808960 2020-05-29 08:24:14 EDT <meggersrad> Hey @Xfinity haven‚Äôt had a cable outage in the 9 years I‚Äôve lived here. Morning I‚Äôd like to hear more about Minneapolis being up in flames and hear thr news, you‚Äôre having an outage? Think we can get this resolves already? It‚Äôs been an hour since I have been up wanting coverage
1266325545022783488 2020-05-29 07:08:31 EDT <albertoramirez> oh it's an xfinity service outage. i thought twitter finally folded.
1266231989184589827 2020-05-29 00:56:46 EDT <SebastianMrinez> Yo @Xfinity are you going to stop having outages? This is the 5th in two days... @ATT is looking more powerful rn
1266228503550271488 2020-05-29 00:42:55 EDT <John_A_W> Very edge of Uptown, safe and secure. Never the fuck ever seen this before. Now @Xfinity claiming outage until morning.
1266220931741028352 2020-05-29 00:12:50 EDT <John_A_W> @Xfinity claiming some kind of outage in @CityMinneapolis ? Fortunately I'm a rich white hipster who can afford a phone w/ Internet to watch @UR_Ninja coverage of #minneapolisriots. History happening here. #BlackLivesMatter üëá
1266210569834635266 2020-05-28 23:31:39 EDT <originalneglet> Of course there‚Äôs no reported outage at my address, @Xfinity, your system is an endless feedback loop that won‚Äôt let me report it!
1266194648290062337 2020-05-28 22:28:23 EDT <16lakerGus> @Xfinity why is my tv an internet not working is there an outage just paid the bill
1266186324450705409 2020-05-28 21:55:19 EDT <DarrellWard_> @Xfinity so those that are experiencing an outage have to wait until 1:20 AM ?! Really  doesn‚Äôt take you guys that long to take the payments out of my account every month even during a Pandemic smdh
1266183959869820936 2020-05-28 21:45:55 EDT <Xfinity> Is there an outage being reported in your area?
1266182189734981634 2020-05-28 21:38:53 EDT <StarOnTwitch> So. Internet down. Like, dead dead. Sorry @rpggh0st that our games got fucked. Sorry @HarshRealityGG fam that my debut stream got cut short.   @Xfinity fuck you very much for the outage! It‚Äôs 2020 and your overpriced internet is literally the worst. Cant wait to switch providers.
1266180640560558081 2020-05-28 21:32:43 EDT <Pays2Listen> Xfinity has an outage every time a drop of water fall outta the sky.
1266179957711085581 2020-05-28 21:30:01 EDT <troyglidden> nevermind. my issue has been resolved finally.  not sure if outage or not, but it's resolved.
1266179728085585921 2020-05-28 21:29:06 EDT <Hexxusss> Barely had xfinity service for a week and there‚Äôs already an outage expected to last til after 1AM. No wonder they‚Äôre trash.
1266177579075072000 2020-05-28 21:20:33 EDT <jasontemple> ugh @comcast @Xfinity total outage.  restarted router, still nothing.  what gives.
1266169456251699200 2020-05-28 20:48:17 EDT <victoriaxhorton> The best part of this @Xfinity outage is that there‚Äôs nothing I can do. Can‚Äôt go into the office, can‚Äôt work from a coffee shop, just stuck at home with no internet going on 7 hours now üòÇ
1266149399228567554 2020-05-28 19:28:35 EDT <BridgettColling> @comcastcares Experiencing a connection outage for a few hours now. Looks like an Xfinity person came by our unit early but still no ability to connect to WiFi. Anything else I need to do to get this fixed?
1266133747029741569 2020-05-28 18:26:23 EDT <LiveBreatheTek> Why is @Xfinity taking its sweet time to resolve this outage. You claim you are working as fast as possible to fix it, said it would be done by 6pm now it‚Äôs updated to 9 to close to 10pm. Internet was working fine all these months, why touch things and break them?
1266131823232417794 2020-05-28 18:18:44 EDT <GinaLuvsJJ48> (1 of 2) Internet has been down in the entire neighborhood for TWO DAYS, but @Xfinity says there's no widespread outage because no one has called? Try the fact you can't get a human on the phone and when they say they'll return your call in a few minutes, they really mean never!
1266125649045008384 2020-05-28 17:54:12 EDT <DebEsq> @Xfinity  The internet outage in 15317 is not helpful in allowing me to meet my work deadlines.  Status on service restoration??
1266111955602980866 2020-05-28 16:59:48 EDT <marcottematt1> @Xfinity sucks. Outage In my area with no notification. Everyone‚Äôs working from home, fix your business!!
1266106603033358336 2020-05-28 16:38:31 EDT <fadedroach> Constant outages
1266100119272919047 2020-05-28 16:12:46 EDT <sjmbbriley> @comcastcares I have been hung up on three times the automated system asking for an operator I need help with incorrect billing address that y'all put on my account and I'm not calling back the 1-800 Xfinity number again I'm sitting here without internet because of outage area
1266098652671553538 2020-05-28 16:06:56 EDT <SaveDeJ_> Might not be able to stream today. Whole area having an internet outage. Xfinity is so trash
1266089947586531333 2020-05-28 15:32:20 EDT <Xfinity> We know staying connected is important. Are you seeing an estimated time of competition for your outage in your My Account app?
1266087740426399746 2020-05-28 15:23:34 EDT <RMendelsonPhD> @Xfinity internet is a failure today.... many service outages and many customers let down.also, almost no way to speak with a #humanbeing for support by telephone. Your #CEO has obliterated your #CustServ quality.
1266082407553236992 2020-05-28 15:02:23 EDT <teresa> just sent my info yet again...we again had another brief outage today.
1266077362023731207 2020-05-28 14:42:20 EDT <Juicygotemcrazy> @comcast fix my damn service I'm working from home and you guys have an outage till 6pm @Xfinity @comcastcares
1266073896631054336 2020-05-28 14:28:34 EDT <doc4153> @Xfinity 2 days in a row there have been outages in my area. Due to naint. I have video conferences scheduled with work & not able to attend because of this. This is unacceptable. I signed up with Comcast for reliability. Not to lose my job because you bring the system down.
1266070406131220485 2020-05-28 14:14:41 EDT <Xfinity> Hey - are you experiencing outages or having trouble with your devices staying connected?
1266064732248846338 2020-05-28 13:52:09 EDT <ATHEricG> A special shout out to Eric and Jeff at Xfinity for getting a couple of trucks out here and getting this outage fixed. Nice work guys! Now...back to work for me! Seriously....Thanks for the help guys!  -Eric G  pic.twitter.com/tkxcpfwqBi
1266053618710589441 2020-05-28 13:07:59 EDT <Reubnick> @Xfinity I hope I don‚Äôt get fired from my job due to your company‚Äôs inability to provide me the internet I pay for. And now an outage? Until 2, your rep tells me. Two hours without the internet I NEED for my job. Unacceptable. I pay money monthly and I get screwed over constantly
1266051954477797377 2020-05-28 13:01:22 EDT <Xfinity> That's definitely not the experience we want for you. When you're experiencing the outage is there an indication at  https://xfin.tv/status¬† about the type issue and an estimated time to repair? (1/2)
1266038082895306757 2020-05-28 12:06:15 EDT <__DaaaamnBria> @Xfinity you are making it extremely hard for me to work from home. There has been an outage in my area for the entire week, at the peak of work hours. Quite frankly, I don‚Äôt appreciate it.
1266034010163236872 2020-05-28 11:50:04 EDT <Legxcy1026> I just love how whenever there‚Äôs an outage in the area.. @xfinity never says shit..on their website or twitter account..they‚Äôre the exact definition of  pic.twitter.com/krRv3iMYNH
1266033644386291713 2020-05-28 11:48:37 EDT <JeffreyToms2> Second outage in less than 24 hours. Comcast/Xfinity feckless!
1266033451817480194 2020-05-28 11:47:51 EDT <joelneely> Just had my daily @Xfinity outage. Network failure during a conference call. @comcastcares ?
1266032766434582528 2020-05-28 11:45:07 EDT <Im_A_City_Boy> Technology ain‚Äôt perfect but Comcast xfinity charges way too much to be having so many internet outages smh
1266023442098225152 2020-05-28 11:08:04 EDT <davebei> My Xfinity internet has been reasonably stable. Short outages a couple of times a week, but not too bad. My neighbor had so many problems he finally switched to CenturyLink fiber, which is available in our area, and has reported much better results.
1266022597449388032 2020-05-28 11:04:43 EDT <Xfinity> Hi there. If you're experiencing frequent outages, our team can look into what's going on in your area. Send us a DM at  https://xfin.tv/support¬† with your info.
1266007183017291777 2020-05-28 10:03:28 EDT <Patelankit186> @Xfinity not sure what's happening in 22911 but lately so many outages, today I got disconnected from very important meeting and now I can't join back in until I get the internet. This is really frustrating and it will cost me.   Could you guys come to a permanent solution??
1266003050730119169 2020-05-28 09:47:03 EDT <teresa> I‚Äôve sent my info the last 3 days and also called the last 2 days. I keep hearing ‚Äòthere is no planned outage tomorrow‚Äô but yet we have an outage again. I just want to know what is going on.
1266000606776492038 2020-05-28 09:37:20 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Mary! If you're in an area outage, keep an eye on your My Account app for updates. We're working to get you back up and running ASAP.
1265999980696756225 2020-05-28 09:34:51 EDT <murralis> @Xfinity - I know why I‚Äôm experiencing at outage. Please help, I‚Äôve got a job interview today and need internet to participate.  pic.twitter.com/vNsnT8TtOM
1265981913371680769 2020-05-28 08:23:03 EDT <9muir> We will always remember the Xfinity outage a month ago, and fighting with Windows and an iPhone hotspot. I think in the end I gave up
1265935137373483010 2020-05-28 05:17:11 EDT <AVicariousCycle> Funny that‚Äôs what they say to me to. And I live in Portland. The outage map is basically the entire US rn
1265934664591724545 2020-05-28 05:15:18 EDT <FlowMerchant> These @Xfinity outages are annoying. Feels like it's been consistent the past couple of weeks. Always around 2am.
1265905691493109761 2020-05-28 03:20:10 EDT <heelthedan> timkawakami: Xfinity rolling outages. So it goes.
1265892254666969089 2020-05-28 02:26:47 EDT <TomDomo_> @Xfinity so I have an outage in my area. Any idea when service will be back up?
1265876320938049538 2020-05-28 01:23:28 EDT <MaplesDestiny> Fuck xfinity for always having outages.
1265870744996794369 2020-05-28 01:01:19 EDT <CheesyyMariee_> Xfinity really pissing me off acting like a little rain causing outages every fucking week rs
1265862086715793413 2020-05-28 00:26:54 EDT <davbarlin> @Xfinity why do you make me register for outage texts every fricking time there is an outage... after I spend 5 minutes trying to figure out what‚Äôs going on.  Just send me a text if there is an outage.
1265850441167974401 2020-05-27 23:40:38 EDT <mikesilva27> Another outage?! @Xfinity
1265835978670796800 2020-05-27 22:43:10 EDT <tomcrabtree> Week 3 of @xfinity hell. Constant internet outages. Spoken to them multiple times. Apparently they are ‚Äòdoing work‚Äô in the area. Never gets resolved. Repeat. How do these corporations get away with this?!
1265833639465672705 2020-05-27 22:33:52 EDT <gtobrian1> @Xfinity is there an outage??? i was top 5 in warzone with my team and it randomly went out üòî
1265825859828514830 2020-05-27 22:02:57 EDT <gambino> I just spoke to your team again who said this is an @AppleSupport problem. I don't know how losing my wifi after an Xfinity outage can be a hardware issue? I really need your help resolving this ASAP, please.
1265824881247162368 2020-05-27 21:59:04 EDT <Xfinity> Be sure to check your My Account to track your services and find updates on the current status of the outage. If you have additional questions reach out to our support team on Twitter here:  https://xfin.tv/support¬†.
1265820332117483520 2020-05-27 21:40:59 EDT <teresa> ok I'm going to get this off my chest and I'll probably delete this later - I'm 99% positive the reason my building has experienced Xfinity Wifi outages every day for the last 5 days (including today) is because we are in downtown Oakland. I would put $$ on their servers....
1265815848519790597 2020-05-27 21:23:10 EDT <gambino> @Xfinity I've spent 11 hours today trying to get access to my wifi after your outage last night in Marin. No one from your team has helped. I'm WFH and my son is LFH. Neither of us can do either without WiFi. Help, please!
1265807921792929792 2020-05-27 20:51:40 EDT <FierceWarrior15> @metronetfiber I am a new hire working from home for a Fortune 500 company. The outage resulted in unscheduled time away from work (and likely unpaid) from 9:38am-3:30pm. When will internet be restored? I will connect me new @Xfinity tomorrow PM.
1265801914798628871 2020-05-27 20:27:48 EDT <teresa> Also Xfinity Servers are completely overwhelmed and that's why the outages are happening every day at around the same time...I get it especially with everyone WFH but come on just be honest.
1265792077058760710 2020-05-27 19:48:43 EDT <Bryan_Nader> @comcastcares @Xfinity second time in two weeks my internet went out due to an ‚Äúunplanned‚Äù outage. I want a refund
1265790432723648514 2020-05-27 19:42:11 EDT <teresa> I don't hold this against the new place :) I just need a new wifi company. will call tonight or tomorrow to get a new wifi company because clearly @Xfinity isn't cutting it! 5 days in a row of outages doesn't help ANYONE work from home.
1265786720991109122 2020-05-27 19:27:26 EDT <rkstephens200> 10 hours without internet service while trying to work from home. Great job @Xfinity! I lost a whole day of work because of your outage!
1265782740873629701 2020-05-27 19:11:37 EDT <andrewcirko> @comcastcares your support page says to go to the Xfinity Status Center to report an outage, so I did and there is no place to report it. Internet has been off and on for three days now and TV is either out or very pixillated. I'm in zip 21014
1265781114725113856 2020-05-27 19:05:09 EDT <Xfinity> If there was an outage in the area, you wouldn't have any connection at all.  What speeds are you getting directly hardwired into the modem?
1265777814009262080 2020-05-27 18:52:02 EDT <ShadowzPanda> @Xfinity I have 600 Megas plan and I'm getting only 30 Megas. Any internet outages?
1265769571346264066 2020-05-27 18:19:17 EDT <OoohKay_> Then @Xfinity talking about an outage in the area. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1265750062031912961 2020-05-27 17:01:45 EDT <lachelle_shayla> Really starting to hate Xfinity ! It‚Äôs a outage every week feel like
1265742902463991809 2020-05-27 16:33:18 EDT <justxfred> @Xfinity damn how many outages does it take to get this right. One yesterday and one today. Nobody picking up the phones. I need some money off this bill ASAP!  https://twitter.com/justxfred/status/1265313745724674049¬†‚Ä¶
1265742639988723712 2020-05-27 16:32:16 EDT <PMJordannn> Not at all shocked that there‚Äôs an @Xfinity outage right now üòíüòí
1265738946731900934 2020-05-27 16:17:35 EDT <timkawakami> Xfinity rolling outages. So it goes.
1265737936911437832 2020-05-27 16:13:35 EDT <FulhamNick> An incredible experience right before our eyes about to take place and there‚Äôs and outage. Thanks @Xfinity. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Always stellar with your bad timing. üö´üöÄ
1265731819128991745 2020-05-27 15:49:16 EDT <Chrisuasion> @Xfinity how many damn times Is y‚Äôall gone have a outage I‚Äôm tryna watch the 100 and y‚Äôall fucking that up like damn it‚Äôs up setting me and my home girl if we can‚Äôt get on Netflix then where the hell can we go üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§. @imjohnnice
1265731797251489792 2020-05-27 15:49:11 EDT <PrettyMuchSK> @Xfinity - How can u guys do an 10 hour outage without notifying? And ur cust support punks dont even know there is an outage? During COVID ppl are working from home and an outage should atleast be notified so that we can prepare accordingly.  pic.twitter.com/TStCEvw0u6
1265729053442453504 2020-05-27 15:38:17 EDT <omeramiri> CaUsE tHeRE iS a SeRvICe OuTaGe
1265725175481405440 2020-05-27 15:22:52 EDT <crsofr> Oh it‚Äôs definitely trying to say it‚Äôs a me thing. Even though there is a TV outage in the area affecting 2500 customers. Seems like Internet went with it.
1265724835617034240 2020-05-27 15:21:31 EDT <grantzprice> Have you logged in from the IP that experiencing the outage using the username and password you setup 10 years ago to report the outage using a form that tries to convince you it's a you thing, not a them thing?
1265722090549735425 2020-05-27 15:10:37 EDT <samudraNB> Restarted modem, etc. But is there an outage? The outage map simultaneously says ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no outage‚Äù and also shows a big red exclamation mark near me
1265718611626340359 2020-05-27 14:56:47 EDT <Xfinity> You can stay updated with all outage information through the Xfintiy My Account app.
1265718406394724352 2020-05-27 14:55:58 EDT <DigitalSecArch> Having used a 2-WAN router with Xfinity and CenturyLink for more than 2 years, my experience is that outage detection is the challenge.  Which risks you mitigate also matter - less than half the time was failover possible.  E.g. CL often affected by same hazards.
1265716189893922821 2020-05-27 14:47:10 EDT <Ainesey_M> @Xfinity Fix your outages!!!
1265702912132395008 2020-05-27 13:54:24 EDT <loboholic> Awesome. Yet ANOTHER xfinity internet outage.
1265701329676259328 2020-05-27 13:48:07 EDT <Xfinity> Hey. You can check for outages and service interruptions in your area using the My Account app. If you do not have the My Account app you can locate it here:  https://comca.st/3c5PS1S¬†.
1265691849265516544 2020-05-27 13:10:26 EDT <jrshah> @comcast @Xfinity 3 consecutive days of outages for nearly 3hrs with no warnings. #monopoly
1265691567765041155 2020-05-27 13:09:19 EDT <Bulls_Jay> yes the outage map is still showing tons of outages all over the north side of Chicago where i live.
1265690339152723968 2020-05-27 13:04:26 EDT <Bulls_Jay> Legitimately not mad but very impressed by this @Xfinity outage in Chicago that has lasted over a full day for me.
1265683036890451970 2020-05-27 12:35:25 EDT <MaryTaReason> @Xfinity #Xfinity is the worst unreliable internet service when internet is so critical because many work from home trying to provide for our families during these tough times! Have an outage everyday but nothing is being done about it!
1265682678696812544 2020-05-27 12:34:00 EDT <MaryTaReason> @Xfinity Everyday around the same time I experience an outage and you‚Äôve done nothing about it. I expect reliable service but you aren‚Äôt providing it yet still taking my money for a shitty service. I was told that no technician can be sent out but you‚Äôre still charging me $$$
1265682281802448901 2020-05-27 12:32:25 EDT <wonderboynj> I‚Äôve been waiting in a chat queue for Advanced Repair with @Xfinity for an hour, it‚Äôs now switched to please expect extended wait times.  Now I think it‚Äôs just dead.  Two weeks of daily outages! UGH
1265677567379587085 2020-05-27 12:13:41 EDT <Xfinity> Restarting your router can often fix these issues. If that doesn't work, you can use the My Account app to see if you're in an outage.
1265672129443500038 2020-05-27 11:52:05 EDT <mxxdprints> Yooo @Xfinity is there any information on a possible Chicago outage?
1265670682362417152 2020-05-27 11:46:20 EDT <chris_c_lucas> Yep‚Ä¶‚ÄùOutage in your area‚Äù have had issues for weeks now.
1265669544963686400 2020-05-27 11:41:49 EDT <chris_c_lucas> Really getting tired of @Xfinity outages. I get bandwidth is probably high with all the WFH, but damn.
1265667569446531073 2020-05-27 11:33:58 EDT <NalzWrites> The Midwest's Comcast, mediacom, has had two outages this week.
1265665897584144385 2020-05-27 11:27:19 EDT <ChiswickGryphon> 2 weeks of repeated daily outages and the ISP is doing everything but addressing the actual problem. I know it's common knowledge but if you can help it, never sign up for @Xfinity.
1265665402543226880 2020-05-27 11:25:21 EDT <MbtaJae> And don't even get me started on how much of a shit show having @Xfinity as our only ISP option is!!!!!   (I was on hold with them for 30 mins before they would acknowledge that there was a legit outage and it wasn't just me being a dumbass who doesn't know how to use a router)
1265662454941581319 2020-05-27 11:13:38 EDT <kevinspellman> We‚Äôve had an ‚Äúunplanned outage‚Äù every day since Sunday.
1265662095355514880 2020-05-27 11:12:13 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Kevin. We'll keep you updated on any outages through the Xfinity My Account app.
1265642979269672965 2020-05-27 09:56:15 EDT <GeronimoGTFU> I'm very fortunate to be working from home. I'm very unfortunate to have @Xfinity as my service provider.   Can I opt-out of this weekly outage feature you guys have rolled out?   Thanks.
1265639011651125249 2020-05-27 09:40:29 EDT <sasspear> @Xfinity what's up with internet outage in Philly area?
1265630373951799296 2020-05-27 09:06:10 EDT <Xfinity> We don't want you upset, let's see what's causing this. Are you finding yourself in an outage or planned maintenance daily?
1265629457227878402 2020-05-27 09:02:31 EDT <longggtime> No outages detected but this happens almost every day.
1265627469903691782 2020-05-27 08:54:37 EDT <kamboutit> I just have an Internet outage like every week...it doesn‚Äôt really work well with those who are working from home.
1265594422055653376 2020-05-27 06:43:18 EDT <Ashutosh_Halbe> @optimum terrible service. In One week of optimum connection  we have experienced more outages than 5 years with xfinity.
1265591985617985537 2020-05-27 06:33:37 EDT <cbetz75> @Xfinity do you know that people are working from home? Having this many outages is ridiculous.
1265560533685743617 2020-05-27 04:28:38 EDT <jazzy_pooh97> Na Xfinity with the shits they need to fix this outage i got class at 10 üôÉ
1265547720355385344 2020-05-27 03:37:43 EDT <Lovickk> The irony of getting an email notifying me my @Xfinity bill is ready just after an outage started
1265544546911477760 2020-05-27 03:25:07 EDT <Missbcarroll> I was in a good ass groove with my orders tonight and bam.. Xfinity planned outage.. üôÑ
1265534571602477057 2020-05-27 02:45:29 EDT <_MythicalWolf> @Xfinity If you aren‚Äôt going to let us choose when you do that useless ‚Äúroutine maintenance‚Äù you should take the entire day of payment off our bill every time because I‚Äôm using the damn internet and always have an outage for ‚Äúroutine maintenance‚Äù as I‚Äôm in the middle of my shit.
1265530125535371264 2020-05-27 02:27:48 EDT <d_Ambrossi> No matter what day or what time I bet if you log into @xfinity there is a service outage in your area. Their product is overpriced for their level of service reliability.
1265529277124096000 2020-05-27 02:24:26 EDT <WahminSC> If I had to work tonight, I'd be pissed.  #xfinity #outage  https://www.instagram.com/p/CArl8lihKul/?igshid=578w0rvxv9ta¬†‚Ä¶
1265528518412247040 2020-05-27 02:21:25 EDT <jakelee_310> Yo @Xfinity, you owe a gulag win since an outage lagged me out of the game.
1265524802435141635 2020-05-27 02:06:39 EDT <i_am_MzTiNa> And then the bogus reason they give is "a technician is performing routine maintenance blah blah blah.." work started 2 min before the outage..Thanks for the damn heads up if thats the case...
1265515750451818496 2020-05-27 01:30:41 EDT <i_am_MzTiNa> @Xfinity wth... come one with this outage...i pay wayyytt too much money for this mess...
1265508837588688898 2020-05-27 01:03:13 EDT <shotsofr0zay> xfinity always having outages and it‚Äôs annoying affff

1265471494538305537 2020-05-26 22:34:50 EDT <RainbowUnicarn> Ok last time I‚Äôm complaining about this but  I can bet that even when I wake up in the morning, xfinity still won‚Äôt have the outage fixed
1265462237109661696 2020-05-26 21:58:03 EDT <WhiskyBravo_7> @Xfinity I haven't had any internet all day. It just says there is an outage in the area. Could I at least be told what is causing the outage?
1265455866876215296 2020-05-26 21:32:44 EDT <m2rtell> Internet service has been on and off for the past couple of days especially today. Is there an outage in Palm Beach County or what?
1265455668712165383 2020-05-26 21:31:57 EDT <RainbowUnicarn> There‚Äôs been an internet outage in my area since NINE HOURS AGO and @Xfinity said that things would be fixed by 7:30. Time has been updated many times to 9:00, 10:00, and now fucking tomorrow. It‚Äôs ridiculous and I honestly feel like nothing is being done about the issue. ._.
1265451778746843138 2020-05-26 21:16:29 EDT <LandNarwal> @Xfinity @comcastcares @comcast Why? Every night around 8pm we get an internet outage in our area that last for 4 freaking hours. We have had you hooked up for 2 weeks and it's worked half the time. This is ridiculous. I have to have the internet in the evenings to do my job.  pic.twitter.com/1DRgUWE3yG
1265449755238232065 2020-05-26 21:08:27 EDT <juansansonjr> @Xfinity how does a whole neighborhood get credit? Outage for 6+ hours now. Upgrade on a weekday? Or outage for other reason? #laceywa @ThurstonCounty @komonews #NoHeadsUp if planned.
1265446370145599488 2020-05-26 20:55:00 EDT <KevinCooney> It wouldn‚Äôt be an evening at the Cooney household without an @Xfinity  service outage. Five in two weeks
1265445044540104704 2020-05-26 20:49:44 EDT <0210Shan> @Xfinity is TRASH! I‚Äôve never seen a company that has an outage 3 times a week. Who do y‚Äôall use for internet?
1265442562858516486 2020-05-26 20:39:52 EDT <_BeautifulKiera> Xfinity with this damn outage üòí

1265424171561037829 2020-05-26 19:26:47 EDT <OkCindi_> So irritated xfinity has an internet outage that is going to last until damn near 11 tonight. üò©

1265421417224400900 2020-05-26 19:15:50 EDT <bethankfulforit> Crazy how it‚Äôs down in other states too.

1265402332851785729 2020-05-26 18:00:00 EDT <Chrispysig> .@comcastcares @Xfinity y‚Äôall really need to figure these outages out. Lost almost an entire day of productivity without service... again- 3rd time this month!!
1265392042856853506 2020-05-26 17:19:07 EDT <Tsalmoth> Spoke to a surprisingly helpful @Xfinity rep. The #watertown and #waltham outage is because of a pole fire combined with their lack of any investment in their infrastructure. So god only knows when things will be back up.
1265386612516630535 2020-05-26 16:57:32 EDT <aubreyluvslucky> I have to deal with trying to finish work from an IPhone so I can‚Äôt message with anyone right now.I was just trying to determine if it was an outage in Watertown Ma or just my house.Luckily someone else replied so I guess I will go with him if Xfinity can‚Äôt tell me.
1265384842201530368 2020-05-26 16:50:30 EDT <aubreyluvslucky> Yes.  I log in to our account and go to the outage area and click on the map and get this error.
1265378021101449216 2020-05-26 16:23:24 EDT <aubreyluvslucky> @Xfinity my internet and cable seem to be down in Watertown, MA but when I try to see if it is just me or an outage I can‚Äôt see the outage map.  I get this error code.  Help! I am logged in to our account.  pic.twitter.com/KHkUbQqj3l
1265377088229511170 2020-05-26 16:19:42 EDT <mikethomas3105> It is not my job to figure out if I have an outage could I have a live person call me please
1265372932026572800 2020-05-26 16:03:11 EDT <TJM88> @comcastcares Hello, looks like internet/phone/cable is down here in #waltham MA. Can you please let me know when you expect this to be back up? Thanks. #comcast #xfinity #outage
1265370864574509056 2020-05-26 15:54:58 EDT <MegaRK9_> Xfinity crapped out on me in the middle of an assignment. Is the #comcastoutage still going on today?? Anyone else in Connecticut experiencing internet outages? Troubleshooting tells me that my ‚ÄúDNS server might be unavailable‚Äù
1265370473753239553 2020-05-26 15:53:25 EDT <itshaleighhh> @lindsaydemeola idk who maxx has for internet but xfinity is having a major outage across the country rn i hope this doesn‚Äôt effect his stream :-(
1265368370515529729 2020-05-26 15:45:03 EDT <dozidozer> Outage in the greater Boston area
1265367580270907393 2020-05-26 15:41:55 EDT <sheistas> Xfinity get it together...these random outages mid work...I gotta send an EMAIL
1265367083166175234 2020-05-26 15:39:56 EDT <kedharrington> @Xfinity @comcast outage in #WalthamMA
1265365226561683456 2020-05-26 15:32:34 EDT <PJAxel17> It does, but it keeps saying that it would be resolved by later in the evening. It's been saying that every day for the last three days. So either it's not completely resolved, or whatever resolution happened didn't work, because I'm seeing outages all over the area.
1265348947058573312 2020-05-26 14:27:52 EDT <PJAxel17> Hey @Xfinity: why have I had to deal with three straight days of sporadic internet and outages all over the north side of Chicago? Hard to do my teaching job when I can't connect!
1265334237466632194 2020-05-26 13:29:25 EDT <Tsalmoth> Huge @Xfinity outage in Watertown that's not going to be resolved until 4:53 (points for precision, I guess), so that's two of us in the house each losing a half day of work. Thanks, Xfinity, and keep jacking up those rates!
1265318425997557760 2020-05-26 12:26:35 EDT <ms_qua> Whew Xfinity is pissing me off with all of these internet outages every other day
1265318139438395392 2020-05-26 12:25:27 EDT <EdTech_Cuadro> Xfinity/Comcast WiFi outage going on in SF. Not a great way to start the workweek. @comcastcares #wfhproblems
1265313745724674049 2020-05-26 12:08:00 EDT <justxfred> @Xfinity my bad...3-6 days...another day, another outage. Can't work from home when this keeps happening. ü§¨ü§¨  https://twitter.com/justxfred/status/1263153970626940934¬†‚Ä¶
1265304227347197952 2020-05-26 11:30:10 EDT <CrazyCreed72> @Xfinity If you you guys would stop having internet outages, that would be great. Thanks. It literally happens every week... ü§£
1265304039790706690 2020-05-26 11:29:25 EDT <JustSnazz> So there is an xfinity outage in our entire area. Welp.
1265294285739614211 2020-05-26 10:50:40 EDT <Bambii_docx> @Xfinity I‚Äôm currently experiencing an outage over an hour and this is very appalling. No email notification was sent prior to this ‚Äúmaintenance‚Äù. Considering majority of us are working from home now, we should have been engaged.

1265294203363475457 2020-05-26 10:50:20 EDT <BMoreDefiant> Comcast/ Xfinity benefits from having a monopoly in Baltimore City. So yes, they should provide something other than intermittent outages at exorbitant prices.
1265293918461198338 2020-05-26 10:49:12 EDT <john_arends> As expected, my @Xfinity outage has now been extended to 1:36 pm without explanation once they got to the initial time. Why give estimates if they just get auto-extended? Been down for hours.
1265288781562855426 2020-05-26 10:28:48 EDT <srk674> @VillageTinleyPk @Xfinity frequent outages of comcast internet. We are having one this time. kids are unable to login into online classes. I'm unable to log into meetings.
1265277700874227714 2020-05-26 09:44:46 EDT <Cris041770> @Xfinity so we have a new time stamp for my service to return 1:06pm almost 24 hrs with no service. I was finally able to talk to two different agents, 1 doesn‚Äôt see any outage so she gave me a serv appt and 2 sees an outage but not sure why. Same system different answers. ü§î
1265268420783857664 2020-05-26 09:07:53 EDT <AnnetteGallagrr> Second major, multi hour outage on a WORKDAY in two weeks. @Xfinity @comcast you have got to better than this right now.
1265252311204532228 2020-05-26 08:03:52 EDT <filthycee> Xfinity still talking bout an outage now I‚Äôm bout to have to work late as hell to make up time whenever my internet come up
1265140588719964162 2020-05-26 00:39:56 EDT <InFlight215> Outage 94541
1265134479451947013 2020-05-26 00:15:39 EDT <moodylilbooty> second outage in a span of 24 hours @Xfinity please get it together
1265126028210401280 2020-05-25 23:42:04 EDT <jodiexyx1> Which zipcode were you? My friends in the same Emeryville neighborhood has been facing the same situation also since yesterdayüò≠üò≠the agents keep saying there is no outage in 94608 @comcast
1265120064920907777 2020-05-25 23:18:22 EDT <MaaaisonH> NBC outage with Xfinity right when @nbctitangames started. I am PISSED!!!!!
1265105317194539013 2020-05-25 22:19:46 EDT <Cris041770> @Xfinity new extended time to 9:16am tomorrow?! I start work from home at 8am! This is annoying! Ridiculous! And no information other than it‚Äôs an outage, no customer reps to speak to, no answers whatsoever! üò°
1265095717372207105 2020-05-25 21:41:38 EDT <LisaMLas> Happy to see the @ComcastILLINOIS repair trucks outside my house fixing downed wires that led to 2-day #Xfinity #outage ‚Äî the last missing piece to being back to normal after this weekend‚Äôs tornado/microburst.  pic.twitter.com/EIL7adUWfM
1265089624780636163 2020-05-25 21:17:25 EDT <teresa> Yup Xfinity has had an outage every day for 3 days in a row now...Working From Home is going to be lots of fun I see.
1265083274776457217 2020-05-25 20:52:11 EDT <SpursTedLasso> I can‚Äôt because @NESpower just loves having rolling outages even when there‚Äôs sunny skies outside.  My @BuschBeer is getting way too hot as well
1265070502541918209 2020-05-25 20:01:26 EDT <MutantLava> Nothing is certain but death, taxes and xfinity internet outages.
1265052525629243403 2020-05-25 18:50:00 EDT <Cris041770> @Xfinity my service is down due to an outage for the past four hours! I keep calling to get an update and every time it gets extended.  I work from home, this is a big inconvenience. Is it another unscheduled maintenance?Last update say service will be back at 9:26pm, seriously?!
1264975993263046659 2020-05-25 13:45:53 EDT <Jaehoyer> @comcast @Xfinity service outages yesterday & today during stay at home order. #Comcast charges exorbitant fees for consistently sub par service. Hope issue is resolved by time I need to login tmrw for work, thinking that is highly doubtful though.
1264973520552906752 2020-05-25 13:36:04 EDT <PalomaCC4> Outages all over the country, what is this about üßê #comcastoutage #outages #whatisreallygoingon #comcast #xfinity
1264952208761782275 2020-05-25 12:11:22 EDT <GratefulTech> On to the next outage. This time  courtesy of @Xfinity.  I‚Äôm guessing this may be related to the @ComEd power outage.  pic.twitter.com/MmsLgzXU3w
1264942245830176773 2020-05-25 11:31:47 EDT <GVLDENDELIGHT> Xfinity getting on my last nerve with these damn outages!! I‚Äôm bout ready to switch back to epbüòí
1264922338837106688 2020-05-25 10:12:41 EDT <RavenDarcel> An internet outage already? Dang Xfinity!! üôÑ
1264915797065060352 2020-05-25 09:46:41 EDT <_prettyassdomo> I‚Äôm seriously thinking about canceling @Xfinity I‚Äôm super cool on these outages every few days
1264762829313388547 2020-05-24 23:38:51 EDT <no_lex_zone> Yo @Xfinity we‚Äôve had 4 outages in the last two weeks, today haven‚Äôt had internet since I got home @ 5... what am i paying for? Please do better.
1264743087957565443 2020-05-24 22:20:24 EDT <Jae_Mieko> Another night. Another @Xfinity outage.
1264734875212566528 2020-05-24 21:47:46 EDT <DaScorpion81> Man this is the worst internet outage I've experienced with @MyCCITweets. As much as I hated @Xfinity's costumer service at least they never went out like this while we were with them. #ConsolidatedCommunications #XFinity #InternetOutage
1264731449095098368 2020-05-24 21:34:09 EDT <dimpledollx> I talked to someone on live chat mine wasn‚Äôt working because they told me in my area there was an outage from our rainstorm we had a day ago and someone was working on it I‚Äôd talk with them on there live chat there service through the phone is crap no one picks up
1264691005464489984 2020-05-24 18:53:27 EDT <Coach_Butler24> Another summer with @Xfinity and @comcast having lengthy outages. I can't wait for my 2 year contract end in June to make the switch to @ATT
1264682955898789888 2020-05-24 18:21:28 EDT <MarloAlexander1> @Xfinity looks like your internet service is down in Albuquerque NM where I live.  I cannot use the chat feature to talk to a rep to see if there is an outage in my area as the map doesn‚Äôt show anything.  I‚Äôve restarted my equipment several times already.
1264655646659575809 2020-05-24 16:32:56 EDT <shelmuth85> @Xfinity Can't watch TBS right now due to a "channel outage." Why not automatically open up TNT to non-subscribers for #TheMatch?
1264640959264043008 2020-05-24 15:34:35 EDT <seantmacd> @comcastcares #xfinity #comcastrophe 48 hr outage. No response from them. I don't know what they care about.  I just know #comcastcares.
1264583267333931008 2020-05-24 11:45:20 EDT <FindMeTN> This outage really been happening for 24hrs. This is ridiculous @Xfinity
1264509629960200192 2020-05-24 06:52:43 EDT <BoobieMerit> @xfinity gotta fix this power outage in Huntsville Alabama or they need to reset my modem because this app don‚Äôt work and I been without internet for longer than 10hrs
1264397813556772864 2020-05-23 23:28:24 EDT <blyisaac> It‚Äôs cool having all your lights controlled by smart home devices until @Xfinity has an outage
1264384777999847424 2020-05-23 22:36:36 EDT <BoobieMerit> Anybody in Huntsville with xfinity internet going thru an outage right now
1264378699165638658 2020-05-23 22:12:27 EDT <blythers> @Xfinity internet went out for HOURS the other night after a short power outage. no was disconnected 5 times while watching an hr show. Roommate/I pay you $130+/month for upgraded package and I can't consistently make my teaching appointments on your network. What can we do?!?!
1264369487240929281 2020-05-23 21:35:51 EDT <cuba_sutra> @comcast @Xfinity  has this ever happened to u?  2 hours after an unsolicited Comcast truck parked on our drive, our internet went out‚Äî24 hours ago!  We can only speak to a machine. The website confirmed the outage & reported restoration by 10pm, 1:30, 6:30, 1:30, 10:30. Given 1/
1264347407208218625 2020-05-23 20:08:06 EDT <MediumGeeseXb1> @Xfinity so internet has been down all day. Then I get a text saying the issue was fixed. So I hop on my Xbox and my internet is out again. Says an unplanned outage is reported. How is that possible if not only 5 minutes ago you fixed it? You guys must be using ubiSoft servers
1264345642249355266 2020-05-23 20:01:06 EDT <Wxgirl169> @Xfinity the cable is out on each of the televisions in my home. I tried to call Xfinity but apparently no one is there to answer. Are you aware of any outages in the Jacksonville Florida area?
1264202083932176384 2020-05-23 10:30:39 EDT <twes_ww> @Xfinity I need help reporting an outage
1264179248216113154 2020-05-23 08:59:54 EDT <blazingtank> Haven't had internet since Monday. Does your Xfinity app show this and tell you there's no outage?  pic.twitter.com/IQCANARSL9
1264155842070351872 2020-05-23 07:26:54 EDT <Blue_100s> I feel the exact same way. I am so sick of having issues with Xfinity it's been going on for the four years that we have had them. @Xfinity your service is so unreliable and way overpriced. I also feel like I pay wayyyyy too much for constant Internet outages. I am fed up
1264053995393302528 2020-05-23 00:42:12 EDT <Nessacery> @Xfinity how to I find out if there‚Äôs an outage in my area? Internet appears to be working, but no cable
1264039290268520457 2020-05-22 23:43:46 EDT <whoinvitedt> xfinity is way too expensive to be having outages more than once a month
1264017930272063488 2020-05-22 22:18:53 EDT <_JolieFilleX> @Xfinity count yo mf days you fat bitch. Y‚Äôall got the most WiFi outages I‚Äôve ever seen.
1264010479212601347 2020-05-22 21:49:17 EDT <hornyratmax> @Xfinity a all day outage seriously
1263996757651927042 2020-05-22 20:54:45 EDT <oteychris> @Xfinity service outage in East Memphis!
1263993092811743232 2020-05-22 20:40:11 EDT <Lt_DanK> @Xfinity why has my internet been out for the last three hours? There are no outages on the map but 500-1000 people have issues in my zip code. Is that not an outage? It‚Äôs been almost 3 hours now and no information about it. I‚Äôve been in hold for 30 minutes after doing a chat.
1263982930646503426 2020-05-22 19:59:48 EDT <StephenxSmith> FYI I‚ÄôM ‚ÄúREPORTING AN OUTAGE IN TUSCALOOSA, AL‚Äù @Xfinity @comcast
1263982675108429824 2020-05-22 19:58:48 EDT <StephenxSmith> Can you PLEASE fix your internet in Tuscaloosa, AL @Xfinity @comcast... it‚Äôs down AGAIN & yet your website says ‚Äúthere has been any outages reported...‚ÄùüôÑü§¨ they better pray that @googlefiber never comes Tuscaloosa b/c I‚Äôll be swapping services the same day, along w everyone else
1263980139282456577 2020-05-22 19:48:43 EDT <snake8head> These random and continuous outages in the Silicon Valley are killing me @Xfinity. What gives?!
1263976438597857280 2020-05-22 19:34:01 EDT <mturetsky> Addendum: Internet is also out. @Xfinity doesn't seem to believe me, because they keep telling me there's no outage, and that I just need to reset my modem, even though I can see the downed cable in the yard.
1263959445345898499 2020-05-22 18:26:29 EDT <Lizthebtsneko> @Xfinity been without a stable internet connection for 5 HOURS it stays on for maybe 20 minutes tops then it‚Äôs back to crashing. What is the problem?? It said earlier we had an outage but now it doesn‚Äôt yet it‚Äôs STILL happening! Please fix this!!
1263931423804751873 2020-05-22 16:35:08 EDT <RealMarkHazzard> Oh, look...another @Xfinity service outage.  pic.twitter.com/0iZFAfSiOL

1263899635367673857 2020-05-22 14:28:49 EDT <TurboColt> Come-on @Xfinity This is the second outage today!!! Was with ATT for a year and NEVER had an outage... #NotReliable
1263892037381885952 2020-05-22 13:58:38 EDT <brewj036> Hey @Xfinity your site should have a ‚Äúreport outage‚Äù link on it. I don‚Äôt care to see a map. I just want to report an outage.
1263883787961864192 2020-05-22 13:25:51 EDT <Xfinity> Let's see how we can help with your bill due to these outages. Send us a DM here:  https://xfin.tv/support¬† üëà
1263882896588312576 2020-05-22 13:22:19 EDT <dansapienza> So I can plan my day around the outages?
1263882399613702144 2020-05-22 13:20:20 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Dan. Download the Xfinity My Account app to stay updated with information on outages, steps to troubleshoot your connection and more. This way you can plan your day accordingly. We do apologize for any inconvenience.
1263856864363720706 2020-05-22 11:38:52 EDT <VGlencoe> Some Glencoe households are currently experiencing Comcast/Xfinity issues. The Village is working with Comcast to get more information on the outage and estimated timeframe for repairs.  pic.twitter.com/l39cTxTJ4r
1263843289397997568 2020-05-22 10:44:55 EDT <azizullahq> Hey @Xfinity - what's going on? Cant decide whether its #outage or not with conflicting messages.. By when can we expect this to get fixed??  pic.twitter.com/WUM23htZzV
1263836274949083136 2020-05-22 10:17:03 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked your My Account app to see if there's an outage reported in your area?
1263807351364161536 2020-05-22 08:22:07 EDT <Xfinity> Hey. Sorry for any frustration. Have you checked your My Account app to see if there's an outage in your area?
1263716115588493312 2020-05-22 02:19:35 EDT <_Chaselol_> Yo @Xfinity y'all gotta chill with these outages every night.
1263696984814292992 2020-05-22 01:03:34 EDT <KirbyApprentice> Happens to me pretty often, every time it happens I check the outage maps and they say something about maintenance interrupting service between certain hours. But instead of going it like 2-5am to stay out of peoples hair they do it around 11-2 when people are still awake
1263683678846291970 2020-05-22 00:10:41 EDT <schig99> @comcast @Xfinity you suck! Outages off & on all day. But yesterday was fine so whatever u did yesterday, just do that. If @ATT didn‚Äôt suck more than u i would switch!!!
1263650271965728768 2020-05-21 21:57:56 EDT <Paulyboi0804> Literally every time I do this all that happens is that someone tells me ‚Äúthere‚Äôs an outage‚Äù like what good does that do me when I‚Äôm still getting charged FULL PRICE WHEN THE SERVICE IS LITERALLY NOT BEING PROVIDED. It‚Äôs literally stealing. But thanks for this automated tweet.
1263640910786637824 2020-05-21 21:20:45 EDT <Paulyboi0804> @Xfinity You have the absolute most unreliable service for internet and cable. I get that‚Äôs there‚Äôs a pandemic going on but I AM PAYING FULL PRICE FOR OUTAGES ALMOST EVERYDAY. Like this is simply unacceptable.
1263636402656423938 2020-05-21 21:02:50 EDT <Topdawgxd> Hey @Xfinity thanks for having an outage during a $200,000 Charity Tournament  when I‚Äôm required to pay a stupid ass amount for service every month...
1263622253322932225 2020-05-21 20:06:36 EDT <Mickcollins32> The second @comcast @Xfinity outage this month. Really? Really?
1263620663316807682 2020-05-21 20:00:17 EDT <on_dre_uh_33> I hope xfinity comping the bill for this outage
1263585224706809856 2020-05-21 17:39:28 EDT <Xfinity> Does it say there is an outage? Can you confirm where you are seeing this info?
1263583264507195392 2020-05-21 17:31:41 EDT <jennielynn35> No, my computer is not working without internet . I am only able to use cell phone. Any idea how long the outage is going to last for Orlando and surrounding area?
1263576239740088320 2020-05-21 17:03:46 EDT <paulbux> Nothing like a good old fashioned @Xfinity outage during working hours when so many need to be online
1263568791138533378 2020-05-21 16:34:10 EDT <MikeWinPost> @Xfinity currently experiencing an outage in Seattle
1263553521246277632 2020-05-21 15:33:29 EDT <hotdaddywags> Dear @Xfinity my internet service has been terrible for weeks. I just waited for an hour for someone to call me back. The connection was garbled (perhaps he was using your digital voice product). His accent was also nearly impossible to decipher. He said I had an outage...
1263543580989276162 2020-05-21 14:53:59 EDT <_smileyriley10> There would be a xfinity outage on my day off üôÑ
1263538838112264192 2020-05-21 14:35:09 EDT <jmtpi> No outage. Internet just drops multiple times per hour, all day.
1263535282256662528 2020-05-21 14:21:01 EDT <HHotelConsult> .@comcast @Xfinity We've never experienced this, and IT says it's not our network, but are you experiencing micro-outages in Marin? It's not my brand new router. Anyone experiencing outages of 1-2 minutes, and would those even register as outages?
1263527040113836037 2020-05-21 13:48:16 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Laney. Have you checked your My Account app to see if you're in an area outage?
1263526283033686016 2020-05-21 13:45:15 EDT <WisrPredecessor> @comcastcares @Xfinity i just have to say one of your employees has literally helped me so much, during this outage in my area.  The person‚Äôs name is, Metz.  Give that man a raise.
1263522186142404610 2020-05-21 13:28:58 EDT <LeeMarieRN> @Xfinity is literally the worst. I pay over $150 every month just for my wifi to consistently not work. We‚Äôve had a wifi outage in my area since this 9:50 am this morning. Some of us actually use wifi to do our jobs. So maybe you could do yours and improve your service.
1263521334778191872 2020-05-21 13:25:35 EDT <ElleYoffee> @comcast and @Xfinity your service is poor and your customer service is nonexistent. you incur an outage on a weekday morning when many of us are working at home with no other choice for internet. current service is spotty at best during this time. just, wow. so disappointing.
1263514476411858944 2020-05-21 12:58:20 EDT <ConnieeeR> Internet outage courtesy of @Xfinity. Guess I‚Äôm done working for today. But I‚Äôll need it back up & running by the time my shows come on. K thx!
1263513550087237641 2020-05-21 12:54:39 EDT <Xfinity> We understand your frustration. We can help with your bill due to this outage. Send us a DM here:  https://xfin.tv/support¬† üëà
1263512364042915841 2020-05-21 12:49:57 EDT <Xfinity> Hey. We're here for you, Dionne. Have you checked your My Account app to see if there's an outage reported in your area?
1263511273607770114 2020-05-21 12:45:37 EDT <Xfinity> We know staying connected is important, are you seeing an estimated time for this outage in your My Account app?
1263508278920839169 2020-05-21 12:33:43 EDT <_breezyjade> totally cool that there‚Äôs an xfinity outage in my area the day I‚Äôm trying to get hella work stuff done before I‚Äôm off for a week. SO lucky that I was chosen as one of the 1-50 people included in the outage!!!! üôÉ
1263507793635692545 2020-05-21 12:31:47 EDT <Xfinity> We can take a look. Are you in an area outage currently or seeing any area issues showing in your My Account app?
1263504152493260801 2020-05-21 12:17:19 EDT <karenn_tran> Is there really an outage in my neighborhood less than 2 hours before my brother‚Äôs AP World exam? This is actually so unnecessary for him to scramble right now where to go for wifi  @Xfinity
1263503241893068800 2020-05-21 12:13:42 EDT <jhulud> @comcastcares @Xfinity Why is there an outage in our area suddenly but nothing saying so in the app?!?! Service has been awful the past few days & today has reached frustrating levels. Now can‚Äôt work from home & the kids can‚Äôt do their online learning. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1263498998859665409 2020-05-21 11:56:50 EDT <JMoCFO> WTF @comcast @Xfinity , you know we‚Äôre working from home right!?!?!? FIX THE OUTAGE!!!!!!!
1263496057104801792 2020-05-21 11:45:09 EDT <_JaneyLaney> I love att but it's just that this happened. Other than that I haven't had too many home internet issues with them. When I had to get xfinity...THAT WAS TERRIBLE . Like terrible service and customer service , and outages were daily
1263479723306475521 2020-05-21 10:40:15 EDT <jhulud> @comcastcares @Xfinity Why is there an outage in our area suddenly but nothing saying so in the app?!?! Service has been awful the past few days & today has reached frustrating levels. Now can‚Äôt work from home & the kids can‚Äôt do their online learning.
1263476304709648387 2020-05-21 10:26:39 EDT <njcarlos> I experience outages on a daily basis
1263454962983620608 2020-05-21 09:01:51 EDT <_AWKN> Two outages nearby, but my internet still isn‚Äôt working.   So that doesn‚Äôt help me.
1263453911949729792 2020-05-21 08:57:41 EDT <_AWKN> Since Florida was essentially an entire outage, yes.  Now my modem isn‚Äôt working properly, or the outage is still affecting my area
1263447797824716800 2020-05-21 08:33:23 EDT <Xfinity> Hi John. Are you in an area outage?
1263447456856961024 2020-05-21 08:32:02 EDT <adhitadselvaraj> This xfinity outage is on till 6am. Damn. They probably thought 12am-6am on a Thursday would be a good time to do a scheduled maintenance üòÇ
1263431107783135234 2020-05-21 07:27:04 EDT <TheFerron> @comcastcares Is @comcast experiencing a nationwide outage with @Xfinity? Internet/phone/TV down in Indianapolis since 1AM ET. #comcastoutage pic.twitter.com/6zAWYEW9Ph
1263429714149957632 2020-05-21 07:21:31 EDT <_LovelyDreamer> I am so fucking over Xfinity and these damn outages that they give us no damn notification for.
1263343840834060288 2020-05-21 01:40:18 EDT <_Kris256> Xfinity and these mf outages gonna have to see me.
1263337890639159299 2020-05-21 01:16:39 EDT <DancinWitDub> @Xfinity AGAIN WITH AN OUTAGE?! This is the THIRD TIME IN A WEEK?! What is really going on?
1263336459706273794 2020-05-21 01:10:58 EDT <planetsmirth> Feeling your pain. This outage is not helping my deadline. How about you notify us before you turn off the internet @comcast. The best part was seeing the outage info on my computer (using my phone as a hot spot) while an @xfinity ad on TV said how they are keeping us connected!  https://twitter.com/dnice1101/status/1263330512552239104¬†‚Ä¶
1263335772616380416 2020-05-21 01:08:14 EDT <NCThacker> Xfinity has a power outage like twice a month now. I‚Äôm so over it. It‚Äôs not even storming.
1263332794505334785 2020-05-21 00:56:24 EDT <Ststressful> Always an outage with this fucking company can‚Äôt stream or even watch my paid streaming services damn @Xfinity trying to stay loyal but I have nothing but problems still not getting the speeds I‚Äôm paying for either ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1263327930475741194 2020-05-21 00:37:04 EDT <demivash> Sorry the stream dropped mid Warzone match, apparently Xfinity is doing a 6 hour long maintenance outage right now and they gave me absolutely zero warning! Hopefully @Mon5taa , Sloth and I can get a 7sins W next time!
1263317075122106374 2020-05-20 23:53:56 EDT <the786official> I had outages when I had xfinity too
1263315017622908928 2020-05-20 23:45:46 EDT <Mad_Dad2020> Xfinity spikes my drink and takes my money while I sleep but we never have outages.  https://twitter.com/the786official/status/1263299727493402625¬†‚Ä¶
1263313279759159297 2020-05-20 23:38:51 EDT <ecoffey> Weird. Have had a partial outage here since Monday
1263313079653134336 2020-05-20 23:38:04 EDT <thesassyserver> @Xfinity is there an outage at 80011??
1263300579239092224 2020-05-20 22:48:23 EDT <ReddHeadBaddie_> My shit always fckn up though. It ain‚Äôt even like there are too many things streaming. It just goes down, no outages in the area no nothin
1263291229392924678 2020-05-20 22:11:14 EDT <notsunil> If I wore a watch, I could set it to these @Xfinity outages the past 3 days  pic.twitter.com/McJwHeRSnc
1263291089160671233 2020-05-20 22:10:41 EDT <Spot79> @ATT @ATTHelp  I know why you don‚Äôt see the internet outage...you must have @Xfinity for your internet. #DoBetter #WhatAmIPayingFor
1263286588580286469 2020-05-20 21:52:48 EDT <amcl23456> Hey @Xfinity @comcastcares , it is way past 6;10 PM, maybe update outage info?!? An XFINITY Services outage has been reported in your area. We're working hard to get your service up and running.The issue will be resolved 05/21/2020 06:10 PM (Eastern).Thank you for your patience.
1263285686410584064 2020-05-20 21:49:13 EDT <LaKaylaB7> honestly at this point, @Xfinity owe ME for all of the outages i have üôÑ
1263276285708681217 2020-05-20 21:11:51 EDT <decodethespin> 24 hrs to fix an outage including telephone.  Sounds like a FCC violation to me. Wont even let you talk to a rep in Florida @Xfinity @comcast @FCC
1263263863228764162 2020-05-20 20:22:29 EDT <Bonnerama> Still down, provider is @Xfinity #outage in #Florida https://twitter.com/outagedetect/status/1263258477960585222¬†‚Ä¶
1263262673443213312 2020-05-20 20:17:46 EDT <Bonnerama> @Xfinity @comcastcares Internet #outage since 3p.  XFi cellular slow as Christmas and no connection to XFi hotspot either. Status - up again at 6pm tomorrow!???  So much for going all-in with #xfinity
1263258649813803010 2020-05-20 20:01:46 EDT <Jack_McCloud> Man... I'm getting sick of my @Xfinity Internet Outages lately. Not because I need internet, but because it takes nearly 10 minutes for Animal Crossing: New Horizons to boot up offline.   Seriously, what in the actual hell??? Why is this amazing game plagued by awful design???
1263258441356906496 2020-05-20 20:00:57 EDT <MyRemyMartin> What the hell is going on with @Xfinity? 4th outage in 1 1/2 weeks. I can‚Äôt watch anything on cable, my internet is out which affects my doorbell system and my security system. He‚Äôll I think I just lost 25 mins worth of progress on my mortal kombat game.  pic.twitter.com/2FcFT9BN7K
1263252779402919941 2020-05-20 19:38:27 EDT <Pistol_Pete16> Yes, that there is an outage in my area. Been saying the same thing since 3.
1263248775637798913 2020-05-20 19:22:32 EDT <jennbirkin> @Xfinity I work from home and need to know when will the outage be fixed?!?
1263243893266698242 2020-05-20 19:03:08 EDT <Jumpahhh> Xfinity has an internet and TV outage right now are thes mfs asking us to go outside or something?
1263233922046898177 2020-05-20 18:23:31 EDT <nkellenicki> @Xfinity Internet down in Hayes Valley SF. Restarted modem and now orange light keeps flashing. App says possible outage.  pic.twitter.com/mLUVfIO7fF
1263231983100014592 2020-05-20 18:15:49 EDT <LizaPotts> Time for our twice monthly @WOWCare internet outage for the entire neighborhood. @Xfinity save us!
1263229823952064512 2020-05-20 18:07:14 EDT <Jumpahhh> Quarantined and Xfinity internet outage this shit is a damn movie
1263227784014462979 2020-05-20 17:59:08 EDT <CMoney2367> Great, now Xfinity wants to have a fucking outage at the end of the day üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§

1263204947522252802 2020-05-20 16:28:23 EDT <alex_ruiz42> There was nothing y‚Äôall could do y‚Äôall had an outage abd your servers went down
1263193396144934912 2020-05-20 15:42:29 EDT <Xfinity> We know this is frustrating, are you in an area outage?
1263190626327126017 2020-05-20 15:31:28 EDT <GSDunno> I just love how it's always my modem that's the issue even though I've restarted it 5 times and Crimecast can't even load their outage map on 4g lte data when my internet goes down. @Xfinity It is not MY fault!
1263188513874419719 2020-05-20 15:23:05 EDT <CouponChica1> I will monitor it. It said my street was fine but nearby in same zip code there was an outage.
1263182451351982080 2020-05-20 14:58:59 EDT <aday17> Alrighty @Xfinity - outages in our area the last several days. Hopefully you're going to do something about it and maybe more than your current temporary fix since it's not quite working?
1263182186490011654 2020-05-20 14:57:56 EDT <master_lallers> There‚Äôs been an outage since 11AM and the app said everything will be fixed at 3:01PM
1263179894718189570 2020-05-20 14:48:50 EDT <AnnaWriteNow> @Xfinity how do we talk with an actual person related to an outage due to a wire being cut outside of our house? We have gone through the automated system and were supposed to receive a phone call, but sadly that has not occurred.
1263175504565342209 2020-05-20 14:31:23 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Eric. Check the Xfintiy My Account app for outage information.
1263175386567004161 2020-05-20 14:30:55 EDT <elephanteric> @Xfinity any world on internet outage in Falmouth, MA?
1263172924955123715 2020-05-20 14:21:08 EDT <Xfinity> Hi! If you're in an area outage, keep an eye on your My Account app for updates. If not, use this link -  https://xfin.tv/support¬† - to DM us.
1263165435295551490 2020-05-20 13:51:22 EDT <markymarc__> Xfinity would have an outage now
1263163014838132737 2020-05-20 13:41:45 EDT <Xfinity> Hi. Are you in an area outage?
1263158337442480128 2020-05-20 13:23:10 EDT <j_molt> @Xfinity #seattle WiFi has been terrible during quarantine. Consistently losing connection due to network outages.

1263132797218291713 2020-05-20 11:41:41 EDT <erinonsnow> @Xfinity another 5 hour scheduled maintenance outage and zero communication to customers before we lose connectivity is unacceptable. I know these are unprecedented times with massive surges in demand but I have confidence you could do better.
1263125252009271296 2020-05-20 11:11:42 EDT <Tiffanyssecret> @Xfinity why‚Äôs there an internet outage in the 30349 area? Since y‚Äôall won‚Äôt put me on the phone with anyone?

1262855917160353792 2020-05-19 17:21:28 EDT <KevyinNashville> @Xfinity I'm sick of our internet going out every day 4 several hours 4 the last month or more. Not just me. Many neighbors n my complex are experiencing the same. Spoken w techs, chat, been on hold, it's ridiculous. Your site never shows an outage. I see a tech here often. HELP

1262805682979581958 2020-05-19 14:01:51 EDT <Xfinity> Outages can definitely be frustrating. Do you have the Xfinity My Account app so you can keep track on restoration times?

1262797919251464193 2020-05-19 13:31:00 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Christina. Are you in an area outage?
1262793138541932546 2020-05-19 13:12:00 EDT <BrianWalz> It's cool; you're reporting outages nowüíÄ
1262791399080157184 2020-05-19 13:05:05 EDT <K_Phil_Lips> 1. Can‚Äôt even get to my account  2. There is no outage in the area 3. The text/ automated system specifically says my modem is offline 4. I‚Äôve already connected and disconnected multiple times
1262790635624501249 2020-05-19 13:02:03 EDT <Xfinity> Let's see what's going on. Are you in an area outage?
1262788816395436035 2020-05-19 12:54:49 EDT <BrianWalz> 1st time today, but had intermittent issues last 4 weekdays. Issues Th/Fr (outages), worked great over the weekend, but Monday morning it died (outages), worked fine in the evening, and then died this morning (after recently completed upgrades!).
1262779095542386688 2020-05-19 12:16:12 EDT <Katie_Bug211> hey @Xfinity I fixed the status message for you. #xfinity #outage #connectionissues pic.twitter.com/ckf92uvabs
1262775628815912967 2020-05-19 12:02:25 EDT <jaydee_ell> Your site refuses to acknowledge an outage in my area. Your chat person told me everything should be fine and I can ‚Äúenjoy my service‚Äù and the number I called told me to do a manual restart (that I‚Äôve done 4 times) and hung up on me. How do I talk to a person?
1262772823971565569 2020-05-19 11:51:17 EDT <jaydee_ell> Annnd my internet is out. Again. @xfinity is a mess lately! So many outages.
1262770419960086528 2020-05-19 11:41:43 EDT <SparkSeekerrr> Okay, @comcast @Xfinity This is the 2 week with a major outage in my area. It‚Äôs been a couple of hours now- Your maps are saying it‚Äôs been resolved, but it‚Äôs NOT! I have too much work and too many kids at home to NOT have service and pay your absorbent MRC.
1262769863438807040 2020-05-19 11:39:31 EDT <Xfinity> We know this is frustrating. Are you in an area outage?
1262762483627913220 2020-05-19 11:10:11 EDT <ChiTownSam723> Yes. I spoke with customer service, who confirmed no area outage and it‚Äôs a problem with my modem, so they‚Äôre resetting. There is no doubt the online rep did that on purpose.
1262761023225778177 2020-05-19 11:04:23 EDT <blazingtank> @Xfinity is there an outage in Houston? Kinda in the dark since your app says there isn't and there's no other option for troubleshooting. I've already manually reset my router twice.
1262748329080844288 2020-05-19 10:13:57 EDT <Xfinity> Hi there. Have you checked your My Account app to see if there is an outage reported?
1262746860751474691 2020-05-19 10:08:06 EDT <byjad> Experiencing an Internet outage with Xfinity is frustrating, to say the least.   If an outage occurs, Xfinity fails to notify you of the outage until some time later.
1262742068348301312 2020-05-19 09:49:04 EDT <CTiz27> Is there an @Xfinity outage in the Atlanta area??
1262734571382210560 2020-05-19 09:19:16 EDT <it_mittens> Who the fuck performs maintenance, causing an area wide outage, at 9am on a work day during a pandemic? That is NIGHT WORK. Fuck @Xfinity and @comcast. üò§
1262732989735358464 2020-05-19 09:12:59 EDT <alyssadunbar17> @comcastcares @Xfinity I know you guys are busy trying to make sure everyone has internet, but we‚Äôre in the middle of our third internet outage in 8 days. This is getting ridiculous.
1262713329501569024 2020-05-19 07:54:52 EDT <skyenpjsmom> @Xfinity is there an outage in Indiana can‚Äôt even access the app?
1262712608123162624 2020-05-19 07:52:00 EDT <TafloraT> @Xfinity always hollering it‚Äôs a outage every time they service mess up which is like every damn day üò§ I knew we should‚Äôve got @ATT
1262710646879256578 2020-05-19 07:44:12 EDT <pennvideo> ! From all reports, #PVN CATV service has been steady since recovering from a brief outage on Friday, 5/15. We continue to encourage usage of XFINITY on Campus streaming for its more robust options.
1262692458963652610 2020-05-19 06:31:56 EDT <Sam_I_Am320> @Xfinity wow, ANOTHER outage? What‚Äôs goin on with y‚Äôall ??
1262637193379577856 2020-05-19 02:52:20 EDT <comcastcares> Hi, if one or more of your Xfinity services isn‚Äôt working, you can check to see if a service outage has been reported in your area a few different ways: through the Xfintiy MyAccount app or  https://comca.st/3bLj4L8¬†.

1262604424431562753 2020-05-19 00:42:07 EDT <VarOOmVarOOmm> My internet and cable are suffering intermittent outages. I hate to sound super #firstworldproblems but I AM LOSING MY SHIT and I don‚Äôt want to call @Xfinity because doing so is also the most painful thing ever and I am assuming exorbitantly so in a pandemic.

1262565612414554114 2020-05-18 22:07:53 EDT <NiedsG> When you have an @Xfinity outage you're required to log on through the internet which doesn't actually work and test the system which doesn't actually work because you don't have fucking internet service
1262562017161994240 2020-05-18 21:53:36 EDT <katie76658144> Will you pay me back for the PTO I was forced to use during your 5 day outage and counting? @comcastcares @Xfinity #comcastoutage #comcast #xfinity

1262504091042758657 2020-05-18 18:03:26 EDT <click_clack31> @Xfinity 3 consecutive weekdays with outages in 98027. Any idea what‚Äôs going on here?  pic.twitter.com/fvQKcoRagU
1262497435756056577 2020-05-18 17:36:59 EDT <Jeff92126163> No, it is not currently showing outages or service interruptions.
1262473451740241922 2020-05-18 16:01:41 EDT <Xfinity> Hi. You can check the My Account app for any outages in your area. If you don't have the My Account app you can access it here:  https://comca.st/2zKYbTc¬†.
1262470016840187904 2020-05-18 15:48:02 EDT <caution1181> @Xfinity is there outage at 33068
1262461176103010308 2020-05-18 15:12:54 EDT <EvynJymes> @Xfinity With this latest outage, you‚Äôve just lost a customer. #outage
1262441847579795456 2020-05-18 13:56:06 EDT <smallfry9> Please do. I am not in an outage area. This isn‚Äôt the first time it‚Äôs randomly gone out. My router is only a year old.
1262439232074891264 2020-05-18 13:45:42 EDT <Xfinity> We can look into this. Are you in an area outage?
1262438644700401664 2020-05-18 13:43:22 EDT <lindZdanielle22> @Xfinity outage in Downtown Miami and learned it won‚Äôt be fixed until 3 PM :(
1262426680712474626 2020-05-18 12:55:50 EDT <Xfinity> We can take a look. Are you seeing any outage information showing in your My Account app?
1262424539654500353 2020-05-18 12:47:19 EDT <_tajaa_> Xfinity outage in my area.... just sent my boss the screenshot ü§£‚úåüèæ
1262406797601767428 2020-05-18 11:36:49 EDT <illneverlogoff> @Xfinity two days in a row of internet outages... what is going on?
1262393832001409026 2020-05-18 10:45:18 EDT <PaigeHolland69> FYI- if you live in Tupelo & your Xfinity cable/Internet just went off: "An XFINITY Services outage has been reported in your area. We're working hard to get your service up and running. The issue will be resolved 05/18/2020 01:40 PM (Central). Thank you for your patience."
1262383083984236546 2020-05-18 10:02:35 EDT <PetersonDave> No, it‚Äôs still out. It‚Äôs now day 5 of the outage. Still no ETA. Note that everyone I‚Äôve talked to in my area never lost service.
1262380388984512515 2020-05-18 09:51:53 EDT <mlattanze1199> @xfinity what's up with all these outages??? I have class starting soon that I CAN'T miss it
1262378967572582401 2020-05-18 09:46:14 EDT <Rhon_Stoppable> No outages. Pretty sure it‚Äôs a shortage in one of the cords. It‚Äôs been going in and out for weeks. But the duration of the outages have been getting longer. We had no service for two whole days last week
1262374454635741185 2020-05-18 09:28:18 EDT <Xfinity> We know this is frustrating, are you in an area outage currently?
1262374094718337024 2020-05-18 09:26:52 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Patrice. If you're in an area outage, keep an eye on your My Account app for updates.
1262372349564850179 2020-05-18 09:19:56 EDT <_KianaChante> Xfinity outage which means no work today. I am grateful üòÇ.
1262366388703854596 2020-05-18 08:56:15 EDT <kimleonard> Yes - it says there is an outage in my area.
1262365685235228676 2020-05-18 08:53:27 EDT <Xfinity> Hi! Apologies for the interruption. Is there info on your My Account app in regards to the outage?
1262364424389775362 2020-05-18 08:48:27 EDT <evirginia30> @Xfinity does not care for their customers. Its monday morning and I can‚Äôt work because the wifi in my area is not working. There seems to be an outage every other day in my area. Unbelievable!
1262281253870620672 2020-05-18 03:17:57 EDT <itsjustgwyneth> @Xfinity @comcastcares outage for 3 hours now??????? i have stuff to do man

1262255087126274054 2020-05-18 01:33:58 EDT <muto0517> @Xfinity 6th outage this weekend in Chicago area (60613), and still not fixed. This isn‚Äôt a joke, right?!!
1262234555584479234 2020-05-18 00:12:23 EDT <g21821290> @comcastcares why xfinity down AGAIN. There an outage?
1262205046072020992 2020-05-17 22:15:08 EDT <Mr_MIH> @Xfinity internet has been crap over the past few days...I don‚Äôt recall signing up for outages every day
1262157179324436481 2020-05-17 19:04:55 EDT <lindafo7493> GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER @Xfinity/@comcast  *OUTAGES REPORTED - We're working quickly to restore this issue* -- This has happened WAY TOO DAMN OFTEN, at least once a day for at least a week! It's getting effing ridiculous when we try to change the channel and can't!
1262137061890387970 2020-05-17 17:44:59 EDT <Fist_of_Cuervo> @Xfinity my internet connection keeps going out, and I've restarted my modem twice now. According to the Xfinity app, there are no reported outages in my area either so I'm unsure as to how my internet is losing connection.
1262097818220662784 2020-05-17 15:09:03 EDT <Xfinity> Hi, have you checked to see if these outages are part of area-wide service interruptions according to the My Account app?
1262060881283817474 2020-05-17 12:42:16 EDT <CanesSwag954> @Xfinity how y‚Äôall got an outage on a fucking Sunday
1262033970784546827 2020-05-17 10:55:20 EDT <PetersonDave> No internet since 1 pm on Thursday. Xfinity app says 2500+ affected in 32082. We‚Äôre the only house in our neighborhood without access. No ETA. Since it‚Äôs a reported outage, Comcast refuses to send a technician. Unbelievable. @comcast @Xfinity #comcastoutage #xfinityoutage
1262028756455170049 2020-05-17 10:34:37 EDT <jcgiles> Anybody else having problems with their @Xfinity WiFi? It says no outage in my area and that everything is online but havent been able to get online all morning
1262025825303629825 2020-05-17 10:22:58 EDT <VoiceOvBrian> Hey @Xfinity @comcast these daily outages are unacceptable. Especially now. You weren't  prepared for this usage case because you have only been providing a minimum viable product. Now it's failing. Make it right with your customers. Be the essential service that we need.
1262014435134234631 2020-05-17 09:37:43 EDT <ajpolesel> @Xfinity why do we pay a full months worth of internet and tv and never actually get a full month of service? We have had outages everyday on and off. This has been going on for months now. Come on
1261873364475564033 2020-05-17 00:17:09 EDT <niyvmira> First a block wide power outage, bow the xfinity wifi down
1261851101168574465 2020-05-16 22:48:41 EDT <twisted_mental> @Xfinity is there an outage in Fayetteville GA?
1261806825801998338 2020-05-16 19:52:45 EDT <Table_for_2> Great Job @ATT. Zero working methods to contact technical support when there is an outage outside normal business hours. You're lucky @Xfinity doesn't have symmetrical upload speeds yet or I would drop you even faster!
1261803452788879360 2020-05-16 19:39:20 EDT <SelfmadeC3d> It‚Äôs really a Internet outage in my area. @Xfinity come on, man!!!!
1261800424337793024 2020-05-16 19:27:18 EDT <SelfmadeC3d> Xfinity better get their shit together! Mf‚Äôs talking bout it‚Äôs an outage. Hit the reset button!
1261795083055239168 2020-05-16 19:06:05 EDT <agallan> @Xfinity sucks so bad their automated system hung up on me rather than help me with an outage. @comcast @comcastcares yeah right. #comcastoutage
1261794184001921025 2020-05-16 19:02:31 EDT <_MiaKayeee> I would have an outage in the middle of my movie. @Xfinity , what‚Äôs up? üëÄ
1261774100789260289 2020-05-16 17:42:42 EDT <amrschar> @Xfinity love how your default is "it's your equipment" and then after making me turn it on and off for 20+ minutes it's an outage in the area
1261773587318439936 2020-05-16 17:40:40 EDT <josh_millmore> hey @Xfinity as soon as you fix the outage in my area im cancelling you and signing up for metronet. real catch 22 for ya here huh?
1261773523787190272 2020-05-16 17:40:25 EDT <amrschar> @Xfinity here's a magical idea. Don't tell the problem is with my equipment and then after 20+ minutes of troubleshooting send me a message that it's an outage in the area. #crapsupport
1261765580501090304 2020-05-16 17:08:51 EDT <garyide> Zip 98125 total outage for 2500+ since 4pm Wed. That is now 70 hours with no status update or ETA! @COMCAST asked me to DM for a status, and hasn't replied in 30 hrs. Not good. #xfinityoutage #comcastoutage @Xfinity @comcast

1261687385055789056 2020-05-16 11:58:08 EDT <counselor_erin> @comcastcares @Xfinity I‚Äôm still waiting on a solution to my issue of intermittent internet outages. The reps sending me private messages aren‚Äôt remotely close to giving me a solution. There is not a problem with my modem. I need a call from someone in management.  pic.twitter.com/xyPfkFCtVa
1261655186348654592 2020-05-16 09:50:11 EDT <PLaff08> All I wanted to do is watch the return of the Bundesliga and Xfinity decides now is the time for an outage...
1261638401264103425 2020-05-16 08:43:29 EDT <DaniChris82> So I went to bed at midnight because @Xfinity had an outage in my area. I said, self that‚Äôs a sign go to bed. I wake up and it‚Äôs still out üò©üò©üò© This can‚Äôt be life. @comcast can you provide an ETA por favor?

1261486770853679105 2020-05-15 22:40:58 EDT <kitcomgenesis> @xfinity who was the genius who decided that outage maps should be behind the login?!

1261392627611480065 2020-05-15 16:26:52 EDT <Mielkbone> @Xfinity is there a way to set 2 different outgoing voicemail messages: 1 for normal and 1 for when the phone lines are down? Outage at 80904 today caused phones to b down. we lost business cuz of that, including a rude voicemail left by a customer cuz nobody was able to answer

The cause is because
1261370013094535170 2020-05-15 14:57:00 EDT <Xfinity> First check the Xfinity My Account app to see if there is an outage or planned maintenance happening in your area.
1261369446636990465 2020-05-15 14:54:45 EDT <Dallasn08> @Xfinity we like your internet speeds, but what's with the outages in Chicago the last few days? Makes it difficult to complete our work.

Comast "Xfinity" is such a predatory company because we don't have a lot of choices most locales

1261183429070249984 2020-05-15 02:35:35 EDT <KirbysRoar> @Xfinity How is it that you‚Äôre having an outage at 1:00 in the morning and you just know it‚Äôs going to be resolved by 5:55? If you were going to schedule a shut down a heads up would‚Äôve been less inconvenient. 4 hrs ü§®üò¶ü§¨

Another tech was sent Tuesday and supposedly put in a ticket to have a new line put in. Tonight, after calling in due to outage, we found out no ticket was put in by the tech.
1261098735779618819 2020-05-14 20:59:03 EDT <Siglerjsg> @Xfinity ... Having a 4 minute message from a computer not doing absolutely anything is utterly annoying. The computer is useless...

1260983432236195845 2020-05-14 13:20:52 EDT <Xfinity> Hey Emma. This sounds like planned maintenance in the area or outages are happening. If that's the case your service will be affected on all equipment. Service updates are available through the Xfinity My Account app. DM us to look into crediting your account for any downtime.
1260982139614625795 2020-05-14 13:15:44 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked the My Account app to determine if there are any outages in your area?
1260978976509616129 2020-05-14 13:03:10 EDT <emmafrog94> I am hardwired into the gateway, this is a business connection. I‚Äôve contacted xfinity every single time I‚Äôve had an outage and they always tell me ‚Äúsomeone is working in your area, there may be outages throughout the day‚Äù that‚Äôs multiple times a month for the last few months.
1260978933450764289 2020-05-14 13:03:00 EDT <bloristo> @Xfinity without my personal hotspot from my cell phone provider, I would be screwed working from home with all your outages during peak busy time. losing a customer as soon as I get other quotes.

1260947357497245696 2020-05-14 10:57:31 EDT <ikingmoe> Great to wake up to no internet or tv from @Xfinity @comcastcares @comcast and no text or email about the outage. You do know people are working from home and students need the internet right?
1260947296214306816 2020-05-14 10:57:17 EDT <itsZac12> @Xfinity I‚Äôve had a local outage for a few days. The WiFi cuts in and out every few hours. My next door neighbor is not getting the outages. There are 2,500 people affected. When will this be fixed?

1260790942350663681 2020-05-14 00:35:59 EDT <KnightOfNoise> @Xfinity why would you do scheduled maintenance for 7 hours without notifying your customers? Internet just stopped working, and I had to check for reported outages to find out.

1260725591713763328 2020-05-13 20:16:18 EDT <Xfinity> We know this has been frustrating. We're working to fix this outage ASAP. Is any end time information showing in your My Account app?
1260722087586484224 2020-05-13 20:02:23 EDT <NickFlairr> Xfinity outage in my area, stream will be back up once I have internet again, I‚Äôm not sure when that‚Äôll be!

1260717861720506372 2020-05-13 19:45:35 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked your My Account app to see if you're in an area outage?
1260685161336692736 2020-05-13 17:35:39 EDT <CoachSwingVB> @Xfinity We've had WiFi on Demand for 7 months.  Stopped working on Sunday. On Monday CS says a tech is working on it, 2 hours.  Tuesday CS says maintenance outage,  24 hours. Today CS says there's no hotspot,  check map.  There's hotspot at our exact address!  Ok, we'll buy
1260669504830550022 2020-05-13 16:33:26 EDT <tmreeder21> No I am aware there is an outage, I was asking why. Is there work going on in the area? Why has this been a problem so much in the last week and a half? I pay for my internet to work, and now for 3 days in this billing period, it hasn‚Äôt.
1260668347798089728 2020-05-13 16:28:50 EDT <c_cassion> @Xfinity I get outages happen but this has been a running theme for a few days now where I'll be on a call and it just drops for a few minutes. This isn't the time to be mediocre.
1260663757069402113 2020-05-13 16:10:36 EDT <USeattlite> Internet down again, didn't realize I was paying for 3 hours a day of shitty @CenturyLink service and not the whole day.  The daily outages are old af and I'm calling Comcast/Xfinity right f*cking now  pic.twitter.com/e58lVkp2zI

1260660237352046593 2020-05-13 15:56:37 EDT <tmreeder21> Has there been something going on with @Xfinity internet in Nashville in the last week and a half? We have had 3 separate outages in the last week and a half after having none in a long time. Is there work being done or something @comcast?
1260660056149786624 2020-05-13 15:55:53 EDT <LoDorie> @Xfinity outage in NJ in the middle of working hours. Comon!!!!!!

1260658805827760128 2020-05-13 15:50:55 EDT <Xfinity> Are you in an outage currently?
1260657483242106881 2020-05-13 15:45:40 EDT <_MrsClawson_> When the guy at @comcast  goes ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen anything like this before, I can‚Äôt help you.‚Äù You know you‚Äôre never going to be productive. 5-8 outages a day is really unacceptable. As an educator my students rely on me, this is impacting my ability to do my job. @Xfinity
1260650047839989760 2020-05-13 15:16:07 EDT <breapacific> @Xfinity you are a SHIT SHOW. Been trying to get ahold of someone ALL DAMN DAY. Phone says ‚Äúgo online and chat‚Äù and the chat says ‚Äúunavailable, please call us‚Äù RESTORE MY TV SERVICE ASAP! This is ridiculous no one knows if it‚Äôs an outage or that I have a payment set for Friday.

1260612454763167747 2020-05-13 12:46:44 EDT <MeganKriz28> I just got xfinity last week and I didn‚Äôt have any problems until last night, but then I got notified there was a power outage for a few hours so maybe that‚Äôs happening?
1260611279204556807 2020-05-13 12:42:04 EDT <Morgan_Rachel96> Me: ‚ÄúIm going to be so productive today!‚Äù  .@Xfinity: ‚ÄúNah, we‚Äôre going to have internet outages all day.‚Äù  Me: üôÉüôÉüôÉ #ThanksObama
1260587848526430208 2020-05-13 11:08:58 EDT <Xfinity> Were the outages area-wide according to the My Account app?
1260578957277171718 2020-05-13 10:33:38 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked the My Account app for any service outages in your area?
1260570977022468099 2020-05-13 10:01:55 EDT <Drnksinatra> Waking up Xfinity outages are always great right?
1260531134758354945 2020-05-13 07:23:36 EDT <oddiemidgett> @WSMVHollyT Xfinity just notified us there was an outage in you guys transmission signals

1260463926166290435 2020-05-13 02:56:32 EDT <newberryyyy> Comcast / xfinity is run by a den of thieves... Periodic internet outages are prevalent & never credited. Rates keep going up for the most basic services (San Francisco Bay area). My monthly bill is now  $100 & Comcast is enforcing contracts to ensure the customer are squeezed.
1260463374758002689 2020-05-13 02:54:21 EDT <Pingiwin> @Xfinity like wtf? We have had our internet go off and on and off and on 10 times within 7 minutes. No outages but this service sucks!
1260460582836281356 2020-05-13 02:43:15 EDT <dankcorpse> Fuck you @Xfinity I've had 13 hour long internet outages every day for the past week. Get your shit together. How the fuck are you going to charge me for going over a data plan during a pandemic then not even fucking provide internet. How the fuck am I supposed to work or study??
1260454053307392003 2020-05-13 02:17:19 EDT <irineomedina> Gotta love having shitcast as your internet provider. Get random outages and all they say is to check your cable connections. By the way the troubleshooting on the app is completely useless. #xfinity
1260389999448596482 2020-05-12 22:02:47 EDT <marchingnorth> @comcastcares woke up to an internet outage.  It was fixed but our internet still was out.  Customer service couldn‚Äôt help so I went ahead and got a brand new modem since ours was old.  After spending half an hour on the phone with XFINITY it worked for about 2 hours...
1260385608113041410 2020-05-12 21:45:20 EDT <KalaUnique> It says there‚Äôs a power outage in the area ü•∫
1260382520992030722 2020-05-12 21:33:04 EDT <Necrosis__> weather outside ain‚Äôt even bad but @Xfinity gotta have a outage , fuck y‚Äôall foreal
1260376352890466318 2020-05-12 21:08:33 EDT <AEsenler> Second outage of the day (just a quick one though) @Xfinity #xfinitysaga
1260364486743031809 2020-05-12 20:21:24 EDT <TexasTwon> Really wished @ATT @Xfinity @verizonfios or @googlefiber was available in my area of Fort Worth for businesses. Losing money with this @GetSpectrum outage is horrific, during this pandemic we‚Äôve already lost $5400 in monthly income now these outages with no COMMUNICATION.
1260352552979357696 2020-05-12 19:33:59 EDT <ltaylor_22> @Xfinity why are you sending me a monthly bill for internet charges if you‚Äôre going to have several outages. Every. Single. Day.
1260349833375875075 2020-05-12 19:23:11 EDT <KinnyGames> Outage doesn't show I'm affected, but it's right next to my house and I clearly am. Nothing else has changed about my setup.
1260346168707596293 2020-05-12 19:08:37 EDT <veelloo97> Since late last night, no outages detected in my area but drastic speed decrease
1260343071499325443 2020-05-12 18:56:18 EDT <KinnyGames> I've troubleshooted and troubleshooted. Multiple devices. There are outages all around me that have been going on ALL day. How am I supposed to work from home when I can't do anything.

The app says no outages near us at the same time it says ‚Äúno signal‚Äù - and yes we‚Äôve troubleshooted multiple times  pic.twitter.com/aFJ6dEZYl9
1260322814449639426 2020-05-12 17:35:49 EDT <Xfinity> We know this is frustrating. Are you seeing any completion information for this outage in your My Account app?
1260319140755247104 2020-05-12 17:21:13 EDT <Xfinity> What's going on? Are you in an area outage currently?
1260300908799291393 2020-05-12 16:08:46 EDT <AriKaye3> Really!? I‚Äôm experiencing my second outage of the month, this one during working hours and you say it‚Äôs gonna take all day to fix
1260298684559998977 2020-05-12 15:59:56 EDT <_YaBoiJon_> At least once a month my @Xfinity internet has an outage, for the price they charge youd think they'd have more stable internet  only other ip here is CenturyLink and if you ever had them youd know they're dogshit. I wish @GetSpectrum services my area üôèüèª
1260291246809120769 2020-05-12 15:30:22 EDT <Xfinity> I know that an outage can be very frustrating - especially when we're inside more than usual and rely heavily on our services. Do you have the Xfinity My Account app downloaded? You'll be able to stay updated with the status of the outage so you can plan your time better.
1260290920840339458 2020-05-12 15:29:05 EDT <hnlamb> @Xfinity always an internet outage on my day off when I'm actually home üôÑ

1260290773834018818 2020-05-12 15:28:30 EDT <just_cuzzzzzz> Yeah I get random outages at times sometimes the service will be down in my area for a certain period. It doesn‚Äôt happen to me every night but it only happens around 12am-1am due to maintenance purposes. I just downloaded the xfinity app on my phone to check for outages
1260290181200035840 2020-05-12 15:26:08 EDT <AkenoSucks> Okay I worded this wrong, do any of you have xfinity wifi and experience random outages or times where you shit just goes off for no reason as of lately ?

1260287780879507457 2020-05-12 15:16:36 EDT <Xfinity> How often are you noticing that there's an outage in your area?
1260283990688358401 2020-05-12 15:01:32 EDT <cherryswestmo> When you way too much for @Xfinity but there‚Äôs always an outage! #WFH is not easy and this doesn‚Äôt make it any easier. What service do you have? I need to look elsewhere. pic.twitter.com/tm017eOF2t
1260283293313970179 2020-05-12 14:58:46 EDT <Xfinity> Hi. Are you in an area outage?
1260265393924472838 2020-05-12 13:47:39 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Dave, do you know if you are part of an area wide outage?
1260257446150447109 2020-05-12 13:16:04 EDT <LaBellaMinaj13> Yes the representative and the "outage map" detected a outage. Saturday morning. We talked with othrs through text through the weekend, saying "sorry we can't help they will k.i.t." Then talking to someone yesterday saying "their will be a "scheduled power outage" at 3am 6am

1260250521618853892 2020-05-12 12:48:33 EDT <Xfinity> You stated that you had a power outage which would impact service as you would need power to your modem to use the internet. Is that not the case?
1260249087720513538 2020-05-12 12:42:51 EDT <olemissfan363> @bbb_us Can y‚Äôall help me with this? I still have no internet and Xfinity will not even respond after THEY asked me to message them!

1259995281304756225 2020-05-11 19:54:19 EDT <kevpolitics> Yes but it does not show on the outage map. I thought they cut my neighborhood when I joked and said if T Mobile had 3G I would switch
1259994921106317312 2020-05-11 19:52:53 EDT <Xfinity> Have you been in an area outage during this time?
1259993542610620419 2020-05-11 19:47:24 EDT <Ashh_Ketchum> Yes. There have been area outages for the past week, and there have been two today.
1259992529526759424 2020-05-11 19:43:23 EDT <Xfinity> We know this is frustrating, have you been in area outages?
1259975636791308290 2020-05-11 18:36:15 EDT <Xfinity> We know this has been a frustrating experience. We can look to see what's causing the constant outages in your area. Send us a DM here:  https://xfin.tv/support¬† , so we can help.

1259972953707593738 2020-05-11 18:25:35 EDT <_aaaalyak> Another Outage I Had At Least 7 Since This Month Started
1259965030386348035 2020-05-11 17:54:06 EDT <osartor> He had to do the exam on his phone and has two more exams this week. Your response did not answer key #cx questions. Will we have to deal with more outages? Will you also not notify in advance us again? #fail #morefail
1259960978378293250 2020-05-11 17:38:00 EDT <Theelegend__> @Xfinity is really pissing me off with these outages. I swear my internet stops working at least twice a week!
1259950531801313290 2020-05-11 16:56:30 EDT <kings_casanova> Xfinity has so many outages I should be getting a discount on my service üôÑ
1259943456815882245 2020-05-11 16:28:23 EDT <shai_s> Stupid @Xfinity internet outage in the middle of the day.
1259940465589223426 2020-05-11 16:16:30 EDT <__adamo__> @Xfinity @comcastcares sooooo this is the 3rd day in a row where there‚Äôs Inter outages  pic.twitter.com/Zlc6KHlu5j
1259930691954827266 2020-05-11 15:37:39 EDT <PrecariPolitics> @Xfinity @comcastcares I am experiencing intermittent slowdowns and outages in zip 80218
1259923324043513869 2020-05-11 15:08:23 EDT <rightorbear> @Xfinity are you guys having an outage in Old City Philadelphia? No service on public WiFi for over an hour now.
1259906272997998592 2020-05-11 14:00:38 EDT <Monica_Keo> Of course, xfinity has an outage in my area on the day of my last final. The only timed final I have.... looks like I‚Äôll be testing out the strength of my phone‚Äôs hotspot.
1259904080345878528 2020-05-11 13:51:55 EDT <Xfinity> Is there an area outage reported on the My Account app?

1259873196037324802 2020-05-11 11:49:11 EDT <PoppaPhill> I am not feeling blessed. Judt got off the phone 1st customer supporter agent told me there was an outage. 2nd support tells me there is not an outage & they cannot get a signal to my modem/router. @comcast @Xfinity 2nd time this week I have someone coming out. 6 month problem.
1259855825029541888 2020-05-11 10:40:10 EDT <Xfinity> Is there information in the Xfinity My Account app on planned maintenance or an outage?
1259854277364854784 2020-05-11 10:34:01 EDT <CGEgaming> Bruh my internet is contantly going out... never missed a payment but I spend more time with constant internet interference or/and multiple outages... been calling multiple times a week for months now and only still have them because no @verizonfios available in my area üò†üò†üò°üò°
1259843351731453952 2020-05-11 09:50:36 EDT <kparker2018> @Xfinity @comcastcares Started service with you all last week and have not been able to get in contact with customer service at all. On top of that there has been an outage in my area for the last 2 days and I work from home so I'm losing money. Need info on service restoration!!
1259823320175972352 2020-05-11 08:31:00 EDT <hottshel> It would be nice if this were actually true....my account has shown an outage for internet and tv for the last 4 days, cannot get a hold of anyone and chat/messenger just says its being worked on.....this is not the time for this long of an outage.
1259820849089048576 2020-05-11 08:21:11 EDT <DouglasBrush> I had the same conversation with family on @Xfinity outages. So this week I got rid of @comcast and went to fiber.
1259810844537499648 2020-05-11 07:41:26 EDT <olemissfan363> Our outage got pushed back again and you still can‚Äôt respond to me but y‚Äôall sure made sure to charge me full price for this month this morning. Y‚Äôall have no issues charging but can‚Äôt answer the phone lol
1259734468962603008 2020-05-11 02:37:56 EDT <n_e_x_u_s> .@Xfinity could be transparent and put outage maps in public, rather than hide behind a pay wall / login wall.
1259733476200165377 2020-05-11 02:34:00 EDT <n_e_x_u_s> Xfinity says 98144 affected by outage. ‚ÄúTracking number of the outage is SI042907184‚Äù Out since 5/10 5:20 PM and UP ETA 1:20 AM 5/11.

1259677989010378752 2020-05-10 22:53:30 EDT <ME0WMIX69> hey @Xfinity i don't spend close to $110 every month on just wifi for you to throttle my internet for hours at night. this has been happening for a week now even with "no reported outages" and i'm sick of it.  pic.twitter.com/Ib7295OoPb
1259654713705979906 2020-05-10 21:21:01 EDT <AlBlades_Jr> I‚Äôm tired of @Xfinity having an outage every two weeks. üòî now I just have to sit here
1259654133847597056 2020-05-10 21:18:43 EDT <Xfinity> Are you in an area outage?
1259647972016558080 2020-05-10 20:54:14 EDT <Xfinity> Hey Elizabeth! Are you in an area outage?
1259620763822407680 2020-05-10 19:06:07 EDT <jackbandy> I changed the NTP server on my in-laws‚Äô router this afternoon.  Now there is an xfinity outage in the area, and the apophenia is intense.
1259590201707499522 2020-05-10 17:04:40 EDT <olemissfan363> @comcastcares hello can you help me?? I can‚Äôt get any information out of @Xfinity other than when I called I was told ‚Äúthis outage was caused by god so ask him‚Äù it‚Äôs been a week now. I need someone to please call me or assist in some way.
1259558375525879816 2020-05-10 14:58:12 EDT <Xfinity> Hi there! We're happy to help. Have you checked your My Account app to see if there's an outage in your area?
1259548489928912896 2020-05-10 14:18:55 EDT <gennatay> Thanks. I need something. I can‚Äôt keep having Xfinity outages at the price I‚Äôm paying  pic.twitter.com/WXBwDw9jGE
1259516444792029185 2020-05-10 12:11:35 EDT <__adamo__> @Xfinity love waking up to yet ANOTHER internet outage! It‚Äôs like a daily routine now
1259511549821177856 2020-05-10 11:52:08 EDT <gennatay> @Xfinity is having an outage on Mother‚Äôs Day during a quarantine. No zoom calls for us I guess. üò© #MothersDay @comcastcares
1259501409202065408 2020-05-10 11:11:51 EDT <AEsenler> Just to document it, we are experiencing ANOTHER outage now. #xfinity # Comcast @comcastcares
1259460914299969537 2020-05-10 08:30:56 EDT <lisa_j_duncan> @comcast @Xfinity still no service Comcast.  Your promise of 10 pm last night was wrong.  You are now saying 9:55 am today...why are you lying to your customers? Outage is now on day 6.  How are people supposed to work from home or home school their children?
1259334624867569664 2020-05-10 00:09:06 EDT <runyannicholas> @Xfinity @comcast my service is extremely inconsistent. I have an internet outage once every 30 minutes. I spent 4.5 hours with multiple representatives last night who all didn‚Äôt provide a solution.
1259309329238200320 2020-05-09 22:28:35 EDT <Cd_4573> üòÇüòÇüòÇ I saw it. All Friday Xfinity had an outage in my area so I had no WiFi or tv. Today it was back but I have never seen anything this bad. To top it off Amazon delayed my ethernet cable delivery. Might just have to schedule one of those special appointments.
1259292469025542145 2020-05-09 21:21:35 EDT <cocopita> Second outage in 2 days. Thanks @Xfinity @comcastcares but I have Xfinity mobile @xfinitymobile...yeah right. Same üí© pic.twitter.com/y8VnpRGguh
1259281451968876547 2020-05-09 20:37:49 EDT <CubanGirlNJ> It's bad enough that we're stuck at home @Xfinity @comcastcares BUT adding insult to injury there's been a 4+ hr outage that was supposed to have been resolved by 7:15pm tonight. I noticed your recording now says "as soon as possible." Too many and too frequent outages! #EpicFail
1259268187658412032 2020-05-09 19:45:06 EDT <ftsdeploy> @Xfinity  I need to elevate an issue to a service outage. Your tech team has the inability to resolve and issue in the 84029 zip code. I have spent over 10hrs on the phone in the last 3 days.
1259235577523843073 2020-05-09 17:35:31 EDT <nfoyss> @Xfinity outage in Florida . Whats happening
1259226531060084736 2020-05-09 16:59:34 EDT <victoria17april> @Xfinity why is it that these outages have to occur... not only during quarantine, but FINALS WEEK? What am I supposed to be doing now? Your beloved hotspots don‚Äôt work either. And you can‚Äôt get someone out here for 5 days? A+++++ service
1259198553051869184 2020-05-09 15:08:24 EDT <ItsCranston> @Xfinity I need a whole day took off my bill since y'all have a outage
1259177534710784005 2020-05-09 13:44:53 EDT <__adamo__> ANOTHER #xfinity outage!? Can a girl get a break? Damn üôÑ I‚Äôm just trying to watch houseviwes
1259174792365817857 2020-05-09 13:33:59 EDT <d_northcutt> @comcastcares Comcast outages in 37076 since 5/3. I‚Äôve ‚Äúchatted‚Äù w/ Comcast/Xfinity 4 times and given 4 restoration times. Nothing. Chatters don‚Äôt know the situation and pick random times - 4:41 am, 5:37 pm. Comcast is the only means of news and weather for many. Frustrated!
1259129797755703296 2020-05-09 10:35:11 EDT <Rezumay> Love waking up to WiFi outage @Xfinity
1259104037150035969 2020-05-09 08:52:50 EDT <ericsmalling> That sucks!  I had 3 similar AT&T outages last year due to fiber cuts near my neighborhood.  I'm considering a  https://unifi-lte.ui.com/¬† as insurance but really would like it if @ubnt made a carrier-unlocked version so I could use it on @TMobile.
1259103432151044096 2020-05-09 08:50:25 EDT <olemissfan363> Our outage was pushed back AGAIN with no information, you have still yet to respond to the DM that YOU requested yesterday, can someone please respond? This is beyond frustrating and the worst customer service I‚Äôve ever seen. We have no internet and no one can even respond.
1259003775680778241 2020-05-09 02:14:25 EDT <KurtGoKrazy> Pls tell me there isn't an Xfinity outage rn
1258946157851693058 2020-05-08 22:25:28 EDT <jackleon> hey @Xfinity - i tried to report an outage on my internet through through your automated xfinity assistant and it told me that no outage was reported in my area... but i have no internet signal and my router has been reset.
1258909722553602050 2020-05-08 20:00:41 EDT <ChrisComminsRLA> Hey, Xfinity, any internet outages at Jax Beach, 32259? We can‚Äôt connect
1258903559749468162 2020-05-08 19:36:12 EDT <Card0B> @Xfinity i don‚Äôt usually complain, but this is now the 4th day of work I have missed because of your service outages. Ever since this whole Covid 18 quarantine started, my service has been acting up.
1258900552576008195 2020-05-08 19:24:15 EDT <DNC_XV> My Xfinity Internet has an outage during Quarantine. Comcast you have failed this city LoL üòÄüòÄüòÄ
1258897392302252033 2020-05-08 19:11:42 EDT <innerconx> @Xfinity another night another outage. There is an outage in your area. 5 minutes later outage fixed. Uh no it hasn‚Äôt then we started the whole process over in the end no services and no one is fixing it. Poor customer service especially now
1258888634444349440 2020-05-08 18:36:54 EDT <StayChilly91> Bruh Xfinity be wildin with these outages but wanna charge an arm n leg for internet.. My face:  pic.twitter.com/BNvMEMM1hH
1258867285386760195 2020-05-08 17:12:04 EDT <olemissfan363> I did but no response. Our outage was just pushed back another 12 hours again. Can you please assist?
1258867100292128773 2020-05-08 17:11:19 EDT <olemissfan363> Our outage has went from 4 pm to 4 am to 4 pm now back to 4 am again for two days. Can we get an eta please. People have to work from home during this quarantine....
1258859596216664069 2020-05-08 16:41:30 EDT <Ron_Deuce77> Xfinity has a outage everyday üòêüòêüòê
1258856763698425856 2020-05-08 16:30:15 EDT <UImaginARY_> @Xfinity your technicians are pulling up to people‚Äôs homes and lying and saying there is no one home and leaving instead of fixing the  internet outage. WE ARE SHELTERING IN PLACE IN ILLINOIS!!! WE ARE AT HOME AND UNABLE TO WORK DUE TO THE NEGLIGENCE OF YOUR TECHNICIANS
1258850525707198465 2020-05-08 16:05:28 EDT <innerconx> Imagine calling and texting @Xfinity and @comcastcares for almost 5 days. And still no service. First there is an outage that will be fixed. Then it‚Äôs fixed but it‚Äôs not and over and over again
1258848212888289284 2020-05-08 15:56:16 EDT <WahPowWonder> @Xfinity Hello my internet has been out for the past couple days. Our wifi is not showing up on devices. Restarting the modem & router didn't help. Xfinity account shows no outages in my area but can't connect to my modem. I was waiting on chat support for hours and nobody came.
1258838587258343430 2020-05-08 15:18:01 EDT <jbrotherlove> And in classic Xfinity fuckery, after rebooting my modem, router, and NAS, NOW they report an outage.  pic.twitter.com/uZU8iCMuSA
1258837854807035904 2020-05-08 15:15:07 EDT <KevinMendezIII> @Xfinity Your customer support is absolutely atrocious. I‚Äôve had an outage since Sunday with brief service yesterday, and you keep pushing the timer back every 12 hours. Your agents response was to try to plug your streaming app WHEN I DONT EVEN HAVE INTERNET.
1258832381605302272 2020-05-08 14:53:22 EDT <kayotikmunky> Mine are slow because my @ATT is slow as hell in my area. Fastest I can pay for is 75mbps and I‚Äôm lucky to get 30, no matter how many times they replace the modem or send techs out. @Xfinity is faster but suffers from a lot of outages.
1258815489477718016 2020-05-08 13:46:15 EDT <DiZ_VetLyfe> Another outage ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

1258809806762045445 2020-05-08 13:23:40 EDT <hoot_enanny> @Xfinity second outage In a week? I‚Äôm literally not getting paid if I cannot work. This is fucked up

1258787176357064707 2020-05-08 11:53:44 EDT <tim80126> @comcast @Xfinity What is going on with the continued service outages in Highlands Ranch, CO- going on all week and impossible to get through to a live person w/ terrible Comcast voice prompt system- getting incredibly frustrated with this terrible service- the worst
1258784246363275264 2020-05-08 11:42:06 EDT <Xfinity> Hey Steve. When these outages happen are there updates on your service in the My Account app?
1258783793793708035 2020-05-08 11:40:18 EDT <stevensande> C‚Äômon, @xfinity. Three days in a row of intermittent outages when we‚Äôre working from home? Get it fixed once and for all.
1258776178955096065 2020-05-08 11:10:02 EDT <Xfinity> We apologize for the frustration. Have you checked the My Account app to see if there have been any outages in your area?
1258753185864462336 2020-05-08 09:38:40 EDT <BrunoPittsburgh> @comcast @Xfinity outage in the Philly area??
1258746814125297665 2020-05-08 09:13:21 EDT <lisa_j_duncan> @Xfinity @comcast what is up with the massive Nashville outage...going on a week now, what are you doing for your customers?  And when can we expect service?  You make it hard to be a customer.  No other internet/cable providers are having this issue.
1258743353535016961 2020-05-08 08:59:36 EDT <olemissfan363> Hold on! An agent called me and just said ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not god take it up with him‚Äù due to this outage. That really y‚Äôall a customer service? üòÇ seriously
1258739125122990080 2020-05-08 08:42:48 EDT <olemissfan363> I can‚Äôt even get ahold of a person on your phone line due to the outage it just redirects me to an automated message saying 4 pm again but no actual information. Please help
1258738302020210688 2020-05-08 08:39:32 EDT <Xfinity> Hey Ian. We update the Xfinity My Account app regularly with outage information! That's the quickest way to check.
1258738254163193857 2020-05-08 08:39:20 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Joel. We know how important reliable service is to you, now more than ever. We are taking a number of steps to ensure you remain connected to your Xfinity services. Keep checking the My Account app for all outage updates.
1258737646064545792 2020-05-08 08:36:55 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Sara. Have you checked the Xfinity My Account app yet? If there is an outage or planned maintenance you'll get all the updates through the app.
1258735768673157120 2020-05-08 08:29:28 EDT <olemissfan363> @Xfinity can I get someone to call me for an update on our outage here? Yesterday you said it would be up by 4 pm yesterday then at 4 you said it would be 4 am now today you say it‚Äôll be 4 pm today. Can someone call me with an actual eta. I need to know so I can plan for work lol
1258734091643637760 2020-05-08 08:22:48 EDT <hey_virg> An outage can happen anytime, but if it‚Äôs schedule it‚Äôs for a reason
1258733578562699270 2020-05-08 08:20:45 EDT <NameBrandSmith> Yep same here. Y‚Äôall know people work from home and you think the best time for an outage is during the day during the week??
1258731604542963713 2020-05-08 08:12:55 EDT <heyGOODLOOKING_> ‚ÄúOutage detected in area‚Äù on my business but the cable and shit work smh
1258730010246070272 2020-05-08 08:06:35 EDT <JenAnsbach> I pay $70 a month for service that @comcastcares @Xfinity openly admits that they can see has intermittent outages all day and can‚Äôt sustain video chats. They said that they can‚Äôt fix it until the pandemic is over. I‚Äôm not kidding.
1258725352375046145 2020-05-08 07:48:04 EDT <innerconx> @comcastcares @Xfinity  we‚Äôre sorry there‚Äôs another outage in your area. Expected resolution 1130. Every day same story you do have network engineers right? Node issues are not  hard to track down guys
1258724863310733313 2020-05-08 07:46:08 EDT <skuzemewoods> @comcastcares @Xfinity any outages in Pembroke pines FL? As much as I don't want to do any work, I probably should be connected to the internet, but... Nothing this morning.
1258717920085061632 2020-05-08 07:18:32 EDT <joellawler> Now is a bad time for outages.  When will it be fixed?
1258717888858513408 2020-05-08 07:18:25 EDT <innerconx> @Xfinity @comcastcares  I‚Äôm convinced Comcast doesn‚Äôt care.  No services again in my area I‚Äôm not sure wtf to talk to get this resolved. Calling does nothing and neither does Twitter.  Since mid April almost daily outages. This week every day and night
1258651041953873921 2020-05-08 02:52:47 EDT <MxneyMxtivated> Sooo I was gonna have a vibe session with the boys tonight but apparently xfinity wanna have an outage... if they‚Äôve been having many around the nation lately and now they say they‚Äôre under maintenance and won‚Äôt end till 6am Eastern time... #xfinityoutage
1258631395062231040 2020-05-08 01:34:43 EDT <crisstofyr> Why is it so difficult for @xfinity to give customers notice before these ‚Äúroutine‚Äù events are going to happen?  At least give people a way to opt-in to be notified of planned outages.  pic.twitter.com/SNYbmPw69j
1258629577842274304 2020-05-08 01:27:30 EDT <_c0ldAsIce_> Right!? Idk what's going on with 2020 but if we catch a mass power outage during a pandemic.... I'm going for the high ground you feel me?
1258596254973480960 2020-05-07 23:15:05 EDT <emerald_nw> Sorry I havnt been consistent  with my streams on the last few days. Xfinity had done maintenance near our house to better our areas service and messed something up so bad that our area has consistent service outages
1258576012335550465 2020-05-07 21:54:39 EDT <WaldPerksTV> @Xfinity shitternet ruining yet another amazing stream. Paying for gig and I‚Äôm getting 100/2 and there‚Äôs ‚Äúno outages in your area‚Äù
1258571131759575041 2020-05-07 21:35:15 EDT <Xfinity> Have you tried restarting the modem after the outage notification was no longer showing on the app?
1258569471930834944 2020-05-07 21:28:39 EDT <Xfinity> üòû Are you in an area outage?
1258565854301614082 2020-05-07 21:14:17 EDT <sjsg__> I‚Äôve missed 2 full days of work because @Xfinity. First time there was an outage in my area and second time just because their internet sucks but hey they gave me a $20 credit towards my account...
1258559813883170822 2020-05-07 20:50:17 EDT <Lovely_Meee> So xfinity gone text me saying there‚Äôs an outage in my area and they‚Äôre working on resolving it by midnight ... MIDNIGHT ?!?
1258558951597236226 2020-05-07 20:46:51 EDT <Ley__E> Was tricked into paying my damn cable bill üò© xfinity didn‚Äôt tell me until after I paid my damn bill it was an outage around my way üòí I need a refund ü•∫
1258553455918100481 2020-05-07 20:25:01 EDT <SaintSheed> Xfinity keeps having outages.  pic.twitter.com/lw1oThRdT0

1258496357318512653 2020-05-07 16:38:07 EDT <25thKiichi> So Xfinity is having an outage apparently and my LTE Data is garbage for some reason  pic.twitter.com/1rXkXo5F1O

1258481948332343299 2020-05-07 15:40:52 EDT <_justin_sane> @Xfinity hi just lost a big business deal because of an outage in the Chicago area? When can I expect this backup to continue my job? Don‚Äôt want to join the unemployment population because of you all.
1258479414205198337 2020-05-07 15:30:48 EDT <rickysalsberry> Another day, another @Comcast outage during business hours.   @Xfinity @comcastcares

1258473172816584711 2020-05-07 15:06:00 EDT <dr_fcbutler> Didn‚Äôt have an outage until maintenance was being performed. Again, this could have waited until after regular biz hours.  pic.twitter.com/HAiM45F7dN
1258457493002428418 2020-05-07 14:03:41 EDT <ntrljazz> xfinity steady having power outages like i‚Äôm not working from home.

1258448732682665995 2020-05-07 13:28:53 EDT <Xfinity> Hi there. Do you have the Xfinity My Account app downloaded? All outage or maintenance information and updates will be provided to you there. If not, you can always login and check:  https://comca.st/2WcZVgX¬† for more info.
1258441752991547394 2020-05-07 13:01:09 EDT <_ccrbun88> @Xfinity No internet service in SF. Is there an outage? Unplugged and plugged the modem after 20 seconds, still no connection.
1258439869669404672 2020-05-07 12:53:40 EDT <Chakalnomics> @Xfinity always with your fucking outages
1258437470540218369 2020-05-07 12:44:08 EDT <jmotts78> @Xfinity - so not only has my internet been down due to outages every day for the last 2 weeks for at least 1-2 hours per incident, but not I‚Äôm not even allowed to speak to a human being for customer service?
1258422749086855168 2020-05-07 11:45:38 EDT <Mixthempeppers> @Xfinity Can something be done about my next bill being lowered? These outages have been ridiculous as of late.
1258420476088647681 2020-05-07 11:36:36 EDT <Xfinity> Is the Xfinity My Account app reporting an outage or maintenance?
1258411596533116928 2020-05-07 11:01:19 EDT <wayne_vt> If there was ANY alternative to @Xfinity in my area I would switch. Can‚Äôt connect to anything and no outage showing when several customers in this are have no service.
1258407139900485633 2020-05-07 10:43:36 EDT <morgant> @comcastcares Experiencing an outage. Have reset router & modem, but Xfinity still says "having trouble finding a signal". Outage Map doesn't show an outage in my area, but maybe it's too soon. Been 25 mins now.
1258403928363995136 2020-05-07 10:30:51 EDT <GloriMonarrez> Can we get a deduction on our bill for having to miss out on work and e learning for this outage? üôÉ
1258403433247277059 2020-05-07 10:28:53 EDT <Erybdyh8CHRIS> A fuckin outage #xfinity ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è CMON NOW DAWG
1258400692663914496 2020-05-07 10:17:59 EDT <Xfinity> You can check the Xfinity My Account app to see if there has been an outage or maintenance reported.
1258380107951017985 2020-05-07 08:56:11 EDT <BetaJim89> So here‚Äôs my pitch. @ATT dropped the ball. Outages happen but I don‚Äôt think I can deal with this anymore. @Xfinity , @verizonfios and anyone else whose interested‚Äî make me an offer and I‚Äôll drop my 4 year+ plan today if @ATT isn‚Äôt up by noon CST.
1258362634942001152 2020-05-07 07:46:46 EDT <daveydoh> @Xfinity As of yesterday I have not been able to connect to the internet and Xfinity is not able to pick up a signal. My modem is brand new from Xfinity and the online light won't turn on! I've restarted the modem several times...ans there are no outages in my area! Whats wrong?
1258358775016304644 2020-05-07 07:31:25 EDT <Shijax> @comcastcares @Xfinity thanks for being down yet again.  Seriously. Believe me, if we had an actual decent provider in Nashville, we‚Äôd switch in a heartbeat. So tired of paying for your constant outages. I mean, it‚Äôs not like anyone has to actually work from home.
1258310285707755520 2020-05-07 04:18:45 EDT <will_that_boy> @Xfinity third night in a row with an outage smh
1258308390847049728 2020-05-07 04:11:13 EDT <RyaNatsu> There is a pandemic, how is there an outage. What maintenance is required during this time? Xfinity is so pathetic.
1258281929692123136 2020-05-07 02:26:04 EDT <JohnWal18484615> @comcastcares @Xfinity  nice to see another outage for "maintenance" the second night in a row...
1258272183219970049 2020-05-07 01:47:20 EDT <shaunamcknight> @Xfinity you really don‚Äôt make it easy to report an outage do you ...
1258270320533766144 2020-05-07 01:39:56 EDT <FarahRaidhan> @Xfinity what the hell is going on?? Every night at this time my internet goes off till the morning. Every night there is an outage?? This is ridiculous! Is this why I‚Äôm paying $80 every mnth for internet?
1258251528600727552 2020-05-07 00:25:16 EDT <Birdyist> I was about to enjoy some Pok√©mon online and then Xfinity getting an outage in my area. I hate this @Xfinity  pic.twitter.com/ZgJaj7Jpiq
1258247604649037825 2020-05-07 00:09:40 EDT <_ChristinG> @Xfinity  intermittent outages for the last 3 days!! 4 kids and myself trying to work/school from home. End of day 3 had enough tried to call  to find out why or when it‚Äôs going to stop and cannot get to a live person! Maybe you can help!seriously frustrated
1258245566586290183 2020-05-07 00:01:34 EDT <JorgeGuapo22> Xfinity outage? In this economy?   Welp, guess I‚Äôll just stare at the wall, now.
1258233180651479041 2020-05-06 23:12:21 EDT <Steve615> I'm in Murfreesboro and have #xfinity for internet service only. There have been occasional outages over here, but not any to speak of lately. Here's hoping you get your service back asap.
1258229854937460738 2020-05-06 22:59:08 EDT <alvino5511> @Xfinity and what else is new yet another outage with Comcast. I should get a refund for the whole month with almost daily outages. 5/6/2020 9:58 pm
1258226499926151168 2020-05-06 22:45:48 EDT <erictbest> Beyond frustrated with the recurring outages @comcast @Xfinity Seattle! Endless text and phone support dead ends with no answers, no escalation, and no resolution. Please help.  pic.twitter.com/FltwR36WUZ
1258223416353718276 2020-05-06 22:33:33 EDT <Patrick86530692> Starting to wonder if @Xfinity will ever actually fix the internet outage in my area or if they have just all given up #saferathometheysay
1258208981643866120 2020-05-06 21:36:12 EDT <rabbit1906> Why @Xfinity set a service replace the outside cable in my house when all outage during last 10 days are affecting between 51-500 subscribers ? Are they being honest about the issue?
1258201220633604097 2020-05-06 21:05:21 EDT <kf> last night, woke up at 1am and discovered there was an xfinity outage  I have since been EXTREMELY HIGH ANXIETY worried it was going to happen again, and that I would be stuck at home alone in my apartment with no internet  anyway coping with COVID-19 super great, you?
1258193270238257153 2020-05-06 20:33:46 EDT <elylucas> Down in Broomfield as well with a confirmed outage on their site
1258190852452683787 2020-05-06 20:24:09 EDT <Xfinity> Is there an outage reported in the app? You can also check here:  https://comca.st/2zm0n39¬†
1258187599354769410 2020-05-06 20:11:14 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Jared! You can check your My Account app to see if there's an area outage reported.
1258182303790116864 2020-05-06 19:50:11 EDT <JaredMcElroyKu> @Xfinity are you having an abnormal amount of outages in the Denver area?
1258176856118800384 2020-05-06 19:28:32 EDT <MattAvellar> Same thing here. Internet is down daily and the Comcast status map never shows an outage. They only respond with scripted, non-helpful lines. I feel your pain
1258176774615322625 2020-05-06 19:28:13 EDT <nida34822121> Hi, I just checked and there are no service outages in my area. This has been happening for a while now
1258174381643239425 2020-05-06 19:18:42 EDT <mindofmikel> I was all alone in the room and there‚Äôs an xfinity outage so I couldn‚Äôt rewind. I was dying all by myself but she definitely said ‚Äúfucking‚Äù.  https://twitter.com/T0phD0gg/status/1258170722213482497¬†‚Ä¶
1258171560189399040 2020-05-06 19:07:30 EDT <JamesSt69784878> @Xfinity @comcast Why are ya'll not reporting the outage in my area? My internet has been down since the storms came through Nashville Sunday night. Linemen have been working all day to replace some utility poles that were snapped during the storm. Admit my outage please
1258158424937775105 2020-05-06 18:15:18 EDT <ElaineMorgan24> Yes there was an outage and it was reported at noon. It is still not fixed. I have not been able to work since 12. Honestly, For the last 3 weeks it has not been a reliable connection AT ALL and we are unable to get ahold of anyone. So frustrating.
1258157717048438784 2020-05-06 18:12:29 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Melissa. Have you checked your My Account app to see if there's an outage reported in your area?
1258156895963152385 2020-05-06 18:09:14 EDT <djinnsour> Switched to fiber symmetric Gigabit from #ATT , unlimited bandwidth, about 18 months ago.  Not a single outage, always getting over 700Mb/s to my office and I always get 4K streaming. Paying $120 less per month, without any discounts, than I was paying for 300/100 from #Xfinity.
1258155084787130372 2020-05-06 18:02:02 EDT <thedjmickey> Between @NBA2K servers and @Xfinity outages I‚Äôm literally gonna go insane
1258151741176131584 2020-05-06 17:48:45 EDT <aaronjbailey227> @xfinity I‚Äôm aware of the article, I‚Äôve read over it. Doesn‚Äôt mention the ‚Äúgoat-roping‚Äù you‚Äôre doing with outage updates or ETAs. Additionally customers shouldn‚Äôt have to call for rebates after outages are repaired. Your know your service isn‚Äôt being ultilized, make it right.
1258150874188316672 2020-05-06 17:45:18 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Aaron. We understand how critically important it is for our customers to be connected right now and we will continue to work around the clock until services are fully restored for every customer. Info on this outage here:  https://comca.st/3bbnCdN¬†
1258149321737994243 2020-05-06 17:39:08 EDT <_Ms_Brown> And @Xfinity  why do y‚Äôall have so many WiFi outages in one month!!üò© only 6 days into May and this is the second time it‚Äôs out...
1258148995345547264 2020-05-06 17:37:50 EDT <CWSDingerZone> Happened to me about 1am last night. Pay 10 million dollars (the content is great but too many outages)
1258140491943641089 2020-05-06 17:04:03 EDT <drmmrk> Yes.  I am watching the outage map, and it continues to say unplanned outage in my zip code.  No estimated time of resolution.
1258139918574014472 2020-05-06 17:01:46 EDT <Xfinity> Do you have the Xfinity My Account app? The app will provide outage updates along with an estimated time of resolution.
1258134044761559041 2020-05-06 16:38:25 EDT <drmmrk> Did anyone else lose their @Xfinity internet service in Bloomington, MN around 6 PM last night?  I texted with customer service for 2 hours, rebooted modem many times, and no service.  Outage map shows "unplanned outage" as of 3:15 PM today!
1258130753549991936 2020-05-06 16:25:21 EDT <Miguel70kgUSA> Come on @Xfinity! I just upped my speed a few weeks ago, am paying an arm and a leg, and I STILL have DAILY outages. How am I supposed to work from home when, clearly no one on your end is  doing so?! It‚Äôs so bad I literally never have my phone connected to our home WiFi.
1258117710791282689 2020-05-06 15:33:31 EDT <Izz_Bizzcuty> @CenturyLink great another outage. I‚Äôm starting to get the notion that @Xfinity is becoming more reliable.
1258111317073965056 2020-05-06 15:08:07 EDT <Xfinity> What's going on with your internet? Are you in an area outage?
1258110475121963010 2020-05-06 15:04:46 EDT <ATLLAEV> Unproductive work day with ‚Äúintermittent‚Äù internet outages due to a @Xfinity system upgrades. #Quarantine #ShelterInPlace #COVID19
1258101887678722053 2020-05-06 14:30:39 EDT <rgiraldi> Great time for my @Xfinity internet to crap the bed. First modem issues and now apparently a legit outage in my area. Good thing I don't have kids or today's curriculum might be studying Harry Potter movies on DVD.
1258098861085798400 2020-05-06 14:18:37 EDT <Rshapiro84> It would be nice to have a timeframe of when @Xfinity and @comcastcares plans on network outages in #FortLauderdale so I could plan my work accordingly.
1258093120220278784 2020-05-06 13:55:48 EDT <TaylorOlijar> @Xfinity Thanks for having a continual internet outage in the south suburbs of Chicago since early this morning. Guess my kids don‚Äôt have to do school work today. -#worstinternetprovider

1258079126541332480 2020-05-06 13:00:12 EDT <lisachan13> @Xfinity we are experiencing our 5th wifi outage in 7 days because of ‚Äúmaintenance‚Äù. It would be great to have a heads up so that my kids and me can work remotely. We are having to connect to hotspots in order to work, and it‚Äôs eating all of our data. Thanks!

1258075305165631488 2020-05-06 12:45:01 EDT <blackgalsrock> Xfinity outage.. jus paid a bill of almost 180.00 a few days ago and an Outage. During these times I was listening to Mayor Bowser update Coronavirus. This is Unacceptable  No phone either.
1258074821050560512 2020-05-06 12:43:05 EDT <karenbko> Internet outage for @Xfinity ... ughhh üò≠üò°
1258074548458721287 2020-05-06 12:42:00 EDT <Akito__Tenkawa> YOU ARE NOT WORKING 24 hours. We have a total outage of internet and cable on Pine Rd in Port St Lucie and you are not even sending anyone FOR TWO DAYS!!!!!!
1258074135223250949 2020-05-06 12:40:22 EDT <Akito__Tenkawa> They just don't care. None of their trucks seem to be out working to fix outages. People are losing income and they are taking it slow and easy.
1258073098487828480 2020-05-06 12:36:15 EDT <life_ofjosh> How long this outage gone be @Xfinity I got a lot of work to do üò©
1258072975552794629 2020-05-06 12:35:45 EDT <Akito__Tenkawa> Will be days before they do anything. We have a total outage of cable and internet on Pine Rd In Port St Lucie, FL... people are working from home and losing income by the hour. @Xfinity says they will send someone IN TWO DAYS!!!!!! That bill always comes on time though...
1258072170745528320 2020-05-06 12:32:34 EDT <Akito__Tenkawa> They do not care about you one little bit. We have a total outage on Pine Rd in Port St Lucie, FL and they have done nothing for two days. No cable, no internet. We have huge lost income from it. @Xfinity  does nothing.
1258071089697239047 2020-05-06 12:28:16 EDT <comcast> Hi there. The Xfinity My Account app will provide any outage updates. -Gabbie
1258069974238855168 2020-05-06 12:23:50 EDT <DDangerfeld> @comcastcares The Xfinity Hotspot at 87th and Kenton in Hometown, IL is not working. Supposedly the outage is over...but no internet. #xfinity
1258067262893785090 2020-05-06 12:13:03 EDT <aloke_mahato> Complete @comcast outage here in Millbrae, CA since midnight. This is so frustrating when you rely on internet to work. @comcastcares has only bots to reply.

1258064029815373825 2020-05-06 12:00:13 EDT <LekishaOliver> Maybe I'm overthinking this, but with all the power outages that @NESpower has, our bills will be lower, but what about no service from @Xfinity for days on end? Will we have a lower bill next month of the same? Makes ya wonder.
1258063424640213001 2020-05-06 11:57:48 EDT <super_teddy> @comcastcares @comcast @Xfinity We have had intermittent internet outage EVERY DAY since the end of April, 2020 in Brandon MS. We didn‚Äôt have any tornado storms during these days. I have to work from home. This is not acceptable during this pandemic!!!
1258043461942509569 2020-05-06 10:38:29 EDT <sdshivas> @Xfinity @Comcast What the scoop on fixing the Nashville outages? You just move the estimates 12 hours each time you miss them. NES did a wonderful of keeping customer informed, why can't you?
1258039857307365381 2020-05-06 10:24:09 EDT <tmskipper86> I talk/chat with a representative daily. Just told there is an area wide outage and keep checking back. No real eta, and if I get one it changes every 12 hours.  Zip: 37076 Search Twitter for #comcastoutage and Xfinity  Nashville...there are more people with this issue.
1258036846510120961 2020-05-06 10:12:12 EDT <theofletcherII> Dammit. Xfinity has an outage over here. But once they clear it up I‚Äôm gonna find it. Good looking out!  pic.twitter.com/22PyDrjuej
1258024739525844992 2020-05-06 09:24:05 EDT <comcast> We know how important reliable service is to you, now more than ever. We are taking a number of steps to ensure you remain connected to your Xfinity services. If the outage map isn't available online then you can also access it through the My Account app. -Taja
1258011564206166016 2020-05-06 08:31:44 EDT <JoFaSho2506> @Xfinity your bullshit company won't take any calls from people in my area of the outage. Every day since Sunday you put a new time that it will be fixed and it does not happen. Guess what it was not fixed at 4am today, now says it will be fixed close to 5pm again today  pic.twitter.com/IW6ZNbcTIY
1258000349195128832 2020-05-06 07:47:10 EDT <lattesncastles> Hour 8 into todays @Xfinity outage thus far.  It is MIND BOGGLING to me that we are showing on the map as the highest number affected, and not only are we back down, but every single other area from yesterday is back or still down too.
1257953907826782208 2020-05-06 04:42:37 EDT <_Dswish> Damn Xfinity outage messing everything up  pic.twitter.com/obDwOw6uAI
1257950986707951621 2020-05-06 04:31:01 EDT <MattF_NorCal> My cable modem and I very much disagree, @Xfinity. (The fact that my ZIP code, and every surrounding one on the map, are all reporting "unplanned" outages affecting >2,500 customers is also working against you here.)  pic.twitter.com/H29fO5YAVq
1257947831639306242 2020-05-06 04:18:29 EDT <heimzzy> Yo @Xfinity wtf is up with all the network outages?
1257936716825915394 2020-05-06 03:34:19 EDT <Harms_Loona> @Xfinity 2 outages in a row. Not surprised. Disappointed. Hopefully fiber comes to my area soon
1257932586577518592 2020-05-06 03:17:54 EDT <icequality> @Xfinity I‚Äôm tired of y‚Äôall & these damn outages.. fix it damn it
1257916750672396288 2020-05-06 02:14:58 EDT <IndicaJones20> @Xfinity 60482  Outage... again.  Happening more frequently.
1257912372854956032 2020-05-06 01:57:35 EDT <KimRathbone> Yep, and probably offer little to no discount for the time it was out.  If the power company can restore tens of thousands of customers within hours of a storm,  you'd think cable and internet for 2500 according to their outage map would be possible ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüö´ü§¨
1257909439086108672 2020-05-06 01:45:55 EDT <Fifletta> No BS, @xfinity better fix this outage
1257899024574750720 2020-05-06 01:04:32 EDT <AriKaye3> @Xfinity when are you gonna fix the outage in Aspen, CO? Doesn‚Äôt seem like your committed to keeping us connected at all
1257897756041101312 2020-05-06 00:59:30 EDT <AriKaye3> @Xfinity what‚Äôs up with the outage is Aspen, CO? You gonna get this fixed for us? We‚Äôre working from home
1257879114096279552 2020-05-05 23:45:25 EDT <hopelesspatel> @comcastcares @comcast @Xfinity I had an internet outage - gets resolved - I get a call if I wanted an upgrade and Flex for $10 more and there is outage again. Like, WTF?  Brian Roberts get your fucking folks together! So fucking ridiculous! #nashville #comcastoutage
1257873729616596995 2020-05-05 23:24:01 EDT <SherryBlakemore> @Xfinity @comcast  when will you let your Nashville area customers know what is going on with the service outage. Your estimated times are worthless.
1257872807490453505 2020-05-05 23:20:22 EDT <Bharath_Rayam> @Xfinity @comcast @comcastcares please do soemthing effective for the internet outage..  https://twitter.com/aspiringfairie/status/1257394939505377280¬†‚Ä¶
1257871391308857345 2020-05-05 23:14:44 EDT <AlexLittleTN> Who knows? Their app keeps pushing the estimated time out 12 hours. It's insane they can't tell folks how long of an outage to expect
1257858341226909697 2020-05-05 22:22:53 EDT <LeonatoLynx> No use... Y'all just can't seem to get your act together in Donelson this time... This is the longest outage we've ever had...
1257852769966477319 2020-05-05 22:00:44 EDT <Xfinity> We want to look into this outage and get an update for your area. Send us a DM here:  https://xfin.tv/support¬† üëà

1257839785739202560 2020-05-05 21:09:09 EDT <AmandaEmilyB> Hey @Xfinity @comcast, any update on the outage in Nashville? We‚Äôre over 53 hours since it went out and your outage maps just keeps pushing the ETA out 12 hours every time you miss the target. #pleasefixmyinternet #nashvillestorms
1257823106263134216 2020-05-05 20:02:52 EDT <left4donut> @Xfinity  So I've got this issue where my internet keeps dropping multiple times a night and it's been doing this for weeks. I've checked all my connections, reset my modem, there are no outages in my area, etc.  Any suggestions?
1257823000696586242 2020-05-05 20:02:27 EDT <comcast> Hey, be sure to check the Xfinity My Account app. The app will provide outage information, along with an estimated time of resolution. -Chris
1257821785241853952 2020-05-05 19:57:37 EDT <Damoose_isloose> @Xfinity how the hell do we have an outage 2 nights in a row when the essential@employees are@getting home@and just starting to unwind. I literally pay $200+ a month for this service and we can‚Äôt keep a sustaind service.
1257821208914980865 2020-05-05 19:55:20 EDT <tekniik_> Actually true. Had them for 3 years now never any major outages or slows besides some resets at like 3 am very rarely.
1257816585856864256 2020-05-05 19:36:57 EDT <carajanescott> No outages showing‚ÄîI‚Äôve restarted everything and checked cable connections numerous times but both my TV box and modem are saying they can‚Äôt connect. I was trying to get more help when robot lady hung up on me lol.
1257811140438081536 2020-05-05 19:15:19 EDT <Akito__Tenkawa> @Xfinity No internet or cable on Pine Rd in Port St Lucie, FL. Numerous homes outage.  Support says they will "try" to send someone over on Thursday...TWO DAYS FROM NOW!!!!!! I work from home... more lost income. @comcastcares
1257807514868961281 2020-05-05 19:00:55 EDT <DridnfrankH> Can you look into this....Xfinity Comcast is having a massive outage....could it be related??!  pic.twitter.com/rCOlGHAxjh

1257801048711970816 2020-05-05 18:35:13 EDT <AlDubFanDMV> So it‚Äôs not just in my little area in MD then. @Xfinity I am an educator working from home and the outage started yesterday morning‚Äî7:30am-4:30 pm. And today outage again starting at 5:00 pm. Come on now ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòñü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1257797939495342083 2020-05-05 18:22:52 EDT <JeffSchervone> Outages caused interruptions in work and widespread (in our house) panic. Gateway firmware needed to be updated, done through xFi chatbot/person 'Clio.' This resulted in fear that your equipment is a Trojan Horse and the Wuhan virus is strangling our rights, all for  $199.99/mo
1257792365563129863 2020-05-05 18:00:43 EDT <jmfield47_jim> @Xfinity three days in a row there have been outages. Most all day yesterday and today. A few hours on Sunday. Spoke with technician yesterday and he‚Äôs been out numerous times to repair and replace almost every component. Fix it. Cascade Point, Jacksonville Florida
1257790791067611139 2020-05-05 17:54:27 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Thea. Are you in an area outage?
1257788741000798208 2020-05-05 17:46:19 EDT <Xfinity> If your service doesn't come back on in the next hour or so, and your app still doesn't indicate an outage, send us a DM here:  https://xfin.tv/support¬† and we can check on it.
1257785727494094849 2020-05-05 17:34:20 EDT <andrew_delivers> Does @Xfinity really know when the outage will be fixed or will they just keep changing the repaired by time back every 12 hours? Seriously we have a generator for power so really really need some WiFi and tv back.
1257782248520052737 2020-05-05 17:20:31 EDT <aghenis> @comcast @Xfinity are you having outages in #Berkeley CA? Wondering if it's the system or my router
1257780300303589376 2020-05-05 17:12:46 EDT <Xfinity> Hey. Is there an outage reported on your My Account app?
1257773286521356289 2020-05-05 16:44:54 EDT <MularWah> @PlayVALORANT 2 days ago, xfinity had a power outage which cause me to leave my Ranked game in a 5 stack. Today I rejoin and deranked. maybe valorant should have an option after every game saying if "This "person" left on purpose or not" for my teammates and any inconveniences.
1257764742183227393 2020-05-05 16:10:57 EDT <Sun_shyn81> @Xfinity this intermittent service outage due to the maintenance multiple times a day over the past few weeks is redundant and inconvenient to say the least.... this has to stop. How am I supposed to work like this #fedup #xfinitysucks
1257763168149032965 2020-05-05 16:04:42 EDT <ben98551> No there isn‚Äôt an area outage, my internet has been going out sporadically over the past 3 days. I‚Äôve reset the router/modem about 3 times
1257761167625388034 2020-05-05 15:56:45 EDT <Xfinity> What's going on with your internet? Are you in an area outage?

1257739199786213379 2020-05-05 14:29:27 EDT <MrsJeniseSexton> Thanks for responding. I checked after your prompting and it says we couldn‚Äôt find any outages or service issues. But it‚Äôs still producing snail like speeds. üò©
1257738103512535042 2020-05-05 14:25:06 EDT <Xfinity> Hey Jenise. Have you checked your My Account app to see if there's an outage reported in your area?
1257737016344588288 2020-05-05 14:20:46 EDT <cruxcrusher> I swear @Xfinity is the worst ISP I'm forced to use. 3 dropped video calls in the last 20 minutes and the service outage map says there's unplanned outages in my ZIP but a rep insists that everything is fine #Comcastoutage @comcastcares
1257736458443657216 2020-05-05 14:18:33 EDT <ThometzOfficial> @Xfinity I contacted your support team, and the bot said there would be an outage in our area tomorrow to fix some stuff with the internet. Could this be the cause for the slow/non stable upload speeds?
1257735537009602560 2020-05-05 14:14:54 EDT <beergogglesrach> @Xfinity said there are internet outages for routine maintenance today from 8am-4pm. So basically a full workday? Chill.
1257733298375327745 2020-05-05 14:06:00 EDT <innerconx> @Xfinity @comcastcares hi guys. We have been having almost hourly outages here since mid April in our area. All services. We can‚Äôt seem to get any help. Up and down all day and then for hours. We need some help.
1257725071508099080 2020-05-05 13:33:19 EDT <stumpteacher> There were no outages. Was a faulty piece of equipment...which was brand new. So now I am waiting for replacement.
1257724786958106624 2020-05-05 13:32:11 EDT <_2FlyDinero> It‚Äôs really an outage every single week with Xfinity smhhhhh

1257717565368999942 2020-05-05 13:03:29 EDT <sherrimckinney> Dear @comcast @Xfinity a two day service outage for people who need to work form home is not okay. It has been nothing but problems since we started using your service. #getittogether
1257715397605896192 2020-05-05 12:54:52 EDT <devinwzrd> xfinity on that weekly outage bullshit
1257713729065680897 2020-05-05 12:48:14 EDT <hopelesspatel> @Xfinity @comcastcares Tom Karinshak & Brian Roberts - You of all people should understand the gravity of Internet Outage under this situation. It merely SUCKS! @ATT You might hear from me soon! #xfinityoutage #internetdown #nashville
1257711405937102848 2020-05-05 12:39:00 EDT <LaconicIcon> Dear @Xfinity I do not need this outage negativity in my life today.

1257692230384566272 2020-05-05 11:22:49 EDT <_allenmoore> Hey @xfinity stop being such a crappy company and fix your outages in a time frame faster than 4 hours
1257691828410875908 2020-05-05 11:21:13 EDT <Xfinity> Hi, are you a part of an outage?
1257684840176144387 2020-05-05 10:53:27 EDT <dvissy> Xfinity has an outage going on and I hate not using the wifi :/
1257684551612186625 2020-05-05 10:52:18 EDT <lovekdot> Whelp I was actually working at home and then @Xfinity decided they wanted to have service outages. Y‚Äôall trash af.
1257682775987060744 2020-05-05 10:45:15 EDT <BryonFellows> Nothing like @SMITEGame patch day and having @comcast @Xfinity to ensure you get dc and internet outages in the same day heres to hoping they realize its not me. I don't quit games like this. This is stupid!!!
1257680650104160256 2020-05-05 10:36:48 EDT <kristidrenth> @comcastcares @Xfinity In Nashville, TN and on day 2 of an internet outage. Can you provide any update as to what‚Äôs being done to restore and when we can expect to have service back?
1257666323703828481 2020-05-05 09:39:52 EDT <Xfinity> Although power at your address has been restored, there still might be power outages in the area that can impact the home services.  We are working with the electric company and our local tech team is working hard to make sure all services get restored as soon as possible.
1257665555290619907 2020-05-05 09:36:49 EDT <LewiHype> @Xfinity another outage?
1257661672824635396 2020-05-05 09:21:23 EDT <Xfinity> Due to the storm, there still maybe some power outages in your are which can impact your home services.  We are working with the electric company to make sure power get restored and our local tech team is working on getting your services restored as soon as possible.
1257660282446512130 2020-05-05 09:15:52 EDT <emowhat7> Second day in a row with WiFi outage @Xfinity what the f
1257651431936589824 2020-05-05 08:40:42 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Will - I know outages can be really frustrating. We can pull up your account to credit you for any downtime. Just send over your account information via DM:  http://xfin.tv/support¬† and the next available Digital Care Team agent can assist you.
1257650082750640130 2020-05-05 08:35:20 EDT <MelissaIsArtsy> Its unreal how often there is an @xfinity outage considering how many of us have to work from home. Honestly. One drop of rain, the internet drops out. @comcast is the worst. Another day of work, LOST because of this shit.
1257650036562894848 2020-05-05 08:35:09 EDT <CuppleOthoughts> Sent a DM yesterday to Comcast Cares and I‚Äôve heard nothing from them. Outage is still out and haven‚Äôt heard anything from you guys. This is ridiculous
1257642204224503809 2020-05-05 08:04:02 EDT <kevcrozier> Come on now @Xfinity @comcastcares‚Ä¶ I haven‚Äôt had internet for two days! This is unacceptable ‚Äî app doesn‚Äôt work and outage map is down.  pic.twitter.com/vqULb7ENAC
1257638066358976514 2020-05-05 07:47:35 EDT <SydneyMackMusic> @comcastcares tv/internet has been out since the power went out on Sunday at 4:30pm. Power came back @ 12:30pm yesterday, but Xfinity outage map says tv/internet won‚Äôt be restored until 4:30pm today. We are working from home‚Äî what is taking so long??
1257629511220420609 2020-05-05 07:13:35 EDT <HutchSevenSix> @Xfinity almost to 36 hours without internet or tv here in Nashville. You‚Äôre outage map just keeps adding 12 hours to the estimated time of repair each time. Need a real time I will have service again
1257615072139964417 2020-05-05 06:16:13 EDT <Harms_Loona> @Xfinity you know something is wrong with your services when ur Twitter feed is filled with dissatisfied and complaining customers. Oh yeah, outage btw
1257614660406251522 2020-05-05 06:14:35 EDT <ShayHagerty> @Xfinity ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨Day 2 service outage!!!!
1257610823402479618 2020-05-05 05:59:20 EDT <midtownandrew> @Xfinity my internet has been down for two days! Each day the outage solution goes forward by 12 hours! I have a job that requires the internet, and I‚Äôm thinking about changing services
1257569318054830081 2020-05-05 03:14:24 EDT <DocDorden> Its garbage. The constant loss of wifi connection or outages of 10 minutes 3 times a day.... they are a shit company
1257534233460879360 2020-05-05 00:54:59 EDT <MarkRecommends> Hey Lee... Network outage???
1257531342889328642 2020-05-05 00:43:30 EDT <tmskipper86> #comcastoutage #xfinity @Xfinity  how many days do I have to miss of work because you can't keep to your status outage update page?!?! Going on 2.5 days of no internet.. no work or school (for kids and me)!!!
1257525402114887680 2020-05-05 00:19:54 EDT <BigDogggCeee> @Xfinity  why do you have so many outages expect ppl to pay their bill
1257524001229934598 2020-05-05 00:14:20 EDT <ShayHagerty> On the Xfinity app it shows the outages in your area and it tells you when it will be "fixed"
1257523955495170051 2020-05-05 00:14:09 EDT <OniLink86> I REALLY wish that @Xfinity wasn't the only option for high speed internet here in my area. If I could I would leave them in a heartbeat. My internet has been spotty all day, and CS can't do a damn thing about it, and has apparently reported 0 outages in my area.
1257516920317734912 2020-05-04 23:46:11 EDT <unlsweetie> The Xfinity account is under my husband's name. Can you be more transparent with your outage information? Not everyone can access the app.
1257512586217582592 2020-05-04 23:28:58 EDT <justdeanbowlyou> @Xfinity @comcast why are these internet outages in Davis, CA happening?
1257497905121787904 2020-05-04 22:30:38 EDT <alyssathiii> There has been an @Xfinity outage in Davis since about 10am today. As a result i have missed turning in assignments on time, be present for any of my college lectures, or basically anything all day @comcastcares
1257497220103974914 2020-05-04 22:27:55 EDT <iClaytonbigs> @comcastcares @Xfinity So when is my internet going to be back online? (Denver) first you said 2:16 then you said 8:16. Now it just says as soon as possible... for this length of outage a meteor better have hit a satellite or something.
1257497024133427200 2020-05-04 22:27:08 EDT <oakeslisa> Mostly xfinity wireless connectivity is great here in the north of Davis, but having massive outages in two weeks has sucked.
1257496538042916865 2020-05-04 22:25:12 EDT <LarryTheWineGuy> If you are complaining about @Xfinity outages (and who isn't), please state your location such as Davis, CA so @comcastcares will know where they fucked up big time.
1257494620906221568 2020-05-04 22:17:35 EDT <LarryTheWineGuy> @Xfinity @comcastcares @CityofDavis Why can't  @comcast be upfront and honest about today's outage?  Don't tell us you are working on it, tell us what happened and when it will be fixed.   Some of us are working from home or attending online classes.
1257493601258360832 2020-05-04 22:13:32 EDT <TyShep12> @Xfinity Hi, customer here in Davis. I‚Äôm extremely frustrated over the outages that have been happening recently. It is critical I have reliable internet for my research and education.
1257491759371706368 2020-05-04 22:06:13 EDT <chubbiebunz> Holy. This is the longest Xfinity internet outage in Davis lol. Man I feel bad for my colleagues, students, and my housemates who are affected by this. This is ridiculous tho. The 2nd time it has happened.
1257491598427865088 2020-05-04 22:05:34 EDT <cephalopodeyes> @comcast  is still out 10 hours later. This is the third, and longest, multi-hour outage in two weeks. Make this right, @comcastcares @Xfinity #Davis
1257490887770177536 2020-05-04 22:02:45 EDT <BARBIE29472587> Dear Xfinity.  Thank you for being so damn not providing any internet. Now I know I‚Äôm paying a lot of money for nothing but stupid Xfinity.  I hope you‚Äôll change your mind to fix it properly not just for temporary.  #xfinity #outage
1257490689115525120 2020-05-04 22:01:57 EDT <WRCKTNGL> @Xfinity you guys seriously to figure out the internet outage in Green Valley Ranch right now, you‚Äôre messing with my evening. And messing with my evening is like messing with my emotions
1257487854332248064 2020-05-04 21:50:42 EDT <wvaught94> My wifi is in an outage area. Will I get credited on my monthly bill for nearly two days of not getting a service for which I pay for?
1257487049868955648 2020-05-04 21:47:30 EDT <unlsweetie> @Xfinity Any updates for GVR Denver outage? Is it still supposed to come back around 8? It's been a long 9 hrs without TV and internet service.
1257484074597351425 2020-05-04 21:35:40 EDT <SeemsLeJITT> @Xfinity my monthly bill is too expensive for y‚Äôall to keep having these outages
1257480351326371841 2020-05-04 21:20:53 EDT <GaryLeon1960> I have no phone service. Your chat center has power outages  pic.twitter.com/jmZxB3QJTd
1257475372817371136 2020-05-04 21:01:06 EDT <HammonMhammon> Does Xfinity mean outage?
1257474952917184512 2020-05-04 20:59:26 EDT <DavisClydesdale> @Xfinity What's up with the widespread outage in the Davis/Sacramento area of CA? Been out since 9:30ish am.
1257473645036941312 2020-05-04 20:54:14 EDT <John_Marshock9> No outages in my area but I‚Äôm receiving .77 Mbps from your server
1257473409795215366 2020-05-04 20:53:18 EDT <Xfinity> Hi John. Have you checked your My Account app to see if you're in an area outage?
1257469830690734083 2020-05-04 20:39:04 EDT <crimsontide81> I have tried 4 times to talk to an agent. I have no outages now and still no internet
1257468798325657607 2020-05-04 20:34:58 EDT <Ricky_wojo> Word is out that it is an upgrade related outage so they really could have let their customers know ahead of time and been better about communicating that their timelines are just (really rough) estimates instead of exact times like they made it sound
1257467876618850304 2020-05-04 20:31:19 EDT <CoreyMRyan> A second, day-long @Xfinity / @comcast outage has me shopping for new internet service.
1257466327289131010 2020-05-04 20:25:09 EDT <gweezlouise> if we can't have an accurate estimate, transparency about what's caused the outage would be nice. will this be a recurring issue? üò±
1257463977656942593 2020-05-04 20:15:49 EDT <_MoBella> @Xfinity when will my outage be over? This is terrible! I have been without internet service since 9:30am
1257463020848132096 2020-05-04 20:12:01 EDT <brjklein> @Xfinity second weekday 4+hr outage in a week. Kind of a problem... especially with no ETA on a fix now...
1257461779648729090 2020-05-04 20:07:05 EDT <aspiringfairie> it‚Äôs like they should have emergency planning or something ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. This is the second outage in Davis on a school day and I am so far behind in class. If I pay $40 a month for WiFi - I want it to work. They provide a service but aren‚Äôt doing a good job at following through
1257459080173674497 2020-05-04 19:56:21 EDT <kknsports> @Xfinity is ridiculous. Experienced an outage which started at noon today. It‚Äôs now six and still nothing......says on the website they hope to have things back by eight tonight....yeah right.
1257455975994478592 2020-05-04 19:44:01 EDT <Chinese_Coco> Really over this Xfinity outage üôÑ
1257455925008510976 2020-05-04 19:43:49 EDT <madmax2u> @comcast I've had an outage for over 24 hrs now at Mt Juliet. The outage info online keeps changing the fix timeline. There are others in the area in similar/worse situations. Is @Xfinity either paying for the lost time at work or discounting the internet cost for the month?
1257453141433384960 2020-05-04 19:32:45 EDT <eshortstop_> @xfinity internet outages happening repeatedly the week before finals SICK  pic.twitter.com/YkFxbZHeTn
1257453014086045704 2020-05-04 19:32:15 EDT <Always_151> During this pandemic @Xfinity have been sucking with these outages..every month it's an outage smh
1257452738759311360 2020-05-04 19:31:09 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked your My Account app to see if you're in an area outage?
1257448993094844418 2020-05-04 19:16:16 EDT <Xfinity> Hi, Shane! The app has the most up to date information in regard to outages. We can double check your area to see. Send us a DM here:  https://xfin.tv/support¬† üëà
1257446342118514693 2020-05-04 19:05:44 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Eric! If you're in an area outage, keep an eye on your My Account app for updates.
1257443055705169921 2020-05-04 18:52:41 EDT <leyesenia> There would be an xfinity outage the day I was planning to catch up on school work  pic.twitter.com/vrDKw9wvlf
1257436803717648385 2020-05-04 18:27:50 EDT <Xfinity> We're working to fix this ASAP. We apologize for this happening, you can send us a DM here:  https://xfin.tv/support¬† , and we can help with your bill due to this outage.
1257436496883265538 2020-05-04 18:26:37 EDT <oliviafranboja> @Xfinity internet isn‚Äôt working yet it says there are no outages in our area even though they‚Äôre all over the place üò≠ quarantine just got worse
1257436249125781506 2020-05-04 18:25:38 EDT <ShayHagerty> @Xfinity stop pushing back the time and resolve the service outage
1257436241047498752 2020-05-04 18:25:36 EDT <LarryTheWineGuy> @Xfinity Second major outage in less than a week. Why? Davis, California. All day so far.
1257436210898894850 2020-05-04 18:25:29 EDT <Notchhit65> I love internet outages what did i do for fun before the internet ?!?! Lol   "An XFINITY Internet outage has been reported in your area. We're working hard to get your service up and running. The issue will be resolved 05/04/2020 08:16 PM (Mountain). Thank you for your patience."
1257435634886742017 2020-05-04 18:23:12 EDT <RDunphy7> @Xfinity has been out all day and they keep pushing back the time the outage will end... thanks so much
1257433569238159361 2020-05-04 18:14:59 EDT <HeyMarquece> @Xfinity been down since 10 am. Longest WiFi outage I‚Äôve ever had. I‚Äôve had such a great service with y‚Äôall till now. Wtf?! I got work to do.
1257432047641071622 2020-05-04 18:08:56 EDT <Xfinity> Are you seeing any area outage related information in your My Account app?
1257430313669623809 2020-05-04 18:02:03 EDT <MentalAmmo> @Xfinity @comcast @comcastcares  all #Comcast services out ALL DAY at my home (zip 80249).   Kids missed online learning.   All day outage is unacceptable.  Why can‚Äôt I talk to an #agent #Xfinity hangs up before I‚Äôm done entering info.
1257428905281179653 2020-05-04 17:56:27 EDT <Xfinity> If you're signed up for alerts (which you can do at  https://comca.st/2W4xb9K¬† if not) you can get a text when the outage is restored.
1257427590693953539 2020-05-04 17:51:14 EDT <Xfinity> What's going on with your Wi-Fi? Are you in an area outage?
1257426570031104000 2020-05-04 17:47:10 EDT <hedahlke> Please @Xfinity, fix the #comcastoutage in Davis, CA ASAP. I already had to postpone my midterm last Thursday because of the 5/1 outage and don‚Äôt want to do this again tomorrow morning.
1257425464550924295 2020-05-04 17:42:47 EDT <Xfinity> We don't want you to experience this. Are you seeing any end time information on this outage in your My Account app?
1257423341545234433 2020-05-04 17:34:21 EDT <Sharat_Chander> Now @comcast @Xfinity recording says to expect service back up near 7:45pm.  XFi app not functioning during outage.  pic.twitter.com/hkWkUdaghJ
1257422684608217088 2020-05-04 17:31:44 EDT <olsArthur> 2 xfinity outages in a week.  nice.
1257421637974097928 2020-05-04 17:27:34 EDT <TLowePower> @comcast @Xfinity, this is the second day-long internet outage in a week.  This is unacceptable. Maybe I should just cancel and tether to my @googlefi account.
1257418919435960322 2020-05-04 17:16:46 EDT <seanpalmer> I have to find a new ISP. @Xfinity has gone out too much for an essential service you have to have when kids are schooling and everyone is working from home. Outages are just unacceptable right now.
1257417409062932484 2020-05-04 17:10:46 EDT <curiousmagpies> Well, the internet has been out all day, which was great given that I was supposed to host a writing retreat on Zoom. üôÉüôÉüôÉ Thankfully, an awesome colleague stepped in, but @Xfinity owes me a refund for all of these outages, damnit.
1257417048306733058 2020-05-04 17:09:20 EDT <ryanhorvath88> @comcastcares @Xfinity @comcast any update on when you are going to fix the outage that has afffected Nashville all day today??
1257411771343663104 2020-05-04 16:48:22 EDT <CameronAlex11> @Xfinity really be trying to make this online schooling difficult. The person on the chat support said we have had 96 hours of WiFi outage in the past week üôÉ
1257408913877528576 2020-05-04 16:37:01 EDT <Xfinity> We want to get you back up & running! Are you in an area outage currently?
1257406293318545410 2020-05-04 16:26:36 EDT <andreaicavazos> I called the customer service number and there is an outage in the area.
1257405730560376837 2020-05-04 16:24:22 EDT <Xfinity> What's going on with your connection? The Xfinity My Account app is a great first place to check. We're here to help if there isn't a reported outage or maintenance though, so reach back out!
1257403417900789763 2020-05-04 16:15:10 EDT <aimandel> @Xfinity outage map, only shows my house (ever) but 2,500+ customers on popup. That's a useless map, I know where my house is, but not who else is internetless... polygons/raster fill
1257398180150468608 2020-05-04 15:54:22 EDT <anandsaw> All those people advocating for changing the nature of the work place i.e., working more from home after we are done with covid19, clearly have never had the (dis)pleasure of having @Xfinity as their ISP. TWO (longterm) outages in the space of 5 days ü§¨
1257397403218558977 2020-05-04 15:51:16 EDT <ShayHagerty> @Xfinity outage here in nashville you said it would be resolved earlier today!! Still isnt!!
1257395773098115074 2020-05-04 15:44:48 EDT <Xfinity> Hi! What's going on with your connection? Are you in an area outage?
1257394939505377280 2020-05-04 15:41:29 EDT <aspiringfairie> hey @Xfinity @comcast, what are you going to do for all of the students still in Davis whose education you are hindering ? 2 outages in a 5days - you should be ashamed. The lack of preparation for emergencies is APPALLING but it‚Äôs not like it matters bc you have a monopoly ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1257393258143064066 2020-05-04 15:34:48 EDT <mareeayyy> Service outages
1257391577091145731 2020-05-04 15:28:07 EDT <mpbradfo> Hello- another outage and still no response from the DM or other support channels. Please help.
1257385132564103168 2020-05-04 15:02:31 EDT <Xfinity> We want to help. Have you been in an area outage during this time?
1257380234573361154 2020-05-04 14:43:03 EDT <CuppleOthoughts> @Xfinity outage in Nashville since 5pm yesterday. Your app said it would be fixed by 9:30 last night. Still going strong here with no service from you guys...
1257379916653514756 2020-05-04 14:41:47 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked your My Account app to see if there's an outage reported in your area?
1257378417928003585 2020-05-04 14:35:50 EDT <PTRandyCarter> Does any fricking body have a phone numbers to cancel  FN xfinity? 100 mile away intermittent outages tree limbs tripping the alarms for over Dam week. Nobody there to Watch, turn on the FN screen what the error code is displayed?
1257378157335851015 2020-05-04 14:34:48 EDT <Xfinity> We don't have control over delivery of electricity.  Are you experiencing power outages or just service outages?
1257377542543114242 2020-05-04 14:32:21 EDT <ReList8Guy> Great job Xfinity/Comcast! 3 kids attempting to e-learn and a Teacher trying to e-Teach from home and your overpriced Internet and Cable have been out the entire day! I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll pro-rate this outage off of my bill!
1257374753817583618 2020-05-04 14:21:16 EDT <AlyssaMFerrari> @Xfinity I love the multiple internet outages a week in Davis, CA. It‚Äôs impossible to get in contact with an agent, and the online ‚Äúassistant‚Äù only resets my phone browser. The person running the Twitter has nothing to do with it so I won‚Äôt be rude but I‚Äôm angry to say the least
1257373721939099648 2020-05-04 14:17:10 EDT <MonroyMirian> Bruh ANOTHER internet outage in less than a week @Xfinity what the fuck do I pay you for?
1257372867601334273 2020-05-04 14:13:47 EDT <BeckNaftel1> Yes! Action Coffee still happened this morning despite a widespread @Xfinity outage that had us zooming in by phone to call @SenFeinstein @SenKamalaHarris & @RepGaramendi to demand Congress #ProtectOurVote in the next Covid relief bill. üí™üèº‚ù§Ô∏è #NeverthelessShePersisted
1257372681596436482 2020-05-04 14:13:02 EDT <mareeayyy> Omg I hate @Xfinity   You really had to have two power outages on a MONDAY ü§¨#getittogether
1257369925737381888 2020-05-04 14:02:05 EDT <Ee_Doherty> Working from home is hard enough without an @Xfinity outage every other day! No cell service either so I‚Äôm leaving the house to check my email.

1257358383994281985 2020-05-04 13:16:13 EDT <msashleighlove> xfinity and these outages know we're stuck inside... it's become a weekly thing in my neighborhood, and i have a business to run, here.. üòí at&t just gets me for my data, because i don't even realize when my wifi isn't working until i decide to turn on the tv.
1257358274103595009 2020-05-04 13:15:47 EDT <llonibell> @Xfinity 3rd work day in a row of WiFi outage! My kids have missed more all their classes since Th. & my husband is a prof. & he has students all over the world. Why did our bill go up by $50 for more outages?
1257354951833116673 2020-05-04 13:02:35 EDT <BThomasMendez> Xfinity really telling me the outage won‚Äôt be fixed for another 3 hours
1257354410738487303 2020-05-04 13:00:26 EDT <Larryferlazzo> Come on @Xfinity , two major and lengthy  Internet outages over four days in the city of Davis, CA does not help teachers and students who are trying to teach and learn!
1257352908942835715 2020-05-04 12:54:28 EDT <zreagh> .@comcast @Xfinity I‚Äôve been experiencing hours-long internet service outages 2-3 days per week during working hours for about a month now. I get that everyone working from home has complicated things, but I‚Äôm starting to feel not so great about paying my full monthly bill.
1257352218401026050 2020-05-04 12:51:43 EDT <chubbiebunz> May the 4th to be with you!!   Another Xfinity outage in Davis lol luckily some of my colleagues and students have hotspot too  pic.twitter.com/Epu1npPRYe

1257348766560137217 2020-05-04 12:38:01 EDT <KIGFletcher> Another day, another Xfinity outage. Reckon it will be fixed by 1:30 pm... Looks like I will be spending the morning running and reading. #WFH
1257347721918283776 2020-05-04 12:33:51 EDT <Flowmyhero> Internet outage? Seriously? @Xfinity @comcastcares
1257346389073412105 2020-05-04 12:28:34 EDT <larryjune_> How xfinity gonna have an outage right before an exam
1257340775899242498 2020-05-04 12:06:15 EDT <Bama_Wild_> Dang! I have Xfinity. Rebooting everything didn‚Äôt help. When I checked my app it said outage reported.
1257336846645964802 2020-05-04 11:50:39 EDT <fattweet> @Xfinity @comcastcares @comcast  So on Comcast support site it says "No Outages or Service Issues in my area". But I have been calling for a week about our outage and my neighbors all have outages. What's the deal?
1257333411540348934 2020-05-04 11:37:00 EDT <evansx4> @Xfinity Will we be getting a credit to our account for your outage?
1257330152494653440 2020-05-04 11:24:03 EDT <TruBluDad> @Xfinity there‚Äôs an outage in my area, when will it be resolved?
1257325014241722369 2020-05-04 11:03:38 EDT <Xfinity> Hey Randy. Is the My Account app showing any outages in your area?
1257321053015031814 2020-05-04 10:47:53 EDT <holypujoles> Hey @Xfinity how do we get a prorated refund for the money we pay you when there are outages? I‚Äôm paying more to have sufficient upload speed to work from home but there‚Äôs an extended outage that makes that impossible. I want my money back.
1257320120612876288 2020-05-04 10:44:11 EDT <just_jasmen> Still w/o WiFi.  @Xfinity promised the outage would be resolved by 9:18. It‚Äôs past that deadline and I have telecommute duties.  https://twitter.com/just_jasmen/status/1257135953568845829¬†‚Ä¶
1257311533144526849 2020-05-04 10:10:03 EDT <whitwhit78> Anytime you‚Äôd like to update why we still have an outage due to supposed maintenance would be great @Xfinity Terrible time for this considering people are home and relying on internet.
1257311531391258629 2020-05-04 10:10:03 EDT <SMMxo_> fcking xfinity and their service outages üôÑ ima just go back to sleep

1257309120153059328 2020-05-04 10:00:28 EDT <jakeamazza> Not only is there an @Xfinity outage in my area of Nashville (which they said would be resolved before 7 AM today, it's now 9 AM), but my cell service @VZWSupport is totally touch and go.

1257296677536489473 2020-05-04 09:11:02 EDT <comcast> Hey Rose. We know how important reliable service is to you, now more than ever. We are taking a number of steps to ensure you remain connected to your Xfinity services. Keep checking the My Account app for any outage updates. -Taja

1257263070675709953 2020-05-04 06:57:29 EDT <ReddQt703> Xfinity will have a random outage in the middle of the night and have you checking cables like some gremlin comes through and loosens em .
1257260264556318720 2020-05-04 06:46:20 EDT <martyduren> @Xfinity Best way to report a service outage?
1257234788223762433 2020-05-04 05:05:06 EDT <jonathanmedena> i‚Äôve been trying to play playstation for an hour and a half, but @Xfinity wants have an outage....
1257229669167820800 2020-05-04 04:44:45 EDT <WhooCaresReally> @Xfinity why do you guys have "routine maintenance" that causes outages multiple times a week? It's absurd.
1257208735749091328 2020-05-04 03:21:35 EDT <Leauxkey404> @Xfinity count y‚Äôall fuckin days! Damn Internet outages are ridiculous smh
1257147316793999360 2020-05-03 23:17:31 EDT <TheInfamousMarv> @Xfinity on bullshit cuz I wanna watch Insecure but we got the 3rd outage in 5 days
1257126202055241738 2020-05-03 21:53:37 EDT <Breshonnnn> @Xfinity I‚Äôm having too many outages , I‚Äôm finna switch on y‚Äôall ass

1257113919723720709 2020-05-03 21:04:49 EDT <anotherschwab> I had the @Xfinity cart ready to go, if this thing goes down again, it's a done deal. Can't take another outage.   But, so far, so good. Been up since y-day. (knock on wood).
1257113562268532743 2020-05-03 21:03:23 EDT <cesarro62544802> @Xfinity any chance to fix the outage in hermitage Tn before this
1257101509403295745 2020-05-03 20:15:30 EDT <jasminwitch> @Xfinity outage that wont be fixed for another 4 HOURS but there's a lot of centers and technicians around here. how come? did they all just get laid off??? :/
1257101494131834888 2020-05-03 20:15:26 EDT <kenixfan> @Xfinity outage here. happens at least once a week.
1257101145262227458 2020-05-03 20:14:03 EDT <HeelChad> Cmon @Xfinity what‚Äôs going on with the outages üò≠ #UpsetCustomer
1257088853728346112 2020-05-03 19:25:12 EDT <PFirestormz> What‚Äôs going on with @Xfinity internet?  Intermittent outages the past 2 days
1257071608382046208 2020-05-03 18:16:41 EDT <Xfinity> Hey. If there's an outage in your area, your My Account app will show any interruptions.
1257016793585025024 2020-05-03 14:38:52 EDT <collegeappspec> @Xfinity telling me there's an outage 3 streets down but not at my address when nothing is working is ludicrous.  https://twitter.com/hard2xplain/status/1257014839244972035¬†‚Ä¶
1257001752047616000 2020-05-03 13:39:06 EDT <dustinpettit> Made it 6 weeks into quarantine before an internet outage; probably better than most... but come on, @Xfinity - it‚Äôs HBO/Showtime catch up day.
1256995385974951936 2020-05-03 13:13:48 EDT <HI_IMTROUBLE> Xfinity bout to piss me off my internet been off all morning they said the outage would be fixed by 8 üôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑ
1256965636732997635 2020-05-03 11:15:35 EDT <Ebbi_Lena> Xfinity been having outages in my area all week wtf
1256950157654085635 2020-05-03 10:14:05 EDT <hasentweet> @comcast @Xfinity internet and tv area outage last night. I get a text saying outage is over and service is restored. It has not been restored. I‚Äôm being told Tuesday afternoon is earliest available. Does 72 hours seem like a reasonable response time for complete outage?
1256916758134509569 2020-05-03 08:01:22 EDT <MLG_Mahal> Bro I have an online exam tomorrow at 6 pm and we‚Äôve had internet outages everyday for the past 3 days...PLEASE FIX IT @comcastcares @Xfinity @comcast
1256845406912249859 2020-05-03 03:17:50 EDT <carq16> Well... #comcast nothing ‚Äúintermittent‚Äù about this last outage. No #xfinity since sometime before 7:20 am yesterday. 4/6-4/19 was ‚Äúintermittent‚Äù. 4/20-5/1 down daily during work hours. 5/2-now just down. So over it! #makeitright
1256811606765457409 2020-05-03 01:03:32 EDT <breallen_> @Xfinity I live alone. I‚Äôm tired of these daily outages. Hulu is the only thing keeping me sane.
1256807218843807745 2020-05-03 00:46:05 EDT <Airmobilemike> Hey @Xfinity think we can go a day or longer without losing connection?  Since Wednesday this week our internet and cable drop at 4:30 pm.  Today it didn't and we thought maybe they fixed it, but alas at 6:30 pm it started dropping again.  And your site says no outages?  Lies
1256755138901028866 2020-05-02 21:19:09 EDT <tapenal> @Xfinity it‚Äôs time to reduce my monthly payments based on this power outage in sf
1256752009484529664 2020-05-02 21:06:43 EDT <ArasCW> @comcastcares your @xfinity cust srv ppl have dropped my call twice while troubleshooting internet outage. Why not call me back instead of me going on hold for an hour!? #ihatecomcast
1256746495010734080 2020-05-02 20:44:48 EDT <Mobius22_> @Xfinity thanks for the outage when my wife is teaching an online class.  Worthless
1256728761015259136 2020-05-02 19:34:20 EDT <NoShortandshy14> I have no internet or tv too and apparently there is an outage for maintenance work which they should not be doing during the day. I need to know when this will be fixed?
1256724345864388609 2020-05-02 19:16:47 EDT <NoShortandshy14> @Xfinity I need to speak to someone and Xfinity/ Comcast just hung up on me . This outage is unacceptable and I want a credit in my account! @GavinNewsom
1256705106688520199 2020-05-02 18:00:20 EDT <904hops> @Xfinity is this some sort of sick joke you are playing? People are stuck at home and rely on the internet for work so you have 14 hour outages once a day? #comcastoutage #xfinityoutage
1256698382866931719 2020-05-02 17:33:37 EDT <jennnheld> Hopefully soon! Just now available in the part of Fishers I‚Äôm in. Working from home was impossible with @Xfinity Outages at least once a week with zero explanation.
1256684172162355200 2020-05-02 16:37:09 EDT <TnSpace> Huge kudos to @xfinity @comcast for getting me back up with internet in less than 24 hours as @WOW_WAY @Wowcare is on day 3 of an outage...
1256661908100276224 2020-05-02 15:08:41 EDT <NoShortandshy14> @Xfinity why is there an outage in my neighborhood?
1256641009372495873 2020-05-02 13:45:38 EDT <KailiaAngel> Xfinity, get y'all shit together.  You choose a Saturday to have an outage and take forever to fix it? Wtf..
1256635503434219522 2020-05-02 13:23:45 EDT <angvadel> @Xfinity So do I get a refund if there is an outage in my area?? I'm suppose to be giving a final exam and this is hurting my students.
1256565152322932736 2020-05-02 08:44:12 EDT <gnzlz_kait> I have Comcast/Xfinity and had a power outage at 4:15 in New Jersey. I wasn‚Äôt using my computer but had to cook in the dark for about 2 hours. Couldn‚Äôt find my torches!
1256484036224208897 2020-05-02 03:21:53 EDT <madcaps> @PoPville any word when @Xfinity services will return to Woodley Park area? Initial outage notification stated coverage would be restored by 12:25AM. At 12:26AM, revised update estimated 4:20AM. Also included a map, displaying outage widespread across the DMV.  What's the word?
1256458365728849920 2020-05-02 01:39:52 EDT <LSMroz> Hey @Xfinity internet has been going down randomly over the last 3 day. Down again now for longest stretch. Any outages happening?
1256451999056326662 2020-05-02 01:14:34 EDT <kleggy> Stuck inside the house and there‚Äôs a damn @Xfinity outage. And not just internet‚Ä¶ but cable, too. Time for some good old fashioned reading.

1256433623940513794 2020-05-02 00:01:34 EDT <AndyKHLiu> damn near every other day an outage @Xfinity
1256420915837091841 2020-05-01 23:11:04 EDT <VadeInPace> @Xfinity @comcast  Uh, I've checked my wires,  restarted my modem twice,  and zip. Little help here?  There was an outage yesterday,  it's not beyond the realm of possibility that there's one today.
1256409063874875393 2020-05-01 22:23:58 EDT <not_Sarah_Green> Website says outage until 12:26am
1256402643062272000 2020-05-01 21:58:27 EDT <Xfinity> I totally understand. It's frustrating when services aren't working properly. I'd watch:  https://comca.st/2Yprk0l¬† for when you're on WiFi and download the app so you can reboot, troubleshoot and be in the know for any planned maintenance or outage updates.
1256381655683682304 2020-05-01 20:35:03 EDT <carq16> 12 hours and counting for today‚Äôs #xfinity outage. And I‚Äôm paying for this #comcast #makeitright
1256355074714021890 2020-05-01 18:49:26 EDT <SheKills10> Yes. There‚Äôs no outage and it says my account is active and fine but for some reason the internet isn‚Äôt working. I reset the modem and router and still no connection to the internet for some reason
1256354145101058050 2020-05-01 18:45:44 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked the Xfinity My Account app to see if there was an outage in the area?
1256350023610183681 2020-05-01 18:29:22 EDT <MariaFraschilla> I‚Äôve restarted it on multiple different occasions, waiting 30 seconds to 5 minutes before turning it on again, checking for outages.
1256349074732785665 2020-05-01 18:25:35 EDT <iTzNADiA> @Xfinity would hve a outage while I‚Äôm working from home üôÑüò©
1256345290577031168 2020-05-01 18:10:33 EDT <adnohr77> Super rude to have a service outage when we're all stuck at home, Xfinity
1256343966582280202 2020-05-01 18:05:18 EDT <vrmartin> Help me understand. I am texting ‚ÄúOUTAGE‚Äù to #Comcast #xFinity because I want a status update. The response tells me to go to the website. If I could go to the website, I wouldn‚Äôt need a status update.  pic.twitter.com/dgYrVcsDle
1256337491096817665 2020-05-01 17:39:34 EDT <hiimynameisron> Shout out Xfinity for the outages today.  pic.twitter.com/dsXChFaV28
1256329729151397888 2020-05-01 17:08:43 EDT <_itwasntSHAY> @Xfinity is the worst isp I‚Äôve ever had. Planned outages without warning during the workday is not ok. Even more so now that we have no where else to go to do work.
1256325105291915266 2020-05-01 16:50:21 EDT <Trucktub> Jfc Xfinity is asshole.  8 min into stream and it drops. Now there‚Äôs an outage. I understand shit happens, but when my shit is constantly dropping and DCing, I have no patience.   God damnitttt
1256323445530349568 2020-05-01 16:43:45 EDT <rishabkdoshi> 2nd internet outage in 3 days. DISAPPOINTED @Xfinity @comcast  . Had to drop out of meetings because of this!
1256307383720046593 2020-05-01 15:39:55 EDT <ChristieFanning> @Xfinity My service has been having outages EVERY SINGLE DAY this week. I am working from home and need the internet to work. Then when you call in you cannot get a rep. I have had about 5-6 hours of internet outages this week. Somebody needs to credit our accountüò°üò°üò°
1256307277641875456 2020-05-01 15:39:30 EDT <Uno_Dos_Tre3> are there service outages in the bay area? we have had poor/inconsistent connection all week
1256305808603787264 2020-05-01 15:33:40 EDT <Xfinity> What's going on with your service? Are you seeing any outage information showing in your My Account app?
1256302668051603457 2020-05-01 15:21:11 EDT <charleythedon> Ion understand why tf xfinity always got an outage by my house!
1256301570972581888 2020-05-01 15:16:50 EDT <CantankerusFemi> Yes there is an outage till 5:24
1256297297144696833 2020-05-01 14:59:51 EDT <Xfinity> Have you tried doing a System Refresh or checking the Xfinity My Account app to see if there was an outage in the area?
1256291184005308420 2020-05-01 14:35:33 EDT <Xfinity> The My Account app is great to have. You can pay your bill, view outage information, troubleshoot your connection and so much more. It can be downloaded here:  http://comca.st/35nrxmd¬†
1256289237261041671 2020-05-01 14:27:49 EDT <PetesNet> Still no service.  What is the issue?  My Account app showed no service outages in my area, and the customer service phone rep ran a diagnostic and said the problem is not in or connecting to my house.
1256279104023924736 2020-05-01 13:47:33 EDT <CesarVelez4> Well look at that, now it‚Äôs the 4th day in a row with outage issues and now I‚Äôve been on the phone with Xfinity for over an hour waiting for someone to actually help me out. You never responded to the several DM messages you asked me to send you and my service is still down!!!  pic.twitter.com/n51NeIxw0Y
1256278428409573392 2020-05-01 13:44:52 EDT <Datvulcha> IT NOT WORKINGGGGGGG üó£üó£üó£  For 2 straight days there‚Äôs been an outage!  And you guys keep pushing the time on when it‚Äôs supposed to be back!!
1256277029067960320 2020-05-01 13:39:18 EDT <robdaniel99> Funny how right after I pay my bill, there's an Internet outage with @Xfinity . No wonder I'm about ready to drop this company like a bad habit. #internet #badservice
1256272247322378240 2020-05-01 13:20:18 EDT <Sommer> @Xfinity it‚Äôs after 10am on a work day and this outage continues. No updates. When can we expect internet back?  pic.twitter.com/Fm8wGbDqfv
1256269272315301889 2020-05-01 13:08:29 EDT <SahFiji> Xfinity gets an outage everyday bruh ü§®
1256262293135990792 2020-05-01 12:40:45 EDT <jjjgrubbs> @Xfinity @comcast It is complete crap that during this time when so many are working and schooling online that there are so many unannounced outages.
1256253272580657153 2020-05-01 12:04:54 EDT <clawds_> I‚Äôve had a comcast outage everysingle day for the past 4 days in a row...who‚Äôs ass I gotta beat? @Xfinity
1256248384089985025 2020-05-01 11:45:29 EDT <Xfinity> We know these outages are frustrating, we apologize for the inconvenience this has caused. Are you in an outage currently?
1256246903689396225 2020-05-01 11:39:36 EDT <BLUEVET1776> @comcast @Xfinity can't seem to get their act together. Regular outages and lost work from home.
1256234816699346944 2020-05-01 10:51:34 EDT <Xfinity> We're sorry for the inconvenience the interruption caused, and our techs are working to get everything restored asap. Be sure to monitor the Xfinity My Account app for updates on the outage.
1256234510095654915 2020-05-01 10:50:21 EDT <ragoisawesome> @Xfinity @comcast  has truly has the worst customer service ever!! I have been dealing with extremely slow internet and outages for months now with no help from xfinity/Comcast. but yet they still charge me the full bill.  Simply ridiculous
1256233833533509633 2020-05-01 10:47:40 EDT <imamericancer> There are outages. And I missed a work meeting because of it.
1256233639496556544 2020-05-01 10:46:54 EDT <mlattanze1199> @Xfinity what's up with all these outages? I lost all my work because EVERYTHING went down! üò°
1256232196521840644 2020-05-01 10:41:09 EDT <Xfinity> We would hate to see you go, and we apologize for the issues you've been running into. Let's look into how we can help with your bill due to these outages. Send us a DM here:  https://xfin.tv/support¬† üëà
1256208257347129345 2020-05-01 09:06:02 EDT <Xfinity> If you are part of an area- wide outage you can find updates and track your service through the My Account app.
1256208082893488132 2020-05-01 09:05:20 EDT <Isthat_LadyDi> No online it always says there's no outages in my area. This started as soon as I had to work from home full time due to covid-19.
1256203717650583552 2020-05-01 08:48:00 EDT <Xfinity> We want to help. Have you been experiencing outages in your area? Have you seen anything in your My Account app?
1256200999703904258 2020-05-01 08:37:12 EDT <Xfinity> Hey Daren. Is there an area outage reported on your My Account app?
1256193037304291328 2020-05-01 08:05:33 EDT <Royfiz> Imagine working from home and your @Xfinity internet has an outage 3 days in a row middle of the afternoon
1256190067460247557 2020-05-01 07:53:45 EDT <suefied> @Xfinity what‚Äôs up with the outages in Holmdel no
1256159718575353857 2020-05-01 05:53:09 EDT <l3lackedxOut> @Xfinity @comcast really needs to step up the services In my area 4th outage tonight for no reason. I'm depressed enough come on lol.. üò∑
1256149321000587269 2020-05-01 05:11:50 EDT <simondowd78> @virginmedia been having outages here in the UK the last few days 5g maybe?
1256114092353490944 2020-05-01 02:51:51 EDT <thereelbdm> Internet is down, I get that, Xfinity says it‚Äôs maintenance in my area, but why won‚Äôt my TVs let me change the channel? Lol. No matter what button I use on the remote I get this message, makes no sense why I can‚Äôt use my cable during an internet outage @comcastcares üòÇ pic.twitter.com/zFQVrVVuTP
1256090111948791808 2020-05-01 01:16:34 EDT <KenZL> My favorite thing about Comcast is when they do routine maintenance that might cause an outage, they don‚Äôt tell you until an hour after the outage. @Xfinity @comcast @comcastcares
1256072039905079299 2020-05-01 00:04:45 EDT <CoxRyan89> Is there an outage in Lake County? Cable/Internet went out. @Xfinity
1256070569461719041 2020-04-30 23:58:55 EDT <VU_rise_grind> I can not wait to drop @Xfinity. There are constant outages and I have never received a credit, even after the tornado. Every company that provides a service to me has offered help through everything except Comcast.
1256061809141956610 2020-04-30 23:24:06 EDT <Xfinity> Hi. You can use the Xfinity My Account and xFi apps to troubleshoot common internet issues or check to see if there is an outage reported for your area. Still need help? Use  https://xfin.tv/support¬† to send a message with your account number and details of the issue.
1256051233867157508 2020-04-30 22:42:05 EDT <sarmorri> Dear @Xfinity our cable and internet are cutting in and out. Any chance this will be fixed by morning?  #remotework #PleaseHelp #outage
1256035774060998657 2020-04-30 21:40:39 EDT <Xfinity> Hi! Are you seeing an indication of an outage in the Xfinity My Account app? The app will provide information on the expected time to repair. Rest assured our crews are working to get you back up as soon as possible! We appreciate your patience.
1256027684993261569 2020-04-30 21:08:30 EDT <TColoradan> @Xfinity @comcast you seriously are going to have an 8 hour outage on a Thursday night during quarantine? Come on!!
1256026178810454018 2020-04-30 21:02:31 EDT <taydigs44> Dude I was going to add some today but @Xfinity outages were a blocker. Got sidetracked. Will take a listen once I have reliable inet again.
1256022778517561344 2020-04-30 20:49:00 EDT <taydigs44> Comcast/Xfinity, we're on outage #6 today. I cannot be more impressed with your ability to hire incompetent technicians.
1255995136821125120 2020-04-30 18:59:10 EDT <MURXTER> Internet went out. Came back online hours later. Shows outages in area. Internet speeds are a lot slower than normal and all over the board. Awesome being a streamer and having internet from @comcast/@Xfinity - Thanks guys. I may or may not be streaming tonight. We‚Äôll see!  pic.twitter.com/lz3zgd2P8V
1255975319682646021 2020-04-30 17:40:25 EDT <taydigs44> Two extended outages in one day. You're crushing it @Xfinity
1255970179177238528 2020-04-30 17:20:00 EDT <mrsdisababy> Had xfinity for like 4 years and never had a service outage. Been with AT&T like 7 months and since I‚Äôve been working from home I‚Äôve had 2 service outages with AT&T in the last 30 days. I‚Äôm working from home and I‚Äôm ready to throw them away
1255958439135674368 2020-04-30 16:33:21 EDT <dkblattneratty> @Xfinity it‚Äôs been a wasted day due to internet outages in #FTLauderdale. Supposed to be repaired by 11:15. Nope. Can‚Äôt talk to a live person on the phone. Chat feature horrible when you don‚Äôt have internet!
1255958307396780043 2020-04-30 16:32:49 EDT <JerseySwamp> @Xfinity another outage in Cumberland County, NJ!  Any chance you can fix it soon?
1255956217249349633 2020-04-30 16:24:31 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Elise. Is there an area outage reported in your My Account app?
1255934006836822016 2020-04-30 14:56:16 EDT <iMikeLav> Complete service outage. As in literally the cable going to my house was cut
1255924248029216770 2020-04-30 14:17:29 EDT <JohnKuhnleinEsq> @CoxHelp Some liar at Cox named Jolene called yesterday to say that Cox would have the network running at--get this--10:18 last night. Are they making bets at Cox as to who can give the most ridiculous answer possible for their nationwide outage? The winner gets Xfinity service?
1255915214039588870 2020-04-30 13:41:35 EDT <DevinSHunter> We had outages on Xfinity in Indy. Anyone else?  https://twitter.com/X22Report/status/1255661638029578241¬†‚Ä¶
1255915209476190209 2020-04-30 13:41:34 EDT <Xfinity> You can keep track on outage updates through the Xfinity My Account app.
1255912353511739396 2020-04-30 13:30:13 EDT <thmpsnii> Bruh, people have work. Wtf is going on with this outage @Xfinity
1255911416692948994 2020-04-30 13:26:30 EDT <Xfinity> We understand this is very frustrating, are you seeing an end time for this outage in your My Account app?
1255911103151968257 2020-04-30 13:25:15 EDT <NeilHanlon> I don't know whether to be upset or amused at the "Abrupt System Enhancement" (read: Unplanned Outage) that @Xfinity is having right now all over Cambridge and Somerville. cc @comcastcares, @UpgradeCambMA
1255910550573326337 2020-04-30 13:23:03 EDT <Rshapiro84> Seems silly for @Xfinity to upgrade their neighborhood Systems and cause outages during the week when people are working from home. Why not wait for the weekend? Hope this gets fixed soon!
1255908323116773376 2020-04-30 13:14:12 EDT <BayAreaGooner88> That‚Äôs not acceptable to us. 5 outages in 14 days? We‚Äôre supposed to pay for a service we are not receiving??
1255907251090415616 2020-04-30 13:09:56 EDT <BayAreaGooner88> We want to speak to someone about how you plan to rectify this rather than just having automated messages tell us there is an outage and hanging up.
1255907186779144195 2020-04-30 13:09:41 EDT <moontaeyeol> there‚Äôs a city wide internet outage on my busiest day for classes lol thanks @Xfinity
1255906958017609728 2020-04-30 13:08:47 EDT <BayAreaGooner88> We‚Äôve had about 5-6 outages the last 2 weeks. Our work is internet dependent and we have a child that has therapy sessions online all day long that we are both missing and being billed for. The outage timetable keeps getting pushed back as well. Beyond frustrating to pay for this
1255905475025084422 2020-04-30 13:02:53 EDT <AshBG> Total internet, tv, landline @Xfinity outage for hours now üòû Hard to work from home and provide for my family without a service I pay for... Hopefully it is restored sooner than the expected time! @ComcastCares
1255905036539813888 2020-04-30 13:01:08 EDT <Larryferlazzo> Lesson learned today- if @Xfinity has a major outage in my area, I should NOT try to teach my live online ELL class with my cellphone connection. It did, however give me a sense of what it‚Äôs been like for my students to access our lessons using data from their phones
1255904595961769984 2020-04-30 12:59:23 EDT <Kat29kat29> @Xfinity outage AGAIN!!! Why does this happen so often?!?!  How can I #workfromhome
1255903369966891010 2020-04-30 12:54:31 EDT <RealKiaraAlexis> Xfinity would have an outage right now like üò© @Xfinity pls get my internet back up and working
1255902391775358976 2020-04-30 12:50:38 EDT <Sean_SF> #Comcast #XFINITY internet is down now? I don't have access last 15 mins or so. #bayarea #outage
1255902339614957568 2020-04-30 12:50:25 EDT <chubbiebunz> There‚Äôs an wide range internet outage for Xfinity at Davis. So...my early morning meetings are most likely cancelled...üò¨ I can go back to sleep!!!  pic.twitter.com/ERxPFmUu4c
1255901062600495107 2020-04-30 12:45:21 EDT <Xfinity> Is there an area outage reported in your My Account app?
1255900019670093830 2020-04-30 12:41:12 EDT <Xfinity> We know this is frustrating, we're working to fix this ASAP. You can check your My Account app for any outage info.
1255898159060041730 2020-04-30 12:33:49 EDT <RocBoi> great. üôÑ @Xfinity outage. why not proactively send out notifications to those effective. why did i have to call üò©
1255895821914013698 2020-04-30 12:24:32 EDT <yelowburd> @Xfinity it‚Äôs really not helpful to tell me check my app when you are showing my area as my old address I haven‚Äôt lived at in 6 months for outages. Still out with multiple router resets.
1255895011117457409 2020-04-30 12:21:18 EDT <danijohns91> Today is not the day I need Xfinity service outages.
1255894921636175877 2020-04-30 12:20:57 EDT <Xfinity> We can help out with your bill due to these outages. Send us a DM here:  https://xfin.tv/support¬† üëà
1255892093597298690 2020-04-30 12:09:43 EDT <Xfinity> We want to look into this. Are you seeing any area outage info showing in your My Account app?
1255891409560895488 2020-04-30 12:07:00 EDT <Godzilla_ace> Outage for like 2-3 hours. Cable was frozen, and internet wasn‚Äôt working. We good now
1255887796318937091 2020-04-30 11:52:38 EDT <directoradrian_> bruh xfinity is going through a nationwide wifi outage right before i have my last final...
1255887655025467395 2020-04-30 11:52:04 EDT <naterbater1005> Rip! I have no tv or internet üò≠ there‚Äôs an outage in my area and Xfinity says it won‚Äôt be fixed until approximately 2:30 pm could be way sooner could be after
1255885915290955778 2020-04-30 11:45:10 EDT <sehelles> Not the best time for a city-wide Xfinity outage üòë
1255884666374062081 2020-04-30 11:40:12 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked the My Account app to see if there's an outage reported in your area?
1255884576012066821 2020-04-30 11:39:50 EDT <otw_slick> Dawg @Xfinity I‚Äôm sick of y‚Äôall and these outages
1255880163281088512 2020-04-30 11:22:18 EDT <honeeycrisp> Woke up to a @Xfinity outage, won‚Äôt be restored until noon, and the kids both have 9:30 Google Classes ‚Äî Comcast has been one of the only bills I have that didn‚Äôt lower or help in any way during this crisis. Still paying full price for half ass service.
1255862333726961666 2020-04-30 10:11:27 EDT <CaniSlideNUrDMs> It‚Äôs an outage with your hotspot, I need to speak to a regular agent about something else.
1255861666127937542 2020-04-30 10:08:48 EDT <Xfinity> We'll get to you as soon as possible. Are you seeing any outage info showing in your My Account app?
1255861122864943105 2020-04-30 10:06:39 EDT <byfaith25> Ok. Thanks. The site said the same thing. I just called and a guy told me yes there is an outage since 8:30am. I told him my service was working at 8:30 and it went out at 9:56am. He placed me on hold and hasn‚Äôt come back yet. Smh
1255860638624161794 2020-04-30 10:04:43 EDT <PonyGinuwinemp3> No, IL. My app said there were no outages for a while too and then it updated saying there was an outage until 12
1255860389004353537 2020-04-30 10:03:44 EDT <byfaith25> Are you in Atlanta? I check the site and it says no outages so why is the service out? Bill is paid.
1255859538043056128 2020-04-30 10:00:21 EDT <byfaith25> @Xfinity Is there an outage in the 30033 area?
1255852794533289984 2020-04-30 09:33:33 EDT <Xfinity> We know this downtime is frustrating. We can help with your account in regard to outage credits. Send us a DM here:  https://xfin.tv/support¬† üëà
1255852178624917504 2020-04-30 09:31:06 EDT <PonyGinuwinemp3> @Xfinity your outages are preventing me from working from home! Are you crediting accounts for this??
1255849480529883137 2020-04-30 09:20:23 EDT <Rb_Dubs> Hey @comcast @Xfinity, can you fix the internet outage stat, please and thank you.
1255822284549480448 2020-04-30 07:32:19 EDT <KenzyLou__> Xfinity has too many outages for my liking wtf
1255743115731894279 2020-04-30 02:17:44 EDT <YuhhDeshawnn> I was trying to be productive and finish homework but bitch ass xfinity wanna have outages!
1255742834348642304 2020-04-30 02:16:36 EDT <LuckyRaven_> @xfinity you can send emails about everything else, why not about maintenance outages? You do know ppl are having to do online college exams and working from home...a heads-up would have been nice.
1255735705269161984 2020-04-30 01:48:17 EDT <Nyyah> In the middle of me trying to be a good student dumb ass xfinity has a power outage üôÑ
1255728434619330569 2020-04-30 01:19:23 EDT <Guccidownload> Anyone else have a internet outage with XFinity?
1255714068402487297 2020-04-30 00:22:18 EDT <mpbradfo> Hey! Haven‚Äôt heard back on my DM and we‚Äôre having yet another outage.
1255682612678590464 2020-04-29 22:17:18 EDT <ShylaMarie78> @Xfinity My Internet went out and there are no reported outages.  What is going on?
1255673432857088000 2020-04-29 21:40:50 EDT <SaltyZera> @Xfinity @comcast y‚Äôall are in top form this week. Just had my third consecutive internet outage in as many days. It‚Äôs impossible for my to make a living or enjoy what I do when I can‚Äôt rely on my internet to be a bit more stable than this. Mind explaining yourselves?
1255670441579966465 2020-04-29 21:28:57 EDT <Ivy_Gracexx> Sooo my @xfinity internet went out. I called & was informed there will be routine maintenance tomorrow morning from 12am-6am & also told they‚Äôre aware of an outage in my area that should be resolved by 10:12pm tonight. Sooo not sure about stream. üò´ please send shots I am so sad
1255644238391341056 2020-04-29 19:44:49 EDT <jordan_runyan> No, no service outages.
1255642027254931456 2020-04-29 19:36:02 EDT <Pyrelight2112> We left att many moons ago. I'm happy with everything Xfinity provides us. But whatever is going on now, has been going on a while. At least now they are reporting the outage. Curiously, they don't list the issue or an ETA. Like it's something out of the ordinary.
1255640777159565314 2020-04-29 19:31:04 EDT <melindagherman> @comcastcares  Re: Acct 8535114370746212, April 27, 2020 delivery of 3 Xfinity Pods  Michael Herman Called Xfinity to report pods caused WiFi outage on PC & iPhones. Told Xfinity customer service we want to RETURN Pods for refund.Employee said Xfinity stores are closed. No help.
1255598694948274176 2020-04-29 16:43:51 EDT <TSA_Toxxi> Hey @Xfinity @comcastcares I keep having issues with my internet. Please send help. There was an outage earlier in my area, which was resolved for about an hour. Now it says ‚Äúwe‚Äôre having trouble finding signal.‚Äù Ughhh
1255584053018759169 2020-04-29 15:45:40 EDT <bHAvInSOdhA> No outages reported in area.  Have restarted modem few times to troubleshoot & still no luck.
1255583976795840512 2020-04-29 15:45:22 EDT <Dirtysnipe4> It claims there are outages in the area but gives no other information to me
1255583116078481408 2020-04-29 15:41:57 EDT <Xfinity> We can help. Are you seeing any area outage information in your My Account app?
1255568904837050369 2020-04-29 14:45:28 EDT <Skye_MH> My internet has had three outages since working from home. Ended up just going back to the office before I get let go ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1255557164661260288 2020-04-29 13:58:49 EDT <Mrfredclay> What‚Äôs up with the internet?! Having service outages from both @Verizon & @Xfinity @comcast at the same time. This seems like DDoS attack outages rather than happenstance that both Verizon & Comcast are down at the same time. Who knows?
1255553407693328388 2020-04-29 13:43:54 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Sabrina. Does your My Account app indicate that you're in an area outage?
1255541749449195520 2020-04-29 12:57:34 EDT <poisonlizzie> So my question is directed at there being consistent outages in my area over the course of the last two weeks. I am wondering if there are any proactive measures being taken so that the internet can be reliable.
1255536629571358721 2020-04-29 12:37:13 EDT <HoldenWilen> @Xfinity @comcastcares moreover, you tell people to go online to check the status of the outage. You do realize the INTERNET is down right?
1255535909803524097 2020-04-29 12:34:22 EDT <HoldenWilen> Hey @Xfinity @comcastcares, your service is a joke. A major outage in Baltimore. In case you didn‚Äôt know, there‚Äôs a pandemic and people need internet. Your oddly specific times for when outages will be fixed are also infuriating because you think we‚Äôre dumb enough to believe you.
1255528810822479872 2020-04-29 12:06:09 EDT <Xfinity> Apologies for the interruption. If you're in an area outage, be sure to keep an eye on your My Account app for updates.
1255528172457730054 2020-04-29 12:03:37 EDT <Xfinity> We can look into this. Are you seeing any outage info in your My Account app?
1255526594145333250 2020-04-29 11:57:21 EDT <CesarVelez4> @Xfinity you advertise that you are here to have continued service yet we are experiencing outages and you are still sending a bill. This needs to be resolved ASAP, yesterday the service was restored at 6pm from 11am. We‚Äôll see how long it will take today
1255526195279659011 2020-04-29 11:55:46 EDT <CesarVelez4> @Xfinity this is the second day in a row with internet and cable outage... and it happens at the same time.... this is unacceptable. Internet is the only means for work and study in this times of crisis.
1255524631982866432 2020-04-29 11:49:33 EDT <Vinci_FN> @Xfinity 2 days in a row with internet outages. I can see from Twitter im not the only one. Get your shit together pls
1255523365902786562 2020-04-29 11:44:31 EDT <kcloud__> @Xfinity called you guys over 10 times this morning/last night and keep getting a message that there is an outage in my area and speaking with someone will not resolve it and I get hung up on! I‚Äôm trying to call about a different issue! Please contact me
1255522097864024064 2020-04-29 11:39:29 EDT <CesarVelez4> Really @Xfinity second day in a row and the outage happens at the same time?  pic.twitter.com/XzHXcPqsHY
1255519007056244737 2020-04-29 11:27:12 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Elizabeth. We understand how important it is to have reliable service, and we're sorry for the interruptions you have experienced. Does the My Account app currently list a service outage in your area?
1255515179598708738 2020-04-29 11:11:59 EDT <poisonlizzie> @Xfinity I have been having consistent outages in my area, what is your team doing about this?
1255515074262859777 2020-04-29 11:11:34 EDT <Xfinity> Hey. Have you checked your My Account app to see if there is an outage reported in your area?
1255511558865682432 2020-04-29 10:57:36 EDT <desilove> They said they were sending a signal to the modem & then everything dropped out. I have restarted the modem and router. There were issues listed on the map earlier but those have disappeared. I‚Äôm patient, was just trying to see what our bill credit for the outage would be
1255507393229848584 2020-04-29 10:41:03 EDT <tiffanybmorris> Hey @comcast @Xfinity @comcastcares this is the second day in a row you‚Äôve had an outage in my area. What is happening???

1255494413519917058 2020-04-29 09:49:28 EDT <Stoical127> @Xfinity WTF do you mean there‚Äôs an outage in the area? I‚Äôm working working from home people.

1255325640699654145 2020-04-28 22:38:50 EDT <sfoglemanTKE418> @Xfinity How long is this outage supposed to take? It was supposed to be cleared by 8:34. Now it says tomorrow at noon?! I don‚Äôt pay this money for no tv or internet

1255300433272340480 2020-04-28 20:58:40 EDT <fattweet> @Xfinity @comcastcares trying to work from home but connection keeps cutting out. No outages reported in area. Rebooted and reset router 20 times. I‚Äôm through.
1255296804406661120 2020-04-28 20:44:15 EDT <EVC62986> @Xfinity this 4 hour outage in Indiana is insane! Get it handled
1255292213870972930 2020-04-28 20:26:00 EDT <yvonnasays> Second time today @Xfinity has had an outage in my area after multiple days of service in my area leaving us without WiFi for hours at a time. Timing could not be worse.
1255284596368867328 2020-04-28 19:55:44 EDT <6sweetgirl> If you really were working 24/7 to help your customers you would have fixed the xfinitywifi public network outage in St. Paul MN by now.
1255284396791300097 2020-04-28 19:54:56 EDT <Crimicles> Sounds to me like you shouldn‚Äôt charge Clint any money this month with all those outages. How is a man supposed to do his work from home?
1255282183394246660 2020-04-28 19:46:09 EDT <JustinLarson1> @RCNconnects - finally gave up on #xfinity after the 10th outage in 30 days and made the switch - tech came out same day and was awesome. glad to be joining the family!

1255245358805979136 2020-04-28 17:19:49 EDT <SaimanLam> I'm so sick of @Xfinity and their outages. @ATT when's the fiber coming to my zip code. I miss it so much.
1255242357898907656 2020-04-28 17:07:54 EDT <tmclaughbos> Ended up being an Xfinity outage related to my building.
1255240425306238978 2020-04-28 17:00:13 EDT <AmberCadabra> I‚Äôve restarted the router as well as reset it. Moved it. Checked and rechecked cable connections. Checked speed on multiple devices. It seems better now after a really rocky morning. No outages reported but ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

1255221759353241601 2020-04-28 15:46:02 EDT <biviana_rodarte> I‚Äôve been having problems with my service all month! There‚Äôs an outage everyday just about, my internet is so slow and I have the fastest speed. I‚Äôm paying too much to not have good service. I‚Äôm considering terminating my service which sucks because I‚Äôve been a customer for years
1255220553075568647 2020-04-28 15:41:15 EDT <BakerD42> There are some outages in Piedmont according to your map but turns out my issue was specific. Squirrels. Why do cables taste so good to them?
1255216572689506304 2020-04-28 15:25:26 EDT <Xfinity> We can look into what's going on. Are you seeing any outages showing in your My Account app?
1255215897788272640 2020-04-28 15:22:45 EDT <ladydzra> Internet: *goes out* Xfinity: "What? Nah. Everything's fine. Just re-tighten your cables." Me: "My cables are fine. How can I report an outage?" Xfinity: "You can't. We're telling you: everything's fine." Internet: *still out* Xfinity: "Wanna sign up for our mobile service?"
1255211220375756800 2020-04-28 15:04:10 EDT <aloke_mahato> @comcast is barely usable today in Millbrae with total data loss for over an hour during peak office time and this is a continued trend over a month now. App shows outage in the area with no resolution, so talking to @comcastcares is useless. #comcast #comcastoutage #xfinity  pic.twitter.com/4RZ7skpoyl
1255208422074695682 2020-04-28 14:53:03 EDT <latilleon> I was thick with outages the last several weeks. At least they say it‚Äôs them and not you, unlike what I dealt with.
1255206514597527555 2020-04-28 14:45:28 EDT <vicariousdrama> Going through some things. There are multi-pronged outages for @comcast @Xfinity today. Not good. Not good for them.
1255203638659686406 2020-04-28 14:34:02 EDT <damiRubiks> I had an outage. I tried contacting anyone through the IVR by saying, ‚Äútechnical support‚Äù, ‚Äúoutage‚Äù, ‚Äúbilling‚Äù, ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù, etc and every time I was informed that customer service is closed and was provided hours to call back between. So, good job hiding the one CSR.
1255202619863248896 2020-04-28 14:29:59 EDT <WhoIsCoreyL> @Xfinity any ETA on fixing the outage in lower Michigan?
1255198600214261761 2020-04-28 14:14:01 EDT <Chrissy2Nicole> 2 weeks, my wifi keeps kicking me off of my main line to the home wifi. Today, I'm experiencing an outage
1255195570739781633 2020-04-28 14:01:59 EDT <canned_ham> Hey, @Xfinity is it all good or do I have an outage? The no internet in my home leads me to guess everything isn‚Äôt good.  pic.twitter.com/MfmBlf10Hg
1255193703469236226 2020-04-28 13:54:33 EDT <Xfinity> We can look into this. Are you seeing any outage info showing in your My Account app?

1255187476727160835 2020-04-28 13:29:49 EDT <HighxFemme> @Xfinity my job has NO care what so ever that there is a pandemic going on or service outages in the area. I need a new service ASAP
1255186761690411009 2020-04-28 13:26:58 EDT <Povlak> @comcast @Xfinity please fix your UI. I‚Äôm one box it all looks good then box right below service outage detected. Which is it. Please clean it up to be consistent.  pic.twitter.com/WJ6aLqSpxj

1255177793601785856 2020-04-28 12:51:20 EDT <Xfinity> If there's an outage reported in your area, keep your eye on the app for updates.

1255171651253211136 2020-04-28 12:26:56 EDT <Xfinity> We can take a look, what's showing in the outage map currently?
1255170978209861632 2020-04-28 12:24:15 EDT <BakerD42> Any outages in Oakland, Ca. Your service outage map is conflicting
1255169089695342593 2020-04-28 12:16:45 EDT <Kate_Save> Yeah there must still be an outage. Which is frustrating as it's been almost two hours now
1255167542391459841 2020-04-28 12:10:36 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked your My Account app to see if there's an outage reported?

1255146734231019526 2020-04-28 10:47:55 EDT <Xfinity> Does your app still indicate that you're in an outage? If so, is there a resolution time listed?
1255141152547733507 2020-04-28 10:25:44 EDT <mylyfesongz> Dear @Xfinity, I'm tying to work from home, but you're ruining that with the service outage that won't be restored for 4 hrs. Like wtf?!?!
1255139230885408773 2020-04-28 10:18:06 EDT <_MyLifeAsYanna> @Xfinity this is the second random outage, you guys have to do better especially with EVERYONE home & working from home. #xfinityoutage
1255133948667203584 2020-04-28 09:57:07 EDT <J5nB4l> Lately it feels like every week there is an outage in my area due to maintenance. #XFINITY what are you even doing?  pic.twitter.com/RR6kryih5q
1255129453119901696 2020-04-28 09:39:15 EDT <thefinalmonster> @comcast Xfinity internet goes down almost every day. When I call to inquire about the ongoing reliability issues, the phone system just tells me that a tech is already working on my outage therefore there is no need to speak with an agent. Then it hangs up on me. Help please?
1255127420807462917 2020-04-28 09:31:10 EDT <olivialieberman> No. No outage. This happens every single day multiple times a day. We do speed tests everyday and on average we have a speed of 11 and we pay for 200. We‚Äôre fed up. And yes we have restarted everything multiple times a day.
1255126592382271489 2020-04-28 09:27:53 EDT <Xfinity> We want to fix this issue, are you an area outage currently or see any area related issues showing in your My Account app?

1255112770787217409 2020-04-28 08:32:58 EDT <safetchick> @Xfinity is there a way to get advanced notice of scheduled outages?  I had a call at 5am that I couldn‚Äôt lead because you have routine maintenance scheduled till 6:30am. That would have been great to know.
1255064601651064835 2020-04-28 05:21:33 EDT <blairesided> Another day another @comcast @Xfinity outage. Now going on two weeks worth of outages since Christmas and yet I‚Äôm still billed in full. Why @comcastcares? Will I ever get uninterrupted service?
1255049045552160770 2020-04-28 04:19:44 EDT <BbExcaliber3> @Xfinity seriously an outage on a Tuesday morning? Come on guys. Xfinity down in NorCal. Please fix this crap

1254937066271621123 2020-04-27 20:54:46 EDT <PittStrong2> If nothing works and YOU CANT GET A HUMAN ON THE PHONE OR ABLE TO REPORT YOUR OUTAGE ...YOU MIGHT AS WELL CALL IT THE SAME THING. You guys suck at any type of customer loyalty and service.
1254936438581399553 2020-04-27 20:52:17 EDT <Xfinity> You can check outage information through the Xfinity My Account app.

1254899770310578176 2020-04-27 18:26:34 EDT <MarcusWSea> @Xfinity what‚Äôs with all the outages lately. You guys were solid for like the last year, but the past couple weeks you‚Äôve been going down every couple of days.
1254893709549867008 2020-04-27 18:02:29 EDT <Xfinity> Is there an outage in the area Roxy?
1254889943735959558 2020-04-27 17:47:31 EDT <Xfinity> Keep checking the My Account app for any outage updates. If you are still experiencing issues our support team can take a closer look at your service. Send us a message using this link here:  https://xfin.tv/support¬†.
1254885672093192201 2020-04-27 17:30:33 EDT <oliveirasrgm> Yeah, now it is saying there are outages, before it didn't
1254885389157924870 2020-04-27 17:29:26 EDT <oliveirasrgm> Yeah, now it is saying there are outages, before it didn't
1254884808016171011 2020-04-27 17:27:07 EDT <Loo0105> Anyone else having internet issues with their #Comcast? @Xfinity No outages.
1254870679603810304 2020-04-27 16:30:59 EDT <Xfinity> Are you seeing outage info in your My Account app?
1254867630097403905 2020-04-27 16:18:51 EDT <jcollinwhite> @Xfinity what is causing the outage in Atlanta ?!?
1254860692600926209 2020-04-27 15:51:17 EDT <XLtheScholar> Stuck in the crib now Xfinity say there are outages in my area and the wifi wont be back til 7? Lawd why
1254856627913551872 2020-04-27 15:35:08 EDT <maaar_ily> I need @Xfinity to do something about their spotty internet connection & the network outages here in Oakland. I am WFH and can‚Äôt do anything without internet!!!!! Fml. ü§¨
1254853438828994560 2020-04-27 15:22:28 EDT <thejboshow> Of course there‚Äôs an internet outage for two hours. We only depend on the internet for everything Smfh thanks @Xfinity
1254852419126771713 2020-04-27 15:18:25 EDT <Ajale__> Of course there would be an xfinity outage once I get my new phone
1254845997164847105 2020-04-27 14:52:54 EDT <bsalom> @comcast @xfinity second internet outage for us for the day.  I am getting increasingly frustrated by the level of service over the past week now and hoping for a resolution ASAP please.
1254845974742171651 2020-04-27 14:52:48 EDT <itsmejagger> @Xfinity outage. What‚Äôs new?
1254843455727173633 2020-04-27 14:42:48 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked the Xfinity My Account app to see if there was an outage in the area or planned maintenance occurring?
1254831857822240768 2020-04-27 13:56:43 EDT <the_mav_erick> @Xfinity says it take 4 hours to fix an outage.   In the middle of a Monday when everyone is teleworking.  pic.twitter.com/HwHzy98xgI
1254830576340742144 2020-04-27 13:51:37 EDT <Xfinity> You'd need the account number that's experiencing the issue in order to verify an outage.
1254827601954082816 2020-04-27 13:39:48 EDT <HikeoftheMenrys> Dammit @Xfinity, yet another service outage in my zip code and your website insists there‚Äôs no outage. Meanwhile, your FB messenger account is unresponsive so I can‚Äôt even report it properly. The day fiber optics come to my neighborhood I‚Äôm cutting the cord and never looking back
1254822580990758918 2020-04-27 13:19:51 EDT <Maybe_Im_Cody> No it doesn't. It also doesn't show anything online. However when I call your support line I am told that there is a technician in my area responding to an outage. I see on other websites that others in my area are also without internet yet your site remains without an update
1254818109208346625 2020-04-27 13:02:05 EDT <JoshuaMSimons> Fiber would be ideal. I have had minimal issues with xfinity, and admittedly, we pay extra for a good plan, but I can't recall ever having service outages in my neck of the woods
1254808168019963909 2020-04-27 12:22:35 EDT <Xfinity> We understand how frustrating service interruptions can be, and we're sorry for the inconvenience. Does the My Account app list an area outage when you notice the service is down?
1254807638619099136 2020-04-27 12:20:28 EDT <Xfinity> Is there an outage indicated in your area? If so, keep an eye on the app for updates.
1254806706971803656 2020-04-27 12:16:46 EDT <jonathangosper> @TMobileHelp How much hotspot allowance do I have for the month? Silly @Xfinity decided to have an internet outage on a Monday.
1254805495883476992 2020-04-27 12:11:58 EDT <iflynaked> Service outages literally every day, sometimes multiple times a day. The outage lasts for like 2 hours. What‚Äôs the point of paying for a higher internet package if it‚Äôs not going to work when I‚Äôm actually home and using it?
1254803538007543809 2020-04-27 12:04:11 EDT <flwr6pwr9_> My internet is down, and has been for 2 hours now. Your system keeps telling me there‚Äôs not an outage in my area.   There obviously is some kind of issue.
1254802908207624192 2020-04-27 12:01:41 EDT <Xfinity> What is happening with your internet? Are you having outages, is your gateway disconnecting, etc.?
1254802152440107011 2020-04-27 11:58:40 EDT <Xfinity> What's going on with your internet? Did you check your My Account app to see if you're in an outage?
1254797927463243778 2020-04-27 11:41:53 EDT <bigteemarshall> Another @Xfinity outage. Becoming par for the course. My contract ends May 26th...it can‚Äôt get her fast enough #xfinityoutage #parforthecourse #willmybossunderstand #theywantallthismoney #withoutagesalmostdaily
1254795027756318721 2020-04-27 11:30:22 EDT <Xfinity> We know any down time is frustrating, are you in an outage currently?
1254782860721979395 2020-04-27 10:42:01 EDT <mattjeldridge> While I'm glad to hear from you, @comcastcares, I'm astounded to see this outage continue and have been saving screenshots. @comcast @xfinity tech support tells me the issue began April 18, 10 days ago. I'll DM you now.
1254781848355364874 2020-04-27 10:38:00 EDT <__misssindiaaa> - yeah xfinity can come get this shit . i don‚Äôt have the time . had them less than a month , and theres been 4 outages ??? at&t would never !!
1254780268444921859 2020-04-27 10:31:43 EDT <Xfinity> We want to correct this, are you seeing any area outage info showing in your My Account app?
1254776335236399105 2020-04-27 10:16:05 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked your My Account app to see if you're in an area outage?
1254771347458125824 2020-04-27 09:56:16 EDT <crsofr> Ha, yep..."No outages in your area right now."
1254770782481166338 2020-04-27 09:54:01 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Alex. Have you checked your My Account app to see if you're in an area outage?
1254696801522704384 2020-04-27 05:00:03 EDT <EngageFTW> #xfinityoutage #comcastoutage im sick and tired of being sick and tired xfinity thiscthe 100th outage this year and your site is stooopid  pic.twitter.com/WmlbbZsa3R
1254665306284281858 2020-04-27 02:54:54 EDT <GuthanKnight> Is there a say to check for an @Xfinity service outage without having to sign in? This is ridiculous.
1254654524809191424 2020-04-27 02:12:03 EDT <Beeyond_Kayy> Okay @Xfinity got me all the way fucked up with this outage! What is my quarantined ass supposed to watch?
1254641137551175680 2020-04-27 01:18:51 EDT <HiddenCalvin> Good lord üò≥üò≥ they don't even acknowledge issues!? Hell, Xfinity is stupid at times, but even they acknowledge outages ü§£
1254614333453004807 2020-04-26 23:32:21 EDT <maygunmayhem> @Xfinity you‚Äôre telling me I‚Äôm stuck at home due to a pandemic and you‚Äôre going to cut my internet off for FOUR HOURS for repairs? But when I check the outage map it says there is no outage.
1254612471018635264 2020-04-26 23:24:57 EDT <assassinate_84> Hate @Xfinity with a passion.. this is the 3rd time i have an outage in my area in the past couple of days.
1254518336941162498 2020-04-26 17:10:54 EDT <jtcarricato> @xfinity how do you actually talk to an live agent for a service outage?
1254505019182809089 2020-04-26 16:17:58 EDT <Aidan_Clemenson> Xfinity is on some weird shit rn. Last night they suddenly turned off our access to wifi (we still had tv), we called and they said there was outage in our area. This morning, my parents called again and were told that our package didn't include wifi, so my parents upgraded
1254454634451779588 2020-04-26 12:57:46 EDT <BJayZay> @Xfinity y‚Äôall play too much. I‚Äôve had 5 outages the past 4 days. Enough. Be better.
1254452322140372995 2020-04-26 12:48:34 EDT <RubabUddin> xfinity: can't have outages if they're not reported  pic.twitter.com/WBT5k0yD78
1254445398053158916 2020-04-26 12:21:04 EDT <VarunJuice> No production outages but outages reported on production.
1254443548805603332 2020-04-26 12:13:43 EDT <vnivargi> Lol. We were just talking about this. Real outage vs perceived outage üòÖ
1254421766560153600 2020-04-26 10:47:09 EDT <hvalentine20> Great. Another Xfinity outage during the apocalypse. Thanks a lot üòë
1254379649813135365 2020-04-26 07:59:48 EDT <Missg0diva> Another day another outage @xfinity
1254195748872257536 2020-04-25 19:49:03 EDT <DKM069> Apparently an xfinity outage.  Fortnite can take a break
1254082932135866368 2020-04-25 12:20:45 EDT <Tracy734G> Definitely not keep us connected. It is almost comical, at this point, how incompetent @xfinity is as an internet provider. Right now is their 3rd or 4th outage this week.
1254079373843607552 2020-04-25 12:06:37 EDT <brchapman65> @Xfinity conveniently is having a service outage in my area. Been out since 9:29 am. So I can‚Äôt watch @FoxNews ‚òπÔ∏è
1254079251227332609 2020-04-25 12:06:07 EDT <LiveLaughLov23> @Xfinity RUN ME MY MONEY. Y‚Äôall always have an outage.
1254075006423912449 2020-04-25 11:49:15 EDT <KamFranklin> Please join me in praying that @Xfinity fixes the outage in my area before the livestream tonight. They estimated 1pm CST, but lord...I know better. üòÅüò¢
1254065906646384640 2020-04-25 11:13:06 EDT <cmg799> @Xfinity internet outage Groveland MA
1254065607001112578 2020-04-25 11:11:54 EDT <jer_> And our nearly 2-week long ordeal has come to an end. We ultimately fixed our @xfinity internet outage by...switching providers.
1254060485584044034 2020-04-25 10:51:33 EDT <Its5iveWorld> Bitch ass @Xfinity wanna have an outage in Brandon, MS on my off day...now i can‚Äôt watch no damn tv
1254059703430193152 2020-04-25 10:48:27 EDT <jaffadan> @Xfinity @comcast this is our fourth outage in three days and it is not even noon.  pic.twitter.com/WaVvUeQcei
1254026665270939651 2020-04-25 08:37:10 EDT <cldem> @Xfinity 2 days in a row with service outages in the morning. Very frustrating when you‚Äôre staying at home! #internetoutagemeansnopeloton
1253926805188165634 2020-04-25 02:00:21 EDT <True_MWJ> @comcastcares @comcast @Xfinity and again another internet outage. Unstable connection for 4 weeks now with upload speed in the kbps range reminding me on dialup modem times. No waiving of contract fees though. What a scam. If anyone asks, I have records.
1253926429768605696 2020-04-25 01:58:52 EDT <True_MWJ> @comcastcares @Xfinity and again another internet outage. Unstable connection for 4 weeks now with upload speed in the kbps range reminding me on dialup modem times. No waiving of contract fees though. What a scam. If anyone asks, I have records.
1253925866473570305 2020-04-25 01:56:38 EDT <True_MWJ> @Xfinity and again another internet outage. Unstable connection for 4 weeks now with upload speed in the kbps range reminding me on dialup modem times. No waiving of contract fees though. What a scam. If anyone asks, I have records.
1253883593849331719 2020-04-24 23:08:39 EDT <GRoth03_> S/o to @Xfinity for the WiFi outage right now
1253881896997720069 2020-04-24 23:01:54 EDT <Seren1tynow> Xfinity is having outages I guess. No stream tonight :/
1253870995544215552 2020-04-24 22:18:35 EDT <dramslc> @Xfinity  once again important time middle of the NFL draft and there a darn outage in my area! Seriously get it together @comcast y‚Äôall getting worse than directv !
1253860645734400000 2020-04-24 21:37:28 EDT <BigDogggCeee> @Xfinity why do I pay so much for internet just for it to be shitty get it together or I‚Äôm going to @verizonfios  I‚Äôm tired of y‚Äôall having outages
1253858776341413889 2020-04-24 21:30:02 EDT <BoskyFN> Internet went down around 4:45 and @Xfinity says outage in my area and to have internet back by 8:50 which is absurd and now they are saying till 2:50 am lmao xfinity is the most dog shit internet company man like I can‚Äôt wait to leave this shit
1253849213152243712 2020-04-24 20:52:02 EDT <1SweetTink> Xfinity. Now you know all we got is our TVs. Come on with the outages!!! üò°üò°üò°
1253842545106288640 2020-04-24 20:25:32 EDT <minojmz> @Xfinity outage in 98042 ?
1253832844205535238 2020-04-24 19:46:59 EDT <shaylakristine> This XFinity outage though. üò≠üò©
1253800285400641537 2020-04-24 17:37:37 EDT <jer_> After more than a week of outages and intermittent issues, @Xfinity/@comcastcares has finally admitted there *might* be a problem in my area.
1253796136919289856 2020-04-24 17:21:08 EDT <myke113> No outage.  Apparently ALL of my devices are "paused" in xfi, blocking me from unpausing them.  WHY DOES THIS *KEEP* HAPPENING??
1253795475637129216 2020-04-24 17:18:30 EDT <Xfinity> Is the My Account app showing any outages in your area?
1253792807011131393 2020-04-24 17:07:54 EDT <theletterkaay> I‚Äôve been having various outages in my area & I work from home this is a tremendous inconvenience for me my zip code is 30331
1253789924957892609 2020-04-24 16:56:27 EDT <JosephWinfield> My internet is down I go online to check the map, no outages. I restart my modem, no dice. I see a Comcast worker pulling wires out so I check the app again. No outages. Still can‚Äôt use WiFi and @comcast @Xfinity try to tell me everything‚Äôs working fine but my modem is offline
1253784953747365891 2020-04-24 16:36:41 EDT <spoiledlildess> They had an outage! ü§¨
1253774713911984130 2020-04-24 15:56:00 EDT <Xfinity> We want to help out. Are you seeing any area outages or maintenance work showing in your My Account app?
1253762634165428230 2020-04-24 15:08:00 EDT <Xfinity> Does the Xfinity My Account app show the outage information?
1253760026868617221 2020-04-24 14:57:38 EDT <p1z4T> I told the homeowners so check your outage tix the coax was disconnected. On Kerby Pkwy in fort Washington md
1253755831801110529 2020-04-24 14:40:58 EDT <70sShawty> The internet has turned off four times since 8:30 this morning- on and off internet. These outages last from 2 minutes to 30 minutes then it turns back on. Restarting the modem doesn‚Äôt fix the situation.
1253751645483290629 2020-04-24 14:24:20 EDT <sincerelyqui> Ofcourse on my day off Xfinity want to mess up and have an outage in my area. I‚Äôm trying to play online and can‚Äôt Can‚Äôt even watch a movie on my tv. üò´üò´
1253751146637860868 2020-04-24 14:22:21 EDT <chrispaulsen> @Xfinity how do we report service outage?   I know the problem and keep getting stuck in bot loops
1253735965581066240 2020-04-24 13:22:02 EDT <HighxFemme> @Xfinity yet another day of outages with you guys and looking at this high ass cable bill. Are you guys going to cover my unemployment as well? Since I can‚Äôt seem to get any work done.
1253727266103857155 2020-04-24 12:47:28 EDT <ARCTIC_ST0RM> An Xfinity outage is the worst thing right now, no internet means my siblings can't do their schoolwork. Good job Xfinity for proving every day your service is utter shit
1253724785156055040 2020-04-24 12:37:36 EDT <ADaftGentleman> but that technicians are ONLY being dispatched right now in the case of a power outage. In short, @comcast, @xfinity, #internetessentials, y'all suck
1253716749138214915 2020-04-24 12:05:40 EDT <Xfinity> Are you in an area outage?
1253714920165609479 2020-04-24 11:58:24 EDT <AisforAustin> When Xfinity has an outage, thankful for cellular failover. I can continue WFH and EOQ and the kids continue with Netflix and distance learning. @meraki pic.twitter.com/bJXa9IAlcU
1253711053503885312 2020-04-24 11:43:02 EDT <Bethany_Qualls> So this is not the day anyone needed an internet service outage by Xfinity/ Comcast across San Francisco. Apparently it will be restored before 1 pm PST...ü§ûü§ûü§û
1253708887032725506 2020-04-24 11:34:26 EDT <spoiledlildess> It is time for me to find a new internet company. Xfinity is having an outage right now for the next 3 hours Smfh
1253706266586812421 2020-04-24 11:24:01 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Sam. If there is an ongoing outage in your area, then our techs are working to get everything restored asap. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hopefully it's not down for too much longer.
1253702056243867649 2020-04-24 11:07:17 EDT <Xfinity> Is there an outage reported in your area?
1253701299650154498 2020-04-24 11:04:17 EDT <Xfinity> Are you seeing any area related outages showing in your My Account app?
1253697043782152192 2020-04-24 10:47:22 EDT <TaylorrHits> there‚Äôs always an outage with xfinity
1253691391751880704 2020-04-24 10:24:54 EDT <Xfinity> We apologize for the issues you've been having. We know how important your connection is during these times. Are you still in an area outage?
1253689875892711424 2020-04-24 10:18:53 EDT <FootballFanRush> @xfinity @comcast had an area outage for over 24 hours which affected my sports business draft work and then have the nerve to be rude. Totally unacceptable
1253682846042148864 2020-04-24 09:50:57 EDT <dminmem> @comcast @xfinity #highspeedinternet has been erratic and/or offline for weeks. Website inquiries: "we've detected an outage‚Ä¶" the estimated time for restoration keeps moving. Bot (assistant) is illiterate. I want a refund for this week of unreliable service. #xfinitysucks
1253675012629938177 2020-04-24 09:19:49 EDT <Xfinity> Since the outage is still ongoing, the text stating it was resolved should not have been sent. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and be sure to monitor the app for any updates.
1253669566187630592 2020-04-24 08:58:11 EDT <dthompson2unl> @Xfinity, if it is routine maintenance, why don't you send out a message before it happens? And why is the outage map unavailable? Maintenance is welcome, though, as my 60Mbps plan is running and about 10M down and maybe 1M up. Switching to phone hotspot for critical moments.
1253669338705465345 2020-04-24 08:57:17 EDT <MiddleAgedAt26> What‚Äôs the point of an outage map, @Xfinity, if there is no estimated restoration time? I know my internet isn‚Äôt working. I don‚Äôt know when you are planning to fix it.

1253559898694180864 2020-04-24 01:42:24 EDT <FootballFanRush> So despite a current 24 hour  @Xfinity area outage we still got through the #NFLdraft thanks to @Verizon but not having service now that I work from home with a teen now on e-learning deserves a HUGE credit @comcast UNACCEPTABLE
1253558699173478401 2020-04-24 01:37:38 EDT <sanfordkobe3> @Xfinity is there a outage on WiFi I don‚Äôt see no tweet about it but the app is saying that it is
1253551156867010560 2020-04-24 01:07:40 EDT <kateegeorge> @Xfinity @comcastcares second outage this week. Your website is messed up too cuz this don‚Äôt make sense  pic.twitter.com/gD8Z9W8GZe

1253531184287662091 2020-04-23 23:48:18 EDT <The1Othh> @Xfinity need to get their shit together. At least 3 times a day an outage happens and it‚Äôs around the same time everyday. TF am I paying services for?
1253512291863138304 2020-04-23 22:33:14 EDT <_raveSimone> Xfinity always got an outageüòë
1253510956686159874 2020-04-23 22:27:55 EDT <lydkersey> and ofc xfinity is having an outage in my area rnüò§
1253510006617640962 2020-04-23 22:24:09 EDT <Heathernews> Thanks @Xfinity ... when my internet & TV goes out, you first tell me ‚Äúeverything looks good on our end.‚Äù Then, only after I troubleshoot for what seems like forever and report the outage, you send me this text?! Classy! ü§îüòí  pic.twitter.com/Mju23Xdxd5
1253491807234732032 2020-04-23 21:11:50 EDT <Xfinity> Did you check to see if there was a service outage in the area through the Xfinity My Account app?
1253488601842831362 2020-04-23 20:59:06 EDT <TheTabithaJ> I have had 5 days of on and off outages (including right now) affecting my job and my daughter‚Äôs e-schooling, and @Xfinity / @Comcast @comcastcares says that it only equals $22 of credit. Really!!!!!!! üôÑüò§ü§¨ü§¨
1253487337570435076 2020-04-23 20:54:04 EDT <tabby_j> I have had 5 days of on and off outages (including right now) affecting my work and my daughter‚Äôs e-schooling and @Xfinity @Comcast says that it only equals $22 of credit. Really!!!!!!! üôÑüò§ü§¨ü§¨
1253475763816288256 2020-04-23 20:08:05 EDT <uhhchavez> Dammit @xfinity. This outage might ruin Matlock for me. Delia could spoil it!!!
1253465508587794432 2020-04-23 19:27:20 EDT <HewalkstheSky> How many outages will xfinity have, gahdamn
1253465044538413056 2020-04-23 19:25:29 EDT <adamhilton> @Xfinity We‚Äôre now going on six and half hours of no internet. Can we get an update on outages or someone to help us troubleshoot?
1253435899750215680 2020-04-23 17:29:40 EDT <theJakeShaw> Yes. Says no outages, but I upgraded a couple months ago and I‚Äôm still getting poor speeds. Should be 200 but I‚Äôm running constantly at 80-90
1253433000563322881 2020-04-23 17:18:09 EDT <samsammisammi> Quarantine and Xfinity got an outage üò£
1253428861053710338 2020-04-23 17:01:42 EDT <ZhuIsRunning> @comcast internet is down around the metro Atlanta area for some users. Mine is actually down as well, according to the Xfinity outage website it will be down until around 1:30 AM after it previously stating it would be fixed by 1:45 PM today. Unable to work from home today
1253418233140412422 2020-04-23 16:19:28 EDT <bells_within> The service is going out every few hours. Two days ago it was out for 14 hours, yesterday was off intermittently, it just stopped again  supposedly until 9 pm: no internet, no TV and non existent customer service. Will you be charging outage time? @comcast @Xfinity
1253414957615476737 2020-04-23 16:06:27 EDT <FootballFanRush> So of all the days for @xfinity @comcast to have an area outage it would be the day I need tv & internet for the #NFLDraft and staff..... unexceptionable. It‚Äôs been out for over 6 hours
1253414356395520001 2020-04-23 16:04:04 EDT <jaelinofficial> @comcast @Xfinity Do yall know when yall internet will be back up? Im using the Xfinity Hotspot and paid $19.95 to use for a week. Just for the connection to experience an outage.
1253402995661963271 2020-04-23 15:18:55 EDT <dSchmel> yes from both computers and I followed the steps for my iphone and ipad. This started 2 days ago after there was an outage the night before in my area.
1253402807606149121 2020-04-23 15:18:11 EDT <sheenamonrolls> @Xfinity outage again! ugh #switchingtofios
1253399006979543040 2020-04-23 15:03:04 EDT <Xfinity> If there's an outage reported on your My Account app, keep an eye on the app for updates.
1253398073491021824 2020-04-23 14:59:22 EDT <Xfinity> Let's see what's going on. Are you seeing any area outages showing in your My Account app?
1253395172102221826 2020-04-23 14:47:50 EDT <Xfinity> We don't throttle, but we can take a look into your service issues. Does your My Account app indicate that you're in an outage?
1253391357390884864 2020-04-23 14:32:41 EDT <OjRejuiced> im so sick of xfinityüò£ i pay $160 a month to have outages everyday like dam
1253386179032088578 2020-04-23 14:12:06 EDT <apgibson42> I've been super lucky not to have had any real outages during Corona (also with @Xfinity). Counting my blessings. It's also a minor marvel that I haven't heard of any widespread, mass outages. Maybe we're overdue!
1253383193140609025 2020-04-23 14:00:14 EDT <Xfinity> We want to help. Are you seeing any area outage info showing in your My Account app?
1253380911921586177 2020-04-23 13:51:10 EDT <BlackMagics66> Xfinity-Comcast internet having serious issues in Illinois. Xfinity internet is fast becoming unreliable, outages everyday.
1253365684827910144 2020-04-23 12:50:40 EDT <MsB_Queenin> Xfinity cost entirely too much to be experiencing outages. I‚Äôm so sick of them
1253356923199590400 2020-04-23 12:15:51 EDT <TeeJEngelking> Nope. Unless y‚Äôall just have outages 2-5 times a day at random times. Doesn‚Äôt matter if I‚Äôm just chilling on my phone or in the middle of an online game. It always wants to cut off and reset for like 5 minutes at a time.
1253346579022589952 2020-04-23 11:34:45 EDT <Justin__Charles> Major xfinity outages nation wide #internetoutage
1253341222627835904 2020-04-23 11:13:28 EDT <Xfinity> We know this downtime is frustrating, especially during these times. We're working to fix this ASAP. Are you seeing a time of completion for this outage in your My Account app?
1253340998123401225 2020-04-23 11:12:34 EDT <a_mcnugget> This Xfinity outage means I get to lay in bed and relax for a while üëåüèæ
1253337684371632128 2020-04-23 10:59:24 EDT <oneplusmoe> @Xfinity 3rd outage within two weeks! I work from home and each day this has effected me tremendously with work! Trying to reach a rep is impossible! I‚Äôve been trying the chat for over an hour! NO LUCK!!! Horrible service all of sudden‚Äîtime & money wasted
1253333682267414528 2020-04-23 10:43:30 EDT <fkracidfire> The gateway drops internet multiple times a day. Its frustrating because my wife is working from home. There was an outage today and someone working on the line but its been happening for months.
1253333663485321222 2020-04-23 10:43:25 EDT <TheHope4Music> I have important docs that‚Äôs time sensitive and @xfinity decides to have an outage in my area üòí
1253330582320279562 2020-04-23 10:31:11 EDT <Sabby70940485> Well geez. Given the fact we have an outage in my area at the moment. 1000 or so people trying to work from home and kids trying to connect to school. And we can‚Äôt.
1253324845590315013 2020-04-23 10:08:23 EDT <Xfinity> Did you check your My Account app to see if there's an outage in your area?
1253324360095535104 2020-04-23 10:06:27 EDT <TheCNikola> At first the modem wasn‚Äôt working so I checked the app and showed there was an outage of 51-500. Because this has happened to me before I unplugged modem for 15 seconds plugged back in and now working fine. The app shows all is well. Why does the internet randomly just shut down?
1253323247870857216 2020-04-23 10:02:02 EDT <CChristineFair> @Xfinity sent us a new router because of our ongoing internet outages. It has no power supply. They sent us a plastic, made in China, lump of crap.  At least I got through my class last night.
1253320359471800321 2020-04-23 09:50:33 EDT <DeVona_Marie> @xfinity is there a reason I don‚Äôt have internet service and there are no outages showing for my address. WTH
1253313981730734080 2020-04-23 09:25:13 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Spencer. Does your My Account app indicate that there's an outage in your area?
1253313864017510400 2020-04-23 09:24:45 EDT <Xfinity> The app should update with an estimated time of resolution. If the Internet section of the app updates that the outage has been cleared but you're still noticing issues with the service, then I would suggest sending a DM at that time.
1253311496542658560 2020-04-23 09:15:20 EDT <Xfinity> We want to correct this. Are you in an outage, or experiencing issues currently?
1253311297522892802 2020-04-23 09:14:33 EDT <Xfinity> We know this is frustrating, are you still going through an outage?
1253309387537551366 2020-04-23 09:06:58 EDT <Xfinity> It looks like the app is showing a service outage detected under the Internet section. For more info, send a DM with the account info here:  https://xfin.tv/support¬† and our support team will take a look.
1253260147075493888 2020-04-23 05:51:18 EDT <DarthBirdy3> Xfinity outage part 2. Way to ruin my special occasion
1253228626327281667 2020-04-23 03:46:03 EDT <DarthBirdy3> We have an xfinity service outage. Hang tight and we should be back online soon
1253205477409853441 2020-04-23 02:14:03 EDT <PeachWntsRvenge> Sooo Florida people, is there a Comcast or Xfinity outage! Sound off. Bradenton area. #comcast #xfinity
1253193036647018496 2020-04-23 01:24:37 EDT <fosnotlim> @Xfinity HELLO pls tell me who decided it was cool to have there be an internet outage that will last 6 hours for maintenance DURING A PANDEMIC THAT HAS EVERYONE AT HOME ALREADY?????? because i need u to tell them to drop their pin i just wanna talk
1253180184196415489 2020-04-23 00:33:33 EDT <AyannaSpeller> So xfinity decides to perform a random outage without informing me.. I cant do my school work or see accurately on my security cameras.. That's the worst @Xfinity smh.
1253180110204735493 2020-04-23 00:33:15 EDT <TeeJEngelking> @Xfinity Bruh, why is your internet service so trash? Had it 3 months and have more outages in a day than I‚Äôve ever had in 3 years with @verizonfios
1253179203928932354 2020-04-23 00:29:39 EDT <MissKenya35> Is there outages in Ellenwood, GA @comcastcares @comcast @Xfinity
1253177194030891008 2020-04-23 00:21:40 EDT <mattjeldridge> Dear @Xfinity, so great to have your Internet service during this #covid19 #pandemic. Except today. When you promised to resolve an overnight outage first by 11:18am, then 3:09pm, then 7:15pm and now...10:50pm.  pic.twitter.com/JCopo60wjX
1253161649806008320 2020-04-22 23:19:54 EDT <tarunvignesh> üòÇXfinity confirmed an outage in your area that we're working to resolve by 06:55 PM. We'll text you when it's fixed. Details:  http://xfinity.com/status¬† TxtHelpOrStop
1253148358610497536 2020-04-22 22:27:05 EDT <ben_foss27> @discord I am down 100% across all my devices on Xfinity - is there an outage ?
1253141006754607105 2020-04-22 21:57:52 EDT <Kath835> I wanted apologize to Comcast Xfinity they did not caused the outage but iit was a construction dig in.There team let know the cause. Thank you #comcast #XFINITY  https://twitter.com/Kath835/status/1253026956276232193¬†‚Ä¶
1253128909215772676 2020-04-22 21:09:48 EDT <Kath835> @Xfinity please accept my apologies . The Comcast outage in our area was caused by a construction dig in Thank you getting back to me. #comcast #xfinity
1253127251220213760 2020-04-22 21:03:13 EDT <betrayy_> You have outages all over Chicagoland mate... They're happening frequently nowadays and it's unbearable
1253082299458916352 2020-04-22 18:04:35 EDT <d_aghassi> Nothing like an @Xfinity outage in the middle of the day while I work remote. Solid...
1253070911751753730 2020-04-22 17:19:20 EDT <Xfinity> Check the Xfinity My Account app to see if there's an outage in the area.
1253063048941748225 2020-04-22 16:48:06 EDT <TheRealTruC> @Xfinity you guys are going through your 2nd outage in one days telling me I have to wait 4 hours. Is this really what I‚Äôm paying for?
1253059541060681733 2020-04-22 16:34:09 EDT <TennKayDoh> Multiple service outages with internet and television.  Outages at 2 pm, 3pm, and 4 pm on 4/20/20.  Outages at 2 pm and 3 pm today.  Spent two hours on with support to resolve another recent outage.  So much effort required of me for a service for which I pay.
1253058812367515654 2020-04-22 16:31:16 EDT <dana416> My sup just asked me to call Xfinity to see what‚Äôs wrong. Mind you I sent screenshots from the app that shows the outage and it‚Äôs affecting 2,000 people in the area. It literally says they are working to resolve it!!  pic.twitter.com/mkhZ9LakV0
1253058573271289860 2020-04-22 16:30:19 EDT <jomtnx> But there‚Äôs been at least 2 outages maybe 3 a week... üôÇ
1253055754250129408 2020-04-22 16:19:07 EDT <Xfinity> We know outages are frustrating, especially during these times. We're working to fix this ASAP. Keep an eye on your My Account app for completion updates.
1253054997186711557 2020-04-22 16:16:06 EDT <dana416> I swear Xfinity has an outage in Oak Park every damn day. I know my job prolly think I be bullshitting everytime my shit logs out but wtf I‚Äôm supposed to do about it  pic.twitter.com/SJAAbeOY74
1253054745981399041 2020-04-22 16:15:06 EDT <drallamnadroj> we have an outage, pretty much the only one in Arkansas, but can‚Äôt find any updates on when/if it will be resolved
1253054714855424000 2020-04-22 16:14:59 EDT <jomtnx> Why is there always a goddamn outage üò° @Xfinity
1253050928372088833 2020-04-22 15:59:56 EDT <robotkegger> @Xfinity why do you not automatically reduce bulls when there is a known outage? Why do you make customers call your horrendous call center and deal with more crap, instead of just adjusting the bill accordingly?
1253041977467252747 2020-04-22 15:24:22 EDT <Xfinity> Have you reset it? Also recommend checking your My Account app to see if there's an outage reported in your area.
1253040310273421314 2020-04-22 15:17:44 EDT <beladane146> I disagree with this claim. Day two of serous internet issues. Can‚Äôt get anyone on the phone and the app just says there isn‚Äôt an outage in my area. Would love some help.
1253038882842710017 2020-04-22 15:12:04 EDT <KevinZiegmann> The major outage that people nation wide are experiencing. I pay the $20 a week for the xfinitywifi hotspot on my laptop and I am only able to access YouTube and other sites owned by Google. Other than that, just about everything else is unable to be connected to.
1253030860649115650 2020-04-22 14:40:12 EDT <Xfinity> We're working to fix this issue ASAP, we know downtime during this time is frustrating. Keep an eye on your My Account app for updates. You can send us a DM here:  https://xfin.tv/support¬† , in regard to your bill due to the outage.
1253029270487814147 2020-04-22 14:33:52 EDT <2and2equals5> @Xfinity THERE IS AN OUTAGE. FIX IT FIX IT FIX IT ALSO GIVE ME A CREDIT FOR NOT INTERNETS!
1253027755555352576 2020-04-22 14:27:51 EDT <xMOFOJones> The xfinity mobile app tells you when there is planned maintenance and outages
1253026080044150786 2020-04-22 14:21:12 EDT <snowblink_c> No internet since last night, outage expected resolve time increase every 4 hours. No way to work...this is ridiculous
1253025431776710656 2020-04-22 14:18:37 EDT <Kath835> @Xfinity I have experienced another service disruption for the second time this week. It is impairing my ability to get some high priority work done.   In addition my neighbor was told there is a planned outage scheduled for our area tomorrow.  #upset #disgusted #xfinity
1253011401272184841 2020-04-22 13:22:52 EDT <Xfinity> We can help if you're having issues. Are you in an outage currently?
1253009407098728449 2020-04-22 13:14:57 EDT <bennetyee> quite ironic/funny--networking issues, restarted cable modem, longer than usual reboot. @Xfinity claims there's no outage, but  https://www.xfinity.com/support/status-map¬†‚Ä¶ outage map is having an outage, so not giving any info for my area. w/ outage info outage, how do we know there was no outage? :)
1253008253933535234 2020-04-22 13:10:22 EDT <ogvek> i'd hardly call consistent outages & sub-1 mbps speed tests "connected"  fix your shit to keep up with everyone staying home, christ
1253003398233886723 2020-04-22 12:51:04 EDT <ayeschepp> Our biweekly internet outage is occurring. Thanks @Xfinity! @comcastcares
1252996129278627844 2020-04-22 12:22:11 EDT <Godisyn> @Xfinity y‚Äôall need to get you‚Äôre shit together tired of these power outages

1252991801029468165 2020-04-22 12:04:59 EDT <TaylorrHits> It‚Äôs not xfinity if they don‚Äôt have an outage every single fucking morning
1252990409279778819 2020-04-22 11:59:27 EDT <Cnsrvative> @Xfinity Could you please provide s little more clarity... 3 outages in 24 hours. Your app says all good, except it also says it's not...  pic.twitter.com/2r1nGDv7pD
1252987817883570179 2020-04-22 11:49:09 EDT <cabronaperocute> @Xfinity what‚Äôs with all these outages üò´üò´
1252984786542526464 2020-04-22 11:37:07 EDT <mychempunk> Wow. Another @comcast @Xfinity outage in my neighborhood. I'm so glad my parents are paying a lot of money for our system to be out all the time.üëèüëèüëèüëè  pic.twitter.com/qDP7IA1pjl
1252983640272879617 2020-04-22 11:32:33 EDT <Xfinity> We know any downtime can be frustrating, especially during these times. Are you seeing a time of completion for this outage in your My Account app?
1252981510241685510 2020-04-22 11:24:05 EDT <abcdefGINA16> Going on 2+ hours with out WiFi @Xfinity ‚Äî seems like every day I have 1hr+ outage. #WFH is becoming impossible
1252973777232769025 2020-04-22 10:53:22 EDT <Xfinity> How long has this been going on? Are you seeing any area outages or maintenance work showing in your My Account app?
1252970813491421185 2020-04-22 10:41:35 EDT <DLJM1977> Yes 90% of the time there is a service outage in the area...and 10% of the time there is no outage. The sevice just goes out & then the modem restarts
1252965125440618496 2020-04-22 10:18:59 EDT <NicholasFelts> @Xfinity @comcast I have had two outages this week. What's the point of paying for internet when I cant use it?
1252964924415897603 2020-04-22 10:18:11 EDT <soycafesero> Yet another @xfinity outage @comcast
1252963386696110080 2020-04-22 10:12:04 EDT <jakethebrahh> @Xfinity yeah outage again today in Boulder, CO after being down briefly yesterday too  https://twitter.com/DetectorDigi/status/1252619179213025287¬†‚Ä¶
1252961980366848000 2020-04-22 10:06:29 EDT <Xfinity> Hi! Does your My Account app indicate that there's an outage reported?
1252957453572022274 2020-04-22 09:48:30 EDT <BHLevesque> @Xfinity internet dropped in Mansfield MA. Aware of service outage?

1252927082956500992 2020-04-22 07:47:49 EDT <Yellowman617> I called last night and hall told me this "outage" was gonna last till 2am...well it's 7am @comcastcares @Xfinity
1252926743800942593 2020-04-22 07:46:28 EDT <Fincey47> There are always outages in progress.  Any day of any year, these maps show outages.   I'm using xfinity in Chicagoland which routes into downtown and I'm online.
1252897785466191874 2020-04-22 05:51:24 EDT <ShenequeProctor> .@Xfinity /.@comcast / .@comcastcares - Aren't you going to comment on what appears to be the massive outage affecting Mattapan, Hyde Park, Dorchester, JP, and parts of Roslindale since about 22:30 last night (4/21/20)?  #Comcastoutage
1252852020760862721 2020-04-22 02:49:33 EDT <mikemcintosh> That 5 minute Xfinity internet outage at midnight was too long.
1252851358119518213 2020-04-22 02:46:55 EDT <bnunn9> @Xfinity @comcast  what‚Äôs going on with these outages? Can‚Äôt handle all of America on the internet? Disappointed customer
1252849922086367237 2020-04-22 02:41:12 EDT <i_kiwifruit> @Xfinity @comcast @comcastcares i don‚Äôt have access to our account i just want to know if i‚Äôm in an actual internet outage why isn‚Äôt that sort of map available without a login
1252848629066330112 2020-04-22 02:36:04 EDT <thanameHOT> Here go xfinity with this outage in the area
1252834584875528192 2020-04-22 01:40:16 EDT <abaird2020> Thanks to a big fat @comcast outage I missed it. All I have to say is my Internet best be up and running when I start work in a few hours bc if I miss anymore of THAT my a$$ is coming up out of quarantine to tell them about it. @Xfinity @comcastcares #fixit
1252834035602055168 2020-04-22 01:38:05 EDT <SmiffTaylor_> I know this @Xfinity outage needs to be fixed by the time I‚Äôm up for work. Goodness.  pic.twitter.com/CDJPa1R5Eu
1252802246716411905 2020-04-21 23:31:46 EDT <JCP_7> ITS BEEN AN OUTAGE THE PAST 2 DAYS @Xfinity MY BILL BETTER BE $20 OR SOMETHING
1252794359709339648 2020-04-21 23:00:25 EDT <kshante> Look. I know this is a first world problem. I know. But honestly, @Xfinity get it together. A service outage that isn‚Äôt resolved in the time that you quoted...in a pandemic. Come on.
1252783427322970114 2020-04-21 22:16:59 EDT <LewiHype> @Xfinity What's up with your service ??? All of a sudden an outage
1252783051660288004 2020-04-21 22:15:29 EDT <walshcaitlin> It's not looking good. 2AM. @Xfinity @comcastcares app already registered the outage so it's kinda out of my hands.
1252782195967737857 2020-04-21 22:12:05 EDT <walshcaitlin> And got an Xfinity outage notice. Probably related?
1252781120304881664 2020-04-21 22:07:49 EDT <JMHardinBoston> Joy! we have an outage with Xfinity so I have no tv or internet/wifi. It should be fixed by 2 am. So much for getting on Second Life tonight. üò°
1252781067402194946 2020-04-21 22:07:36 EDT <James4Boston> @Xfinity so not happy with you right now ... outage in middle of #princetribute ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I need a one day‚Äôs prorated refund ...
1252778118017880064 2020-04-21 21:55:53 EDT <TheCoolestEbony> I'm this ü§èüèæ close to calling out of virtual work tmr.   @Xfinity is playing with my neighborhood, yet again.   3rd outage today.  I'm too tired for this.
1252775950317768704 2020-04-21 21:47:16 EDT <tortugasbastian> @Xfinity Pleaaaase stop the Outages in Chicago 60657 (minimally 5 per day)  pic.twitter.com/h5M4aFx91q
1252763917174091778 2020-04-21 20:59:27 EDT <EliSeeney> My WiFi was down üòÇ part of that big ass Xfinity outage
1252746576713281536 2020-04-21 19:50:33 EDT <K0PA53T1K> Yep did all that no outages reported and states last one was fixed but your OWN speed test shows an Error on upload speeds. If you think I havent already done these things you are mistaken. Your service today has had issues across the COUNTRY. #comcastcares
1252745213338140672 2020-04-21 19:45:08 EDT <Xfinity> Download the Xfinity My Account app to stay up to date with any outage information, give your modem a restart and troubleshoot your connection.
1252743508516982785 2020-04-21 19:38:21 EDT <K0PA53T1K> @Xfinity Whats up with your internet in the 80111 area. We were told an outage then that it was fixed. I would call 3 mbps download and 0.04 upload NOT fixed. We have been told its our modem. It is NOT our modem. What is going on ?????
1252741776517083139 2020-04-21 19:31:28 EDT <SamInteractive> Clearly.   Hey @Xfinity @comcast @comcastcares are service outages just going to be a daily occurrence now?
1252739929068703750 2020-04-21 19:24:08 EDT <Irfan_afzaal> Checked. It says there is no outage in my area :/
1252731304078184448 2020-04-21 18:49:52 EDT <joshdeadlifts> My internet has been crazy slow with my ps4. Is this part of the outage issues @comcast / @Xfinity has been having?
1252729541040181259 2020-04-21 18:42:51 EDT <TimHay8> @Xfinity Hope I get some credit for this outage
1252713079655116800 2020-04-21 17:37:27 EDT <hailey_such> I did. For 4 hours it said my modem was the issue, so I worked on it for 2 hours. Then finally called and the robot said it was an outage.
1252708324606427136 2020-04-21 17:18:33 EDT <PatriotMaple> Xfinity and comcast outage? You dont say... maybe its because they suck.
1252707084132589577 2020-04-21 17:13:37 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Hailey. I wanted to make sure you've checked through the Xfinity My Account app to see if there was any outage information.
1252698538582192134 2020-04-21 16:39:40 EDT <RioShad_> 3 hours later and Xfinity still out I ain't never had a outage last this long
1252697823042310144 2020-04-21 16:36:49 EDT <toshapent> @Xfinity these daily outages for my node are ridiculous and right in the middle of the workday.  And getting a business account isnt even an option cause its ON THE SAME NODE!! Will you still expect me to pay my bill when I get fired because you cant provide reliable services?
1252689016216059909 2020-04-21 16:01:49 EDT <here4decomments> @comcastcares I‚Äôm in Denver and have had an intermittent but persistent @Xfinity internet outage the last 2+ days which is severely impacting my ability to work and kids to attend school. Need resolution ASAP.
1252688845050712065 2020-04-21 16:01:09 EDT <JustinWhite999> It keeps saying there are outages in the area.  The internet works for my phone again for a few minutes but can not connect on any other devices.  This has been happening for about 4-5 days now.  I have reset my router a few times as well, to no avail
1252687370480226306 2020-04-21 15:55:17 EDT <AEsenler> @comcastcares and @Xfinity recommendation: be proactive with your customer communication and send a text or message when there is a widespread outage in an area or customer zip code. Shouldn't be difficult to implement and keeps people informed
1252684295900037120 2020-04-21 15:43:04 EDT <EdanRubin> @eerosupport having constant outages and it‚Äôs not my modem or Xfinity service. Have tried calling your support line unsuccessfully. Need support.
1252681237627453440 2020-04-21 15:30:55 EDT <fantom_pk> @Xfinity your internet is ASS . I‚Äôve had 5 outages in the last week ??
1252670751435603975 2020-04-21 14:49:15 EDT <Tracy734G> @Xfinity I experience multiple days every week. Literally right now I am unable to work due to an outage. Your tweet is ridiculous.  https://twitter.com/Xfinity/status/1250892742206595080¬†‚Ä¶
1252669301812854784 2020-04-21 14:43:29 EDT <CortTheBeauty> In other news this XFINITY outage is helping me get yet another day off from work. The lord knew what I needed! Won‚Äôt he do it. üôåüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩ
1252666354542444544 2020-04-21 14:31:46 EDT <thelatashajames> Yes. There‚Äôs an outage. The ETA was 12:30 pm EST ans it‚Äôs now 2:31pm EST.
1252658302900752384 2020-04-21 13:59:47 EDT <AndrewTHolmes> Fourth consecutive day in which we experience an Internet outage. What in the hell is going on with @Xfinity in Memphis? @comcast
1252653709412175872 2020-04-21 13:41:32 EDT <Bedstuyflyty> WFH but Xfinity has an outage in my area so I‚Äôm looking like an idiot with my colleagues ü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  https://twitter.com/_OnlyBDrakeford/status/1252594441858232328¬†‚Ä¶

1252652520876519424 2020-04-21 13:36:48 EDT <YELLING_KIRBY> @Xfinity @comcast ARE TRASH.   SERVICE OUTAGE, AND I CANT EVEN GET IN CONTACT WITH AN AGENT. THEY JUST TELL ME TO RESET MY MODEM AND TIGHTEN MY CABLES.   IVE DONE THAT 3 TIMES, IDIOTS. CONNECT ME WITH SOMEONE.
1252648082908475392 2020-04-21 13:19:10 EDT <theRealJohnLacy> No it does not show an outage.  It‚Äôs back up now, but has gone off and on several times today where it says ‚Äúno internet access‚Äù
1252645639391006720 2020-04-21 13:09:28 EDT <Xfinity> We want to help. Are you seeing any area outage information in your My Account app?

1252632196701196289 2020-04-21 12:16:03 EDT <p_luhar> Hey @Xfinity - when there‚Äôs an outage we should get some money back. Maybe then they‚Äôll stop.   #Comcastoutage #Comcastdown #xfinity
1252628579168518145 2020-04-21 12:01:40 EDT <iancraig515> I am! Says it will be resolved by 12:11 pm EST, are you booking action on it? Max bet over ....Atlanta area outage fwiw
1252628004292960256 2020-04-21 11:59:23 EDT <Xfinity> Are you in an area outage?
1252625597362130944 2020-04-21 11:49:49 EDT <SherylEppler> I found my Internet was offline Sunday morning at 8am. The My Account app said the issue was my modem, to schedule a tech visit. At noon Sunday, the My Account app was updated to say ‚ÄúThere is an outage, we‚Äôre working as fast as we can and will text you when service is restored.‚Äù
1252623036668416002 2020-04-21 11:39:39 EDT <TheCoolestEbony> Second xFinity outage this week. It's Tuesday.   Honestly, let me just go to sleep until Friday. Not in the mood. Trying to make things happen over here! üò§ They getting in the way.   (Don't tell me to use my phone's hotspot. Teddy Riley and I are on the same 1G plan.)
1252618963827200000 2020-04-21 11:23:28 EDT <Xfinity> Are you still in an area outage?
1252612878772973568 2020-04-21 10:59:17 EDT <jasminetyon> We've had an Xfinity outage for nearly a week now. How tf am I supposed to work from home?
1252611791085076480 2020-04-21 10:54:58 EDT <Xfinity> We can help. Are you seeing any area outages going on in your My Account app?
1252611472611516418 2020-04-21 10:53:42 EDT <JasonT> This internet outage may be the thing that finally gets us to ditch Comcast Xfinity now that we‚Äôre out of Cambridge and have other options. Any locals want to recommend RCN vs Verizon Fios?
1252607548164800512 2020-04-21 10:38:06 EDT <CortTheBeauty> Meanwhile XFINITY has an outage until 1pm in my area so I lucked up into a little half day off. About to take a nap cause I got 4 hours of sleep last night.
1252606919673593856 2020-04-21 10:35:36 EDT <Xfinity> Are you seeing any area outages in your My Account app?
1252604585480458243 2020-04-21 10:26:20 EDT <Xfinity> We know any down time is frustrating, especially during times like this. We can take a look to see if there's something happening other than the outages causing the connection issues. Send us a DM here:  https://xfin.tv/support¬† , for help.

1252603451193921538 2020-04-21 10:21:49 EDT <MonsterRain> @Xfinity any reported outages in northern Jacksonville, FL? I‚Äôm hearing degraded service from our healthcare users on that end of town.
1252601773304446976 2020-04-21 10:15:09 EDT <Xfinity> What's going on with your internet? Are you still in an outage?
1252597770424369153 2020-04-21 09:59:15 EDT <WithoutLobe> @Xfinity my internet is out and I can‚Äôt even access the website to check outages or issues as it is stating I don‚Äôt have permission to use the site when accessing it using my 5G on my phone. Are there issues in Chicago??
1252584312223993858 2020-04-21 09:05:46 EDT <Xfinity> Hi, are you still in an outage currently?
1252517222234206212 2020-04-21 04:39:11 EDT <vincentvllrz> @Xfinity why the fuck is there an outage in my area every fucking week holy shittttttt
1252504534544527360 2020-04-21 03:48:46 EDT <THEKristinMoura> @comcast @Xfinity any outages in Massachusetts today? Particularly west medford area.  Nets dropped me twice this evening.  2nd time, hasnt come back yet and its been 25 mins.  I dont see anyone else discussing outages. So don't know.
1252480436976189440 2020-04-21 02:13:00 EDT <AveryKillaavery> Why do you keep having outages
1252476401195892737 2020-04-21 01:56:58 EDT <LagodaBrian> Another day, another motherfucking @Xfinity outage. If this is really planned maintenance, why can't you warn me about it in advance? Why can't I get a text saying "today, we're going to charge you for four hours of internet service that we have no intention to provide. Again."
1252453719079366656 2020-04-21 00:26:50 EDT <UAwoody> @Xfinity @comcastcares to you this isn‚Äôt an outage or a degradation. We pay for 150mbps connection and it‚Äôs 10:20pm MST. All day up and down this night is no different, COVID or not. Your gateway, your Pods, your service. #YesIRestarted #Again #NoDayTimeRush #TiredOfSlowdown pic.twitter.com/br1R28fRPP

1252435340725346305 2020-04-20 23:13:49 EDT <Yoboykylee> @Xfinity @comcastcares @comcast internet been down for the last few hours  but thier no outage in my area .
1252360820446474247 2020-04-20 18:17:41 EDT <mc4three> My Acct and XiFi Apps both indicate no outages or any service issue
1252332211120025602 2020-04-20 16:24:00 EDT <DMalauni> I‚Äôd try to but we dont have WiFi because of the outages you guys keep ignoring and won‚Äôt fix
1252327553513197571 2020-04-20 16:05:30 EDT <DanShenise> Of course @Xfinity fucked up the signal at the end of the show I was watching. I was waiting for the end because it‚Äôs so good, then it starts intermittently pausing, then stops recording. Fuck you. Not a week goes by without an hours long outage or 5 hiccups like this.
1252323427333091330 2020-04-20 15:49:06 EDT <e_subject> @Xfinity you texted me and told me my outage will be resolved at 10:11 then later text me it will be done at 3:11.  My friend that live 5 house down from me had the outage to and had his internet working at 3:11. This     ridiculous. Please fix it  , I have something due at 6.
1252316844918296577 2020-04-20 15:22:57 EDT <Xfinity> We know down time can be frustrating. We can help with your bill due to these outages. Send us a DM here:  https://xfin.tv/support¬† , for assistance.
1252312415678746629 2020-04-20 15:05:21 EDT <math_y0o> @Xfinity day two of internittent service outages for me. Will i be receiving a refund for this?
1252311881152450561 2020-04-20 15:03:13 EDT <Jarhard> Really getting tired of these network outages during the day from @Xfinity. Hasn‚Äôt been very reliable the last couple weeks.
1252307645471625216 2020-04-20 14:46:24 EDT <ericabeknowing> Wow so there‚Äôs an Xfinity Internet outage right now. I could cry.
1252298643324964865 2020-04-20 14:10:37 EDT <joyedelia> Wanted to watch a movie while Mia did her class work but of course there‚Äôs an outage üòê @Xfinity
1252298344283746304 2020-04-20 14:09:26 EDT <Surragard> I have Xfinity as well. I would say not more than 1-2 times a year I have a service outage and it‚Äôs usually less than half a day. The last two times involved someone driving into a pole so that‚Äôs not really Xfinity‚Äôs fault. I‚Äôm happy with the service but it is pricey.
1252293414676312065 2020-04-20 13:49:51 EDT <grade5inmi> Same. Says no outages in our area. Haven‚Äôt had cable or internet since last night. The 3 days before that it would go on for an hour and off for an hour. üòë
1252292829138870274 2020-04-20 13:47:31 EDT <paix120> From someone who works there "There‚Äôs a maintenance tech working on the outage now. Your neighborhood is out. The entire node isn‚Äôt down. He says it looks like it would normally take about an hour (fingers crossed)."
1252291016431996928 2020-04-20 13:40:19 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked your My Account app to see if there's an outage reported in your area?
1252288826459865090 2020-04-20 13:31:37 EDT <Tink3O3> Hey @Xfinity tv outages, internet outages not a damn thing working. Yall pushin to get that 5G up arnt ya?
1252285765654122497 2020-04-20 13:19:27 EDT <paix120> Thanks for confirming. A friend nearby had an outage yesterday. Ugh ‚òπÔ∏è

1252229575846830080 2020-04-20 09:36:10 EDT <DinkyShop> Hey @comcastcares when is internet service going to be restored in Chicago?   Says there‚Äôs an outage and it‚Äôs already been out 4 hours..  @Xfinity
1252228210789625856 2020-04-20 09:30:45 EDT <BazookaJo3y> @Xfinity I‚Äôm getting 930down and 14up right now.  Trying to get my stream on tonight around 1030pm will this issue be resolved by then?  I can not seem to see if there is outages in my area.
1252223994113163264 2020-04-20 09:14:00 EDT <Cristin04968720> @Xfinity how long is this outage expected to last for
1252222997794099200 2020-04-20 09:10:02 EDT <Hotboydre2x> Internet outage in my area and I have to clock in to work in 1 hour. Thanks @Xfinity
1252216979567624197 2020-04-20 08:46:07 EDT <ThePharaoh20> Wow what a convenient time for @xfinity to have an outage when I have a scheduled work call. Thanks guise....
1252215441092681731 2020-04-20 08:40:00 EDT <MommaKarma> Another Xfinity service outage. I‚Äôm tired of this shit!
1252105288372629504 2020-04-20 01:22:18 EDT <GlamazonJay> XFINITY really having a fucking outage right now. Wow. My show was just about to get good.
1252099572932935682 2020-04-20 00:59:35 EDT <official_leek7> Come on xfinity tighten up bruh I pay to much every month for an outage ü§¨ @Xfinity

1252071848084246530 2020-04-19 23:09:25 EDT <Lalexdam> Another day another @Xfinity outage :)))))))))))) good thing I‚Äôm paying $100 a month for service that cuts out almost every day!!!
1252051123923496960 2020-04-19 21:47:04 EDT <rachelsehgal> @comcastcares really. all the surrounding neighborhoods have outages but we just need to tighten all the cables on our devices?  pic.twitter.com/y7z6uDz2Y8
1252050639011676162 2020-04-19 21:45:08 EDT <DrBravo2> For the 3rd time in a month, our @Xfinity service has stopped working out of nowhere and they refuse to acknowledge there is an outage. I'm convinced this is to avoid giving us a credit.
1252040189226086400 2020-04-19 21:03:37 EDT <Raaandy_tv> Friggin internet outage. It is an outrage @Xfinity

1252006315104370689 2020-04-19 18:49:01 EDT <freddiebmusic90> As it turns out, my outage actually isn‚Äôt @Xfinity‚Äòs fault. Birds chewed on the wires in the attic space of my apartment building, won‚Äôt have service for a few days ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1251971190232621056 2020-04-19 16:29:26 EDT <rraheem_p> Imagine if i was doing an honorlock exam, then bam! Xfinity outage üòÇ
1251956052280688647 2020-04-19 15:29:17 EDT <DanShenise> Not a week goes by without @xfinity having a multi-hour outage.
1251920540438114304 2020-04-19 13:08:11 EDT <monkeybrainsnet> If you know Mikrotik, @jobius set one up with failover. @henryzhansta - your antenna stats look good ... we did upgrade the firmware on 4/4/2020.  DM me your outages, and I'll try to correlate to events on our network.
1251877103542218753 2020-04-19 10:15:34 EDT <freddiebmusic90> Once again, it‚Äôs been two days with no Internet service and @Xfinity seems to not care. Luckily I was able to schedule a technician to come help later on. I truly hope you‚Äôre going to give credits and refunds for these outages you don‚Äôt want to own up to @Xfinity @comcastcares
1251837962154885120 2020-04-19 07:40:02 EDT <JJonesThe_3> this xfinity outage took my whole night from me
1251758471650742273 2020-04-19 02:24:10 EDT <BayAreaGooner88> @Xfinity second outage today, third in as many days. Can we expect some credits???! I know times are unique and a difficult but come on!! What‚Äôs happening? Fix this!
1251754089467314177 2020-04-19 02:06:46 EDT <jennjeanpierre> Every other day there is an outage from @Xfinity. Le sigh.
1251752725739474945 2020-04-19 02:01:20 EDT <SeonRiesland> @Xfinity is there an outage in Pleasanton!?
1251731626729635845 2020-04-19 00:37:30 EDT <CaliGood_> this is so ridiculous @Xfinity y‚Äôall have had an a outage every week and my bill is still $300. GO TO HELL  pic.twitter.com/OF4VfDEFCl
1251725386846699525 2020-04-19 00:12:42 EDT <TrumpIsAGrifter> @Xfinity  We‚Äôve had outages all day. No internet. No cable. Come on xfinity, really bad timing for repairs.
1251713441523433474 2020-04-18 23:25:14 EDT <riskaiiii> tfw you have to use your phone's hotspot because @xfinity constantly has outages this time of night
1251701441452015622 2020-04-18 22:37:33 EDT <SqueakySexton> @Xfinity this is the 4th time this week we have had an outage. At $200 a month you would think this wouldn‚Äôt be an issue. Either get your shit together or lower my bill. #suckstosuck
1251692902809571330 2020-04-18 22:03:38 EDT <Jake_Biondi> Why is @Xfinity and @comcast @comcastcares so awful in Chicago?  I have had nonstop outages for the past two weeks.  Terrible service when we need it most!
1251692857003372546 2020-04-18 22:03:27 EDT <jeffreyhooperjj> xfinity could not have had a better time to have an outage in fremont
1251677571651194882 2020-04-18 21:02:42 EDT <SheXRare> @Xfinity fix this outage now!!
1251667775803854851 2020-04-18 20:23:47 EDT <JazOutaControl> Xfinity has an outage every other damn day.  This shit is annoying
1251656938817048579 2020-04-18 19:40:43 EDT <sjkilleen> The amount of @Xfinity outages in our home has now reached the point where I'm writing scripts to grep our router's logs to document all of the outage times / minutes to show the pattern and demand refunds.
1251617545565716483 2020-04-18 17:04:11 EDT <XanityPlus> @comcast @Xfinity @comcastcares Somebody needs to explain to me why my internet suddenly kept going in and out every single hour yesterday & now is completely out and literally nothing is working. It won‚Äôt connect me to outage map, call scheduling, the phones won‚Äôt work. Nothing  pic.twitter.com/PIPcgEjNvU
1251602049097175046 2020-04-18 16:02:36 EDT <shaystarz> Just paid the bill an hour ago and no there‚Äôs an outage... I feel scammed @Xfinity #xfinity
1251594596557209600 2020-04-18 15:32:59 EDT <Tracy734G> @Xfinity your unreliability is exhausting. There should not be weekly random outages. Especially not at the monthly rate charged. ü§¨
1251559612282789892 2020-04-18 13:13:59 EDT <chaneybeverly_> Anothe outage .. @Xfinity  count your fucking days
1251546384173498368 2020-04-18 12:21:25 EDT <damigs> @comcastcares @Xfinity @comcast  .. nothing like waking up during stay at home quarantine to find out of an Xfinity outage in my area.   #sounreliable
1251543906648457218 2020-04-18 12:11:34 EDT <Lfh2121> Constant outages that‚Äôs BS Xfinity sucks!!!!!!! I demand a refund!!!!!!!!!
1251543680420364293 2020-04-18 12:10:40 EDT <Lfh2121> Constant outages Xfinity sucks!!!!!!
1251543039165845506 2020-04-18 12:08:07 EDT <Lfh2121> @comcastcares no solutions are ever offered for constant outages!!! I demand a refund!!!!!!Xfinity sucks!!!!!!!!
1251542674865303552 2020-04-18 12:06:40 EDT <Lfh2121> @comcastcares constant outages xfinity sucks
1251528367272230912 2020-04-18 11:09:49 EDT <CJPendragon> Gonna need someone to explain why there are no outages in my area but I have no internet.  "Issues detected. Please restart modem."  And 5 TIMES LATER, I'm being told the reset resolved the issue & yet still no internet.  @Xfinity costs too much for this shit.  Need new provider.
1251514610269782016 2020-04-18 10:15:09 EDT <klvdb74> This worked once before: our Comcast Internet has been unstable for 2 weeks shows outages in our zip code but I can‚Äôt report an outage. I‚Äôm in AI hell not getting help and no one listens. Comcast Xfinity Customer Service is beyond awful. @comcast @comcastcares
1251504109099851778 2020-04-18 09:33:26 EDT <MalorekHolyDark> Wish you guys were in my area. Century link charges the same prices for 9mbps and 0.1(yes less than 1)mbps up. Everyone is constantly complaining of outages, and slow speeds especially now when the hub that pings is 14 miles away. I feel like this should be criminal in some way.
1251500938025676804 2020-04-18 09:20:50 EDT <I_Show_Niggas> Great just fucking great there‚Äôs a xfinity outage in my area when i decide i wanna watch some shit on tv
1251485475577217025 2020-04-18 08:19:23 EDT <Lfh2121> @comcastcares and i accuse xfinity of having the worse internet service and worse customer service of all the providers. Constant outages no end in sight
1251483985622040577 2020-04-18 08:13:28 EDT <Lfh2121> Oh wow can‚Äôt wait, except i can because Xfinity sucks!!!!! Constant outages no solution in sight @comcastcares
1251479555589787648 2020-04-18 07:55:52 EDT <Lfh2121> And Xfinity Comcast sucks. I keep having constant outages no solution in sight!!! Comcast sucks!!!! @comcastcares
1251477559637954561 2020-04-18 07:47:56 EDT <Lfh2121> Comcast xfinity service Sucks!!!! Constant outages. There‚Äôs never a real solution!!!
1251477303907037185 2020-04-18 07:46:55 EDT <Lfh2121> Constant outages COMCAST XFINITY SUCKS!
1251469218035499009 2020-04-18 07:14:47 EDT <Bandit_JW> I checked and it doesn‚Äôt say there‚Äôs a Comcast / Xfinity internet outage, but it never says that there is when there actually is one ‚Äî so I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on.
1251454602576375814 2020-04-18 06:16:42 EDT <forgetandsmile> i really hate that @Xfinity is our only option for internet... multiple outages during a national state of emergency but NO lapses in payment. can't imagine what less fortunate families must be experiencing. can't wait until i NEVER have to deal with @comcast internet ever again
1251382844343160832 2020-04-18 01:31:34 EDT <GordonisAwesome> @Xfinity I've been having all kinds of issues with my Wi-Fi today. Frequent, lengthy disconnects of service. The app says my area has no outages, and the only advice it gives otherwise is to restart the router. Which I've done, multiple times, to no avail. Help.
1251377820783333378 2020-04-18 01:11:36 EDT <acdmorgan> @comcastcares my @Xfinity internet has been out for 24 hrs. Everytime I check the outage status, it‚Äôs pushed out longer. Can I get an accurate estimate for when it‚Äôll be restored?
1251362715471355909 2020-04-18 00:11:35 EDT <jonmarcantel> Jesus God. The poster child for frequent random outages is your preferred partner? Must be just for the teams you want to lose.
1251345150749491201 2020-04-17 23:01:47 EDT <Lalexdam> At this point I‚Äôm just amazed at how often @Xfinity has an outage in my area
1251330259267567617 2020-04-17 22:02:37 EDT <KaelArts> I remember when our internet a d cable and phone were out at work I had sent an outage report and within a minute got a text back about how everything had been fixed. I was like NO THE FECK IT HASN'T
1251318515530969090 2020-04-17 21:15:57 EDT <CetteMoiCindy> @Xfinity cant believe xfinity closes at 8pm. And at 8pm my modem stopped working. No wifi. #concast #xfinity #outage
1251307979711758337 2020-04-17 20:34:05 EDT <Victorh503> No outages and I‚Äôve restarted my internet 5 times. Why is it not working ? @Xfinity  pic.twitter.com/fQuwpHSMpC
1251294177540935680 2020-04-17 19:39:14 EDT <ZachariasLogan> The WiFi is out and I restarted the router and that didn‚Äôt fix it. So is there a outage in my area?
1251293810107318278 2020-04-17 19:37:46 EDT <Hey_DylanH> This would be easier to use if we had access to WiFi. Outages starting at 9am while we‚Äôre all working from and zero communication
1251287026600759299 2020-04-17 19:10:49 EDT <hmax17> I downloaded the app after restarting my pc, my router, and then my modem. It was then I realized there might be an outage. I hadn't a reason to check before then, hahha. Thank you for your cute reply tho! I needed a nice laugh üòä
1251286085050785794 2020-04-17 19:07:05 EDT <theelectwoman08> There has been an outage with my @Xfinity off and on all week. I‚Äôve been sitting here with no cable or internet for 6 hours. Had to use my phone as a hotspot to work.
1251285304209600513 2020-04-17 19:03:58 EDT <KBrownPR> Of course! It‚Äôs every afternoon! We spend hours on the phone w/ customer service  to hear y‚Äôall say ‚Äúnope no outages, and in fact that‚Äôs what happened when I took that pic! everyone in our neighborhood is having massive issues with their Comcast internet!
1251277625366138882 2020-04-17 18:33:28 EDT <mikeyrabedra> I would not mind an outage as much if @Xfinity would just acknowledge it and not pretend it is not happening. üò´
1251274705601994752 2020-04-17 18:21:52 EDT <Xfinity> Hey is there a notification in the My Account app about an outage?
1251271721795170305 2020-04-17 18:10:00 EDT <LeahKaz7> When our @Xfinity @comcastcares internet has been off and on and off for 12 hours but they keep telling us there is no outage. Awesome on these days we have no choice but to rely on them while we work at home with dropped Zoom calls all day üôÑ
1251271347684159489 2020-04-17 18:08:31 EDT <hmax17> I went five days without power here due to Tornados. They got it back on  today!!!...and there's an internet outage üòÇüòÇüòÇü§£ü§£ü§£üòÇ
1251266637543735296 2020-04-17 17:49:48 EDT <leaveit2suever> Have spent 1 hr each of the last 5 days w/ @Xfinity support to get an outage fixed (I even know the IP dropping packets) only to be told they cannot schedule a visit. They even told me my modem was online... too bad it was unplugged from the power. @ATT have any deals in my area?
1251259880549343237 2020-04-17 17:22:57 EDT <JustinsAMonster> I love my @Xfinity internet going out every 10-45 minutes for days on end. Just for their app to say there are no outages in my area :)
1251259013779488768 2020-04-17 17:19:30 EDT <KBrownPR> @xfinity amazingly ‚Äúno outages.‚Äù Can‚Äôt reach a human. THIS IS NOT OUR MODEM this is your service in our whole neighborhood.

1251248647674593280 2020-04-17 16:38:19 EDT <josette_grieve> Of course there is an Xfinity outage in my area on the first day of #couchlands ü§òüèΩüò©
1251231467964858369 2020-04-17 15:30:03 EDT <_gbar0> xfinity outage, again. great.
1251231212515012608 2020-04-17 15:29:02 EDT <ZachKlug> Your internet is about as reliable as Directv‚Äôs service. @Xfinity Working from home and you have a weekly outage.
1251227982724829188 2020-04-17 15:16:12 EDT <Xfinity> Check the Xfinity My Account app for outage information.
1251227625500139520 2020-04-17 15:14:47 EDT <Xfinity> Download the Xfinity My Account app - you can see if there is an outage, planned maintenance in the area and get help with troubleshooting steps.
1251225013115596804 2020-04-17 15:04:24 EDT <mykalona69> Xfinity customers in Orland Park/Mokena...anyone besides us have constant outages and issues with Internet and Cable???  We never get a solution but still pay a premium every month!  And just saw our wires left completely exposed over all winter...!! Really @comcast @Xfinity  pic.twitter.com/btlBpRbI1R
1251221497122893826 2020-04-17 14:50:26 EDT <Hey_DylanH> @Xfinity reporting an outage today since 9am. Gotten 3 messages that it was resolved and have been told now that it won‚Äôt actually be fixed until 5pm. It‚Äôs a good thing I can head to the office, or a coffee shop, or don‚Äôt have kids in elementary school with work to do...
1251216420836388870 2020-04-17 14:30:15 EDT <bibliocathy> DANGIT @Xfinity THIS IS A REALLY ANNOYING TIME TO HAVE OUR INTERNET GOING ON AND OFF  also, thanks for the three-hour outage yesterday üôÑ
1251205748169850880 2020-04-17 13:47:51 EDT <THElanrena> Why does xfinity have an outage. Rn is not the time üò≠
1251202553657937920 2020-04-17 13:35:09 EDT <icrystalgel> Half way into my Zoom class... @Xfinity hits me with a local outage #FINALSWEEEK pic.twitter.com/vZ0WldIm0c
1251171419100241922 2020-04-17 11:31:26 EDT <_RELLtalK> Xfinity HAS to know I don‚Äôt have time for outages right now!!!
1251146899500851201 2020-04-17 09:54:00 EDT <S__McBride> Hey @Xfinity I need notice if you're going to have an outage. You almost broke two servers today. I know you knew there was going to be an outage because I saw one of your trucks up the street about 10 min before my internet went down. This is unacceptable!!
1251146528384667650 2020-04-17 09:52:32 EDT <KiwiJello73> @Xfinity you told me to DM you my tech issue and I did. Then I was ignored. WTF? Our service is down due to YOUR lines, you blame us, and we have to wait for your techs to fix YOUR problem. This is not okay and the fact that it's being ignored as an outage is INFURIATING.
1251130940228636673 2020-04-17 08:50:35 EDT <KiwiJello73> No but you will leave customers off for OVER 24 hours who DID pay their bill. The outage is NOT our fault, but you aren't willing to do anything until TOMORROW. Unacceptable. Thank you for failing us and leaving us without the ability to do OUR JOBS. Bet you are getting paid.
1251130423645634560 2020-04-17 08:48:32 EDT <KiwiJello73> If that were remotely true, you wouldn't leave people with NO SERVICE for over 24 hours, especially when the outage is YOUR FAULT. You need EMERGENCY techs for people who lost service thru no fault of our own, yet WE get to suffer and lose money because YOUR service is down again
1251130211074224128 2020-04-17 08:47:41 EDT <Xfinity> Do you have the Xfinity My Account app? You can check the status of your services to see if there is an outage or planned maintenance.
1251066757244043265 2020-04-17 04:35:33 EDT <shangoesmoney> Can you guys please fix the signal I‚Äôm tired of these outages
1251063447577640961 2020-04-17 04:22:24 EDT <qk71> @Xfinity literally three days of on and off outages!!  pic.twitter.com/867xGxlae8
1251047093529120768 2020-04-17 03:17:25 EDT <SteelCity412ttv> How the hell do you report outages to @Xfinity? The virtual assistant is useless!
1250979997768208384 2020-04-16 22:50:48 EDT <SoyAlyRodriguez> @Xfinity do y‚Äôall have an outage in Spring, Texas? We‚Äôre trying to figure out what happened.
1250964923087273985 2020-04-16 21:50:54 EDT <Xfinity> There should be an estimate time of completion in the app. If not, we can look into this outage. Send us a DM here:  https://xfin.tv/support¬† , for assistance.
1250962413454872578 2020-04-16 21:40:55 EDT <Xfinity> Are you seeing any outage info in your My Account app?
1250961371807744002 2020-04-16 21:36:47 EDT <Heredia57Raul> I need to be credited on my bill for this outage 33326 ASAP also for lying to your customers which is very pathetic coming from a business they got everybody by the short Curley if there was another Internet service I would‚Äôve been there already so many years with Comcast BS
1250958536705740801 2020-04-16 21:25:31 EDT <davidsoto123> @Xfinity @comcastcares until when will the outage continue ?
1250958239694495744 2020-04-16 21:24:20 EDT <Vanetti_for_3> Hey @comcast @Xfinity we‚Äôve had 20 outages today (between 5 and 10 minutes each). Still counting. WYD #wfh #Unacceptable
1250955369687289856 2020-04-16 21:12:56 EDT <NickoIasThomas> Aint been on the game all day and right when I get on xfinity have an outage
1250944245453774848 2020-04-16 20:28:44 EDT <marilopez0931> internet and cable outage in my area for the padt FOUR HOURS! Wtf @Xfinity get it together!!!!
1250937354002534401 2020-04-16 20:01:21 EDT <BriKnow_> Has anyone else been having with random outages from @comcast @Xfinity throughout the day while working from home?
1250919063666282496 2020-04-16 18:48:40 EDT <HardTriggerJ> @Xfinity there‚Äôs an outage of both cable and internet in my house: zip code is 60477
1250900214732353536 2020-04-16 17:33:46 EDT <saraelliott78> So freakin frustrated with @Xfinity! 2 kids @ home trying to do school & I‚Äôm trying to work @ home & the Internet is down AGAIN! App just tells me there‚Äôs not an outage @ my address (even though there is), but there‚Äôs 1 in my ZIPcode! @comcastcares wtaf?!
1250897943676289025 2020-04-16 17:24:44 EDT <Xfinity> We can help. Have you been seeing any area outages in your My Account app?
1250893922966134784 2020-04-16 17:08:46 EDT <Xfinity> Have you tried this site:  https://comca.st/2K91u8v¬† . You can check outage information through there as well. Has resetting your modem improved your service at all?
1250889643270307840 2020-04-16 16:51:46 EDT <mattkrotzer> I remember two weeks ago, when @Xfinity was still providing fast, reliable internet service. Now I‚Äôm on my third outage in about a week.
1250886966989619200 2020-04-16 16:41:07 EDT <KBrownPR> @Xfinity we have rolling outages every afternoon. The only tech support we get is instructions to restart our modem. Not the issue! And your xfinitywifi DOESNT WORK! Right now our internet speed is akin to about 1991.  Or completely out. Yet your map will never show outages. #BS
1250886228796465152 2020-04-16 16:38:11 EDT <Xfinity> We want to help. Are you seeing any area outages showing in your My Account app?
1250885403009331201 2020-04-16 16:34:55 EDT <JoeBstro> Would have to agree with your side by side comparison. I'm salty about the amount of outages we've had with comcast, especially in MD. Fios at least for me rarely goes out and the connection speed is faster. But comcast services are far better which is why I stay. I'm trapped!!
1250863864662687745 2020-04-16 15:09:19 EDT <Maxine_Million> Xfinity been having outages the past 2 weeks smh
1250854822800240640 2020-04-16 14:33:24 EDT <Ddupreee> Why don't you try fixing all the ridiculous outages for hours on end instead of wasting your time on this nonsense
1250852385989287937 2020-04-16 14:23:43 EDT <DarkAngelRafael> @Xfinity I've been trying to reach @comcastcares for 7 days now. There was an outage last week that lasted all night.
1250850654282747907 2020-04-16 14:16:50 EDT <jbhammer> I checked and it showed an outage.  Looks like it just came back though.   Pittsburgh South Suburbs.
1250850180615868422 2020-04-16 14:14:57 EDT <Xfinity> We know how important reliable service is to you, and we appreciate your patience. We are taking a number of steps to ensure you remain connected to your Xfinity services. Please keep checking the My Account app for any outage updates.
1250849312520667139 2020-04-16 14:11:30 EDT <Xfinity> We know this outage is frustrating during this time. We're working to fix this ASAP.
1250848465590116353 2020-04-16 14:08:08 EDT <Xfinity> Hi, when this happens, have there been outage notifications in the My Account app for you?
1250845640256401408 2020-04-16 13:56:54 EDT <StraightSubs> Checked in the website for outages says nothing wrong in my area. But it has been up and down since morning
1250845136017186816 2020-04-16 13:54:54 EDT <seb_uk> wonder why @xfinity needs to hide its outage map behind a login page? It's nearly as if they don't want non-customers to see how many outages they have before buying...  pic.twitter.com/C3fcstDm8P
1250841401178406912 2020-04-16 13:40:04 EDT <DWick23> @comcastcares @Xfinity you‚Äôre killing me right now. Internet keeps cutting in and out despite ‚Äúno outages in my area‚Äù.  pic.twitter.com/244rDdrnt2
1250836955987947521 2020-04-16 13:22:24 EDT <1Thunder_Struck> It has resumed, thank you. 16-hour outage if all services.
1250836904259530757 2020-04-16 13:22:12 EDT <jasonkeisling> No outages.
1250835960633458689 2020-04-16 13:18:27 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked your My Account app to see if there's an outage reported?
1250834369012477955 2020-04-16 13:12:07 EDT <Xfinity> Is there an outage reported in your area? You can check on your My Account app.
1250831234361671681 2020-04-16 12:59:40 EDT <soxmachine_josh> Anybody else having issues with @Xfinity Internet at home? Our connection just stopped again like yesterday's outage.
1250821633763356674 2020-04-16 12:21:31 EDT <APtheProducer> Xfinity outage till 4pm tf am I supposed to do now

1250804733855612930 2020-04-16 11:14:22 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked your My Account app to see if there's an outage reported in your area?
1250803911516213248 2020-04-16 11:11:05 EDT <LaLaBeChillin> Welp xfinity decoded they wanna have an outage.
1250803126485090310 2020-04-16 11:07:58 EDT <bansheBUTTAZ> Xfinity ALWAYS does this inconvenience stuff with doing ‚Äúwork‚Äù in your area causing internet/cable outages and NEVER tell you or give a heads up. A simple e-mail of ‚ÄúHey we‚Äôll be working...‚Äù would suffice.
1250800205856833536 2020-04-16 10:56:22 EDT <johngzz_> Is someone at xfinity just unplugging my internet every few hours? Outage map doesn‚Äôt show any issues in my area #comcast #xfinity
1250796189408165888 2020-04-16 10:40:24 EDT <JpcDeux> Another day another @Xfinity outage. Makes #elearning and #Homeschooling2020 real fun. #GetYourLife #WTF #COVID19 #Covid_19 #Xfinity
1250795817696473094 2020-04-16 10:38:56 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked your My Account app to see if there's an outage reported in the area?
1250773050230034432 2020-04-16 09:08:28 EDT <Xfinity> Hey! If you're in an area outage, you don't need to do anything -- we're working to get you back up and running ASAP, so keep an eye on your app for updates.

1250682427590111232 2020-04-16 03:08:21 EDT <inkspillz> Xfinity outage!
1250682059888013312 2020-04-16 03:06:54 EDT <go_nelly> @Xfinity How about you tell me why there‚Äôs an outage in area code 49525?! Kinda random in the middle of the night during a fricking pandemic, no bad weather or anything. And we‚Äôve never lost internet connection for this long, not ever. ü§¨
1250665387512991745 2020-04-16 02:00:39 EDT <sloanstar78> @Xfinity After 9 months of the most abysmal service... I will just resort to public shaming. Another outage... but everything looks good!  pic.twitter.com/92L3qqMMSn
1250652510869581831 2020-04-16 01:09:29 EDT <BastardGrimm> How often does it go down for you? When I had a major outage problem every week, it was the tap going into my apartment's building that was damaged. It would just go out randomly and Comcast had to come and switch cables to different endpoints, and someone else got the bad one.
1250642210737053696 2020-04-16 00:28:33 EDT <FBFlamingo> @Xfinity how about you do something useful and restore the outage in the Lancaster PA area. Can‚Äôt work from home, or survive this nightmare quarantine without the internet
1250641727146414080 2020-04-16 00:26:38 EDT <omalley_XL> its not xfinity if there is never an outage every 5 minutes for every single day
1250640728868261888 2020-04-16 00:22:40 EDT <abbysrightarm> Xfinity outage üòî but at least I can watch on my iPad
1250619794476478465 2020-04-15 22:59:29 EDT <_iJustRun> @Xfinity I‚Äôm tired of this unreliable connection! You guys are pathetic! How is it that 2 of my routers, at 2 different locations aren‚Äôt working?! There‚Äôre no outages but my internet is down! Run me my money for my accounts!
1250616785000374272 2020-04-15 22:47:31 EDT <cdagod> @Xfinity how on Earth do you have an outage when you know the whole country is at home??? Please fix in Bloomingdale, IL.  pic.twitter.com/qVFagQxsGX

1250611448092545024 2020-04-15 22:26:19 EDT <tg_nash215> There‚Äôs an outage in my area.. what a shame.  I‚Äôve seen so many reports of outages within the last few days.
1250590260007890944 2020-04-15 21:02:07 EDT <1Two3eedy> @comcastcares @Xfinity One job. Connectivity. You already fail every day. Service outages with no refunds. In a global pandemic, you think you‚Äôd have better ethics. No. Bet you figured out how to profit from this though.
1250571551067553797 2020-04-15 19:47:46 EDT <Xfinity> What's going on with your internet? Are you in an area outage?
1250571517794168838 2020-04-15 19:47:38 EDT <ALKuzmich_1031> Any chance those trucks are still there? Now they‚Äôre telling me there are no outages   in our area...but my cable and internet are still down and can‚Äôt get any help through their website üôÉ

1250528817996857344 2020-04-15 16:57:58 EDT <Xfinity> We know any down time can be frustrating. Are you seeing an estimate time of completion of this outage?
1250528744965459968 2020-04-15 16:57:41 EDT <WereGeek> GRAR! Xfinity is down, meaning I can't work. Rebooted the router but Xfi still says there's a local outage. [headdesk]

1250454461123887106 2020-04-15 12:02:30 EDT <Xfinity> You can always check the status of your service for outage or maintenance information through the Xfinity My Account app.

1250409748589051905 2020-04-15 09:04:50 EDT <Xfinity> Hi there. Hope your services are back up and running. So you know - the Xfinity My Account app will keep you updated with what's going on; whether it be maintenance or an outage in the area.
1250403534199304195 2020-04-15 08:40:08 EDT <Xfinity> You can always check the Xfinity My Account app to check the status of your service and to see if there are any outages or planned maintenance going on in the area. How's your connection now?
1250378982220009472 2020-04-15 07:02:34 EDT <tg_nash215> @Xfinity my wifi has been really SLOW within the last 2 hours.   Bill is paid, no other devices are on.  Just my TV in my room, I keep seeing others complaining of outages.  Any relation?
1250279999858327555 2020-04-15 00:29:15 EDT <webster_tech> @Xfinity is definitely making this #Quarantine worse. Not a week has gone by where my internet hasn't gone out for at least a small window. Here I am again, with no internet - but @comcast says there's no outage in my area. #fixit #comcastoutage
1250262465025388545 2020-04-14 23:19:35 EDT <PhaetosL> Just can‚Äôt catch a break for my stream. Got power but @Xfinity has decided to now have an outage. üòî
1250240752040452096 2020-04-14 21:53:18 EDT <Hexxusss> I‚Äôve had fios for the past 2.5 years and only ever had one outage. Xfinity had outages at least once a month when I had them and when Miah had them before switching.
1250212817183166471 2020-04-14 20:02:18 EDT <Xfinity> We can look into what's causing this to happen. Are you in any area outages in your My Account app?
1250201747152424962 2020-04-14 19:18:18 EDT <Xfinity> Was the outage notification completely removed, or just the estimated time of resolution?
1250201357472215047 2020-04-14 19:16:45 EDT <blackboltmagic> I was sitting here ready to have a relaxing night of Westworld catch up. And BOOM, @xfinity WiFi outage.  pic.twitter.com/JcGtjSD2gb
1250200194358161408 2020-04-14 19:12:08 EDT <nealpiliavin> rcn outage 2nd one today in milton mass @RCNconnects @Xfinity
1250197659723448323 2020-04-14 19:02:04 EDT <_aaaalyak> @Xfinity This Is Really UNACCEPTABLE Every Week It‚Äôs An Outage
1250191229968621569 2020-04-14 18:36:31 EDT <Xfinity> We know this is frustrating during this time. Are you seeing an estimated end time for this outage?
1250187208746770433 2020-04-14 18:20:32 EDT <DonaldChambers> Checked the my account app as well. Shows no outages
1250183304256655360 2020-04-14 18:05:01 EDT <Xfinity> Let's see what's going on. Are you seeing any area outages showing in your My Account app?
1250181508687593472 2020-04-14 17:57:53 EDT <applextree> It's going out every 30 seconds. Just checked the app and there aren't outages.
1250174508398305281 2020-04-14 17:30:04 EDT <SecOfBitcoin> Had an outage last week on my personal broadband but that's pretty typical for Xfinity  Overall we are pretty lucky where we are. Most residents in the area are old af and not using the internet much. But I am seeing/hearing more from friends and business partners
1250173879672360961 2020-04-14 17:27:34 EDT <othertimdavis> Bob, my 6 hour outage does not compare. I am glad I still have packet radio node available.
1250164575258832897 2020-04-14 16:50:36 EDT <hishivang> @Xfinity you have a outage in Sacramento, your phone number is busy...when can we expect to get it fixed?  pic.twitter.com/98tF4qPwVA
1250157030477910018 2020-04-14 16:20:37 EDT <antoniopuesan> It‚Äôs just me or @Xfinity has an outage in my 33186 area  Speed is very low!
1250152832872984576 2020-04-14 16:03:56 EDT <JOONSimmer> hello @Xfinity @comcast nows a real bad time to be having an outage I have a meeting in 5 minutes through zoom on my laptop üòî
1250152809712017408 2020-04-14 16:03:51 EDT <JainaFSolo> @Xfinity how much longer you guys said 2:40 and it‚Äôs way pass that still outage in 60202 area.  This ridiculous
1250145453984886784 2020-04-14 15:34:37 EDT <kingoftheswipe> @Xfinity y‚Äôall messing up some much needed instructional time with these outages, Bucko! Gonna have us finishing up assignments well into the leave daddy the hell alone portion of the day, and I ain‚Äôt for it!
1250133903064662016 2020-04-14 14:48:43 EDT <PulOutNWalkAwaY> Xfinity will have an outage and there won‚Äôt be shit going on. I hate it here
1250123696708214786 2020-04-14 14:08:10 EDT <p_ashburn> It‚Äôs been well over an hour now.  I‚Äôm seeing tweets about internet outages around the country but none from my area.  As I said, be better.
1250115074271973378 2020-04-14 13:33:54 EDT <Xfinity> Hey Ben. Is there an outage reported in your area?
1250111563228381184 2020-04-14 13:19:57 EDT <Xfinity> Are you in an area outage?
1250110106945142785 2020-04-14 13:14:10 EDT <Xfinity> Hey. If you're in an outage, rest assured we're working to get you back up and running ASAP.
1250108736053665793 2020-04-14 13:08:43 EDT <chiefsbride> The gateway is fine. It's your service that keeps going out! Outage notices every day!
1250103243163807751 2020-04-14 12:46:53 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Maureen. Have you looked at your My Account app to see if there's an outage reported in your area?
1250084694277980161 2020-04-14 11:33:11 EDT <enockrodriguez_> Xfinity service outages while you have class>>>>>>>
1250083301756370945 2020-04-14 11:27:39 EDT <flipb18b> @Xfinity is there an outage at 455 Boston Post RD Old Saybrook CT ?
1250082766013767681 2020-04-14 11:25:31 EDT <reh_beeXII> Yes, there was reports of outages in my zip code without reason. I rebooted my router 3 times. I guess 3rd times a charm.
1250082317915361282 2020-04-14 11:23:44 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked your My Account app to see if there's an outage reported in your area?
1250075350224289796 2020-04-14 10:56:03 EDT <krysssssss7> @Xfinity no internet and no tv, app isn‚Äôt showing an outage, I‚Äôve already done basic troubleshooting steps. Wtf I work from home and need the internet.
1250074091849232385 2020-04-14 10:51:03 EDT <BoundarylayerB> Always fun to have an @Xfinity internet outage mid conference call.
1250074084358213633 2020-04-14 10:51:01 EDT <gojo2424> @comcastcares @comcast @Xfinity outage after outage and you just don‚Äôt care?? Just sad
1250074054326980615 2020-04-14 10:50:54 EDT <cardfanatic23> @Xfinity you also keep telling everyone to check the outage map but mine said this would be fixed at 11pm last night. It‚Äôs now 11am. 24 hours without service. Hopefully we get prorated monthly costs, right?
1250073786067701761 2020-04-14 10:49:50 EDT <cmchico> #xfinity an outage AND routine maintenance at the same time?!  When most of the country is working from home and/or e-learning?! Most companies perform routine maintenance during overnight hours to prevent disruption, just FYI.  This #outage is unacceptable!
1250068646749261825 2020-04-14 10:29:25 EDT <Xfinity> Check the Xfinity My Account app to see if there is an outage or maintenance happening in your area.
1250064743827746820 2020-04-14 10:13:54 EDT <Cizzurp215> I have. It says there is an outage.
1250059838291431427 2020-04-14 09:54:25 EDT <Xfinity> Is there an outage or maintenance reported through the Xfinity My Account app?
1250057724571848708 2020-04-14 09:46:01 EDT <hamletcooper> Like I said one tweet up, I can't log in bc it's my roommates acct. Internet came back at like 2am anyways. It's a v flawed system. @EversourceMA doesn't make me log in in order to see power outage maps--its publicly accessible information
1250049218586259460 2020-04-14 09:12:13 EDT <xgator313x> @Xfinity @comcast it's really frustrating not being able to get through to a human to be able to find out why my cable service has been out since yesterday. Internet, On Demand and phone are good, no TV though. Are there outages or what?
1250048459652112385 2020-04-14 09:09:12 EDT <ComcastSouth> After this week‚Äôs storms, we‚Äôve been working hard to restore Xfinity services. As power returns to areas, and it becomes safe for our techs & restoration crews, we will be repairing any damages affecting our network.

1250048402290851842 2020-04-14 09:08:58 EDT <_the_foundry> Yes and there are no issues. Also - you're outage map is not very helpful.
1250046306271342592 2020-04-14 09:00:38 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked your My Account app to see if there's an outage listed?
1250039475675303938 2020-04-14 08:33:30 EDT <Xfinity> You can pull up the Xfinity My Account app to see all outage details in your area.

1249984487699537921 2020-04-14 04:55:00 EDT <MediocreMace> The Internet outages are making it impossible to do any work and the fact that you can't call anyone is the worst part @Xfinity you absolutely suck
1249982828336410624 2020-04-14 04:48:24 EDT <AresTheBot> Internet outage... Smh Xfinity figure it tf out! I'll be back when i can!

1249953165795082241 2020-04-14 02:50:32 EDT <5iveEyez> Total Comcast outage in Colorado. Internet and cable. The Xfinity app accredits the outage to  normal maintenance from 12:07 am to 6:00 am Tuesday morning. This was not communicated to us st all. My tv is stuck on this freeze frame. Amy one else confirm?  pic.twitter.com/HSHvzwXfCC

1249935819009384448 2020-04-14 01:41:36 EDT <oliversportboy> @Xfinity @comcastcares internet outage in quarantine üòî you hate to see it
1249905188246339584 2020-04-13 23:39:53 EDT <_brooke_garcia> @Xfinity @comcast Do you know what‚Äôs causing the internet outage in Memphis? The outage time has been extended once already. Just trying to see if it will affect my #WorkFromHome tomorrow! Thank you! @comcastcares
1249869807656329218 2020-04-13 21:19:18 EDT <cardfanatic23> @Xfinity ridiculous how we‚Äôre all working from home and metro Atlanta has an outage for 12 hours. Can‚Äôt wait to switch companies. Terrible service.
1249866005230137346 2020-04-13 21:04:11 EDT <SteveWeinstock> A complete @comcast @Xfinity outage (internet and TV) in my neighborhood during a quarantine is just mean.
1249862316574662656 2020-04-13 20:49:32 EDT <andremuraro> If you think of internet speed and reliability, never think @comcast @xfinity.  They always say their network is working well and fast, while thousands of customers are complaining on internet. #xfinity outage
1249840161187336192 2020-04-13 19:21:29 EDT <AllieStormborn> Thanks @Xfinity for the outage during the worlds house arrest.
1249837223027105793 2020-04-13 19:09:49 EDT <Snugs01> @Xfinity then all of a sudden NO CONNECTION! Is there a mass outage somewhere in NJ?
1249836353766002689 2020-04-13 19:06:22 EDT <wtfdoll> Xfinity WiFi is starting to suck ass... these niggas always having outages
1249829606993133576 2020-04-13 18:39:33 EDT <RobertBlenkle> Outage was supposed to be restored by 2:45pm. It is now 6:30 and no status update besides saying it was supposed to be restored by 2:45pm. A little update would be nice being that it is now nearing 4 hours after estimated time. no word from you folks on when we should expect it
1249813031246270464 2020-04-13 17:33:41 EDT <hamletcooper> I can't log into my account to see the outage map--my roommate has the account and he's self isolating w/ his parents. Why can't I just see the outage map on the website? Don't want the public to know how often Comcast service is down? XD --in Boston
1249808475737206789 2020-04-13 17:15:35 EDT <escandal0so> THERES IS NEVER AN OUTAGE IN MY AREA BUT MY INTERNET IS ALWAYS OUT!?!??!?!?! #xfinity is trash.
1249805314016325634 2020-04-13 17:03:01 EDT <likethesauce_> Xfinity has an outage. Wonderful
1249803823436017664 2020-04-13 16:57:06 EDT <winquinnwin> Man the @comcastcares has just been terrible.  Over the past two weeks, we‚Äôve experienced our first-ever outages (during normal business hours) and my down speed hasn‚Äôt been over 20 mbps once (paying for 500 mbps). Tech support never calls on the callback. ü§Æ
1249797588372672515 2020-04-13 16:32:19 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Tanner. Keep checking the My account app for outage updates. If you need assistance with your payments our support team can take a look at your account. Send us a DM here:  https://xfin.tv/support¬†.
1249796655928532992 2020-04-13 16:28:37 EDT <socalgamecock> No outages reported for the area

1249794176595767303 2020-04-13 16:18:46 EDT <KeriAnnsBabii> I‚Äôm so tired of @Xfinity @comcast and these outages.
1249785718446198784 2020-04-13 15:45:09 EDT <Mikey_P_13> I'm going to get fired because @comcast can't go a single work day without an hour long outage. Thanks, Xfinity for being more unreliable than the president of the United States during a global pandemic!
1249783425659265026 2020-04-13 15:36:03 EDT <unusuallyeric> i‚Äôm in the middle of my insecure binge and xfinity want to have an outage .... like right now of all times smh
1249775409991999488 2020-04-13 15:04:12 EDT <ComcastSouth> If you are experiencing a loss of XFINITY services due to today's severe weather conditions, please be aware that this could be the result of a local power outage and/or damage to our network that serves your neighborhood.

1249771067536801792 2020-04-13 14:46:56 EDT <abcdefGINA16> Every day I experience outages from @Xfinity @comcast    Any way we can close the gaps in poor service/signal?
1249769303152435202 2020-04-13 14:39:56 EDT <XypherOrion> The same Issue I've had since January, had two technician visits for, and was promised would be monitored from your end. I've had consistent internet outages daily, which my viewers would gladly attest to, and my upload is extremely inconsistent.
1249767396082094081 2020-04-13 14:32:21 EDT <elaineATLHealth> If you login to your account, from your phone, go to support and there will be a link to the outage overview....your welcome(legal disclaimee: I dont work for xfiniti) lol
1249767340574683138 2020-04-13 14:32:08 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked your My Account app to see if there is an outage reported?
1249766645729460226 2020-04-13 14:29:22 EDT <wphamilton> Hey @Xfinity is it truly impossible to say "There is a network outage in your area" without forcing me thru your absurd system, hold times, stupidly resetting, & obnoxious agents? For 90 minutes plus?
1249761244682301440 2020-04-13 14:07:54 EDT <_killbabyd> I have to process payroll by the end of today for 300 employees and @Xfinity wants to fuck up... unacceptable this is the third time within two weeks that we have an outage
1249760931837607937 2020-04-13 14:06:40 EDT <ANGIEE_RC> #Xfinity is forever having an outage... FUCK THEM!!.
1249760278977433607 2020-04-13 14:04:04 EDT <sluttysunflower> looks like it‚Äôs back up but if you could send anything stating that their was an outage for a period of time that would be great.
1249759998529302528 2020-04-13 14:02:57 EDT <devnte> When we thought quarantining couldn‚Äôt get any worse, @Xfinity has an outage
1249759873698533384 2020-04-13 14:02:27 EDT <sluttysunflower> i‚Äôm unable to log into the account on browser as well. the account owner has tried setting up an xfinity ID and does not have the information they‚Äôre asking for. i just need something stating that is an outage at this address.
1249758894055964673 2020-04-13 13:58:34 EDT <sluttysunflower> @Xfinity i work from home and am having an outage. can i please get some kind of documentation stating that i am experiencing an outage that i can give my employer? i am unable to login to the app.
1249755047627493377 2020-04-13 13:43:17 EDT <Xfinity> Did you check your My Account app to see if there's a reported outage in your area?
1249748794385858567 2020-04-13 13:18:26 EDT <Xfinity> Are you experiencing an area outage?
1249748194927443971 2020-04-13 13:16:03 EDT <bbekah23> Alright xfinity y‚Äôall know EVERYBODY working from home. How y‚Äôall having outages?!?!
1249743768183504900 2020-04-13 12:58:28 EDT <lugal> Here‚Äôs a suggestion: actually have a way for customers to report outages.
1249741795237531651 2020-04-13 12:50:37 EDT <lugal> That link doesn‚Äôt display the banner that it says it would, so there‚Äôs no way to report an outage. I can‚Äôt believe that you just raised my monthly bill by $40 and still deliver such shockingly bad service.
1249732891187261440 2020-04-13 12:15:14 EDT <disnazzio> I‚Äôve had wifi and cable for about 1 of every 10 minutes for the last hour, and this is also true at my office that is less than 2 miles away, but xfinity helpfully assured me that there is no outage in my area so I guess I‚Äôll just use that assurance to log in and continue working
1249723818643464194 2020-04-13 11:39:11 EDT <tbelles> Yet, again. ANOTHER @Xfinity WEEKLY outage.
1249719816321150981 2020-04-13 11:23:17 EDT <kingblenkle> @Xfinity internet has been down for about an hour is there an outage in the are?
1249713576153157634 2020-04-13 10:58:29 EDT <Xfinity> Hey there. Check your My Account app for info on outages.
1249712924509290497 2020-04-13 10:55:54 EDT <johnoto12> @Xfinity working from home. Is there an internet outage in metro Atlanta?
1249709972935643137 2020-04-13 10:44:10 EDT <Jay_Lundyy> @Xfinity my internet just stopped is there an outage or something.
1249707835124068353 2020-04-13 10:35:40 EDT <lugal> Hey @Xfinity, I‚Äôm trying to report a total outage in my neighborhood, but there‚Äôs no way to do so through your useless automated help lines.
1249704190508773376 2020-04-13 10:21:12 EDT <JTFouquier> @Xfinity @comcast Seriously‚Ä¶ No one needs to sign in to see an Internet outage map from their cell phone. It used to be that I could see the map without logging in. Extra hurdles and annoyances when internet is down and I can‚Äôt work. üôÑüëç
1249703790938402816 2020-04-13 10:19:36 EDT <miamakeupartist> @Xfinity @comcastcares this is unacceptable. I am being forced to use my data and cannot work due to an outage. I have made several attempts to speak to someone regarding this with no response. Even attempted using chat.
1249702213410152448 2020-04-13 10:13:20 EDT <johnsonp25> I've checked down everything. Outage map, restart modem, chat agent restarted modem, chat agent restarted modem again, new chat agent restarted modem, wholesale reset, new chat agent says there's no issue with my connectivity but I can't connect to anything. What can I do here?
1249695033290371072 2020-04-13 09:44:48 EDT <Xfinity> Hey there. Have you downloaded the Xfinity My Account app to see if there was an outage in the area?
1249689941296242695 2020-04-13 09:24:34 EDT <wewantMor_> @Xfinity talking about this wifi outage wont be fixed until 2pm ... it‚Äôs time to start this week over already
1249682324364681216 2020-04-13 08:54:18 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Joe. Download the Xfinity My Account app so you can check for outages, maintenance and troubleshoot your connection.
1249674802589204480 2020-04-13 08:24:25 EDT <Xfinity> Hey Kenneth. Have you checked your My Account app to see if you're in an outage?
1249674785426001921 2020-04-13 08:24:21 EDT <10acious_Diva> i just realized why my internet hasn't been working for a few days because of an outage with xfinity!!! fck! I have lots of work to do!
1249672987231637506 2020-04-13 08:17:12 EDT <andreapurplejs> Service outage in North Port, FL since yesterday afternoon. I can‚Äôt work üò≠ @Xfinity it‚Äôs saying now it will be back tomorrow! @comcastcares
1249666269525221378 2020-04-13 07:50:30 EDT <Leauxkey404> 4th damn outage in a week.. count ya fukn days @Xfinity  pic.twitter.com/qu4QmiLHbY
1249665374049710080 2020-04-13 07:46:57 EDT <JamesonHayes> @Xfinity do you currently have outages in Tuscaloosa, AL?
1249589637988995072 2020-04-13 02:46:00 EDT <Shady_girl_AF> Here we go again with @Xfinity with their outage! @comcastcares some of us need the Internet for school and work.
1249581103507177473 2020-04-13 02:12:05 EDT <chaneybeverly_> @Xfinity  really sucks. $300 service just to gave a outage and isn‚Äôt able to speak with anyone about restoring. FIX IT ASAP
1249520311596449793 2020-04-12 22:10:31 EDT <K_youloveher> They‚Äôve been having hella outages!
1249512013757374466 2020-04-12 21:37:33 EDT <BuenoMarisa> @Xfinity Internet outage for 4 hours now. Tried chatting with agent, was told to call because there are not chat agents. I call, no reps available and told to try chat.
1249497814004125696 2020-04-12 20:41:08 EDT <CMooreButts11> RT if this happens to you for at least 10 days of every month with no local outages present...  @Xfinity aren‚Äôt you all supposed to be in the big leagues?  pic.twitter.com/WjDUt4MXmx
1249494459361918979 2020-04-12 20:27:48 EDT <HouseCoop> @Xfinity my Internet has been out, going on 4 hours now. What is being done to fix this? Your customers pay monthly but the service is not available for the entire month. There needs to be pro-rated fees when outages occur.
1249492245696393224 2020-04-12 20:19:00 EDT <missillie> You do realize they are having huge channel outages across the US? My boxes won't stop resetting themselves due to a massive outage in my area. Maybe try seeing if you have an outage in your area before you accuse them of such a crazy thing.
1249489082427768832 2020-04-12 20:06:26 EDT <tbformayor> @Xfinity chose the right time to have an outage üòí
1249486254925905920 2020-04-12 19:55:12 EDT <Xfinity> We can help if you've been having issues with your service. Are you seeing any outages showing in your My Account app?
1249484626931920902 2020-04-12 19:48:44 EDT <Xfinity> We want to help with this connection issue. Are you seeing any area outages or scheduled maintenance in your My Account app?
1249473231028961282 2020-04-12 19:03:27 EDT <hopemaga> Of all the #COVID19 days, Comcast Xfinity chose this Easter Sunday for an outage in some cities in the Bay Area, California. It is a #CoronaVirusChallenge not having Comcast @Xfinity service on internet, TV & mobile phones while #StayingParkedStayingSafe at home. Disappointed!
1249467171245342720 2020-04-12 18:39:22 EDT <TaliasSexyMama> @Xfinity @comcastcares @comcast I need assistance with my service immediately. Having no one answer your line and the app not working is unacceptable once you have my money. I need my internet for work! And cable for quarantine. No word of outage and no outstanding balance!
1249462385435435010 2020-04-12 18:20:21 EDT <NewkThaGod> TBD; just started.  Will update for DC tweeps currently enjoying the citywide outage.
1249426945080778754 2020-04-12 15:59:31 EDT <mychalherber> Nothing like a good ol‚Äô internet outage to round out the weekend üôÉ @Xfinity
1249425013582827520 2020-04-12 15:51:51 EDT <tirWrestling> You know what goes good with stay at home orders? An Xfinity service outage!  pic.twitter.com/9OZZIDVDQE
1249415456961765378 2020-04-12 15:13:52 EDT <DupontCircleDC> Anyone else having Comcast / Xfinity internet outage in DC?
1249412658169700352 2020-04-12 15:02:45 EDT <reda19xx> No outage - Comcast is fully aware that at least 3 apartments in the building lost connection at the same exact time on Wed. The so-called local rep keeps saying that she is working on sending a tech over- but she's been saying that since Thursday! #lazy
1249410848105172992 2020-04-12 14:55:33 EDT <ChiveMePlease> Another outage here as well. 3rd one in a month...2 hours since it went out.
1249410716488122368 2020-04-12 14:55:02 EDT <Xfinity> We want to look into what's going on with your service. Have you been in an area outage during this time? If so, do you see any updates in your My Account app?
1249407504502665216 2020-04-12 14:42:16 EDT <StyxDragon> Hey @Xfinity if you could end the outage and give me internet back...  pic.twitter.com/vaSfcku1Gg

1249392140930748416 2020-04-12 13:41:13 EDT <TLOW19> @Xfinity my internet is horribly always outage ! If your a gamer like me @Xfinity is not for you! Not even getting the speeds I pay for üò°
1249361999697453057 2020-04-12 11:41:27 EDT <Ryno729> @Xfinity - Our Internet is down more than it's working. Get it together! Another outage. Even when it's working, we don't get speeds fast enough to even stream.
1249350771856101378 2020-04-12 10:56:50 EDT <AeroGuy724> @Xfinity y'all need to get this together!!! This is the i dont know how many day there's been an outage in my area!!ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨  pic.twitter.com/pP5yKeS7zl

1249319576782995457 2020-04-12 08:52:52 EDT <MyBrainHurts9> Same for me. The only day I had any server issues, it turned out that there was an xfinity outage in my area. Outside of that, I‚Äôve had no network areas and very few of the other issues people complain about.
1249301865684185090 2020-04-12 07:42:30 EDT <sxurjm> thank you for responding to my outage so quickly.  how can I get my hands on a new xfinity WiFi 6 router?
1249191393790230532 2020-04-12 00:23:31 EDT <soonenator> Look quarantine isn‚Äôt so bad until you have a @Xfinity outage and you realize you can‚Äôt watch or play half the things you want to
1249162329822056452 2020-04-11 22:28:02 EDT <Lalexdam> Holy shit another fucking outage? Fuck @Xfinity and their shitty, overpriced service
1249150638145114112 2020-04-11 21:41:34 EDT <Lalexdam> Once again, fuck @Xfinity. We've been having "outages" all week which makes it hard to work from home
1249148794630963202 2020-04-11 21:34:15 EDT <johngrogg> It is literally impossible to get a person to help with an @Xfinity  internet outage from @comcastcares   F- grade, will find new service ASAP, assuming there are other options üò≠üò§
1249138066356387842 2020-04-11 20:51:37 EDT <tmount> Haven't had an outage with Fios in 18 months... But, Xfinity seems better priced, and just a better service overall... All that said, I really want to just get to paying for internet and separate the TV aspect. (if I did that, it'd be Fios)
1249137951952572416 2020-04-11 20:51:10 EDT <melisa_aaaaa> Service outage in Lafayette, CO. Xfinity shit's about to get real.  pic.twitter.com/TQTSbkuPgI

1248720448709263360 2020-04-10 17:12:09 EDT <huntingmyths> Fucking pissed off with @Xfinity. We have had multiple outages every day and nothing is being done to resolve them.
1248719236576526337 2020-04-10 17:07:20 EDT <IAmMeAreYouU> @comcastcares I have sent several DMs regarding the service outage from yesterday. Can you please respond? @xfinity told me to DM you and I haven‚Äôt heard back at all.
1248717797057875973 2020-04-10 17:01:37 EDT <AudHaley> Thank you @Xfinity @comcast for continuously having outages in my area. As a college student you are making my life 10x harder.

1248654342942527491 2020-04-10 12:49:28 EDT <Xfinity> Hi. Is there an are outage listed in your My Account app?
1248654086813011968 2020-04-10 12:48:27 EDT <Blck_Ty> @Xfinity can we get one week? One whole week where we don‚Äôt need to disconnect and reconnect our modems/routers? It‚Äôs always something. And now there‚Äôs an outage. There should be some sort of refund given for each outage. These companies are something else.
1248651413808447489 2020-04-10 12:37:50 EDT <PlNKNOlZE> @Xfinity service outage.... FOR FOUR HOURS??????????????
1248650633126621184 2020-04-10 12:34:44 EDT <rojtaszoo> @Xfinity Who the hell plans an outage in zip code 95831 during a quarantine when people are working from home and need it to get a paycheck? Is it business critical to do? I hope you‚Äôre going to compensate people for the outage since they can‚Äôt work.
1248638752181948420 2020-04-10 11:47:31 EDT <WoodWhisperer> An Xfinity outage killed the Woodworking Morning Show today. We will try to do a PM show this evening.

1248626767297798149 2020-04-10 10:59:54 EDT <helepoleo> Dear @Xfinity this is the second time this week I have an outage of internet and cable service at home. When I check my account on my phone it says that there is no outage in my area, again. Please get your act together, since you still charge me over $300 a month no matter what.
1248609342040846338 2020-04-10 09:50:39 EDT <FocusedOnBeer> Ugh @Xfinity web streaming SUCKS today. I see @comcast has outages in Camden County, wondering if that's hitting me too.  Seriously considering switching to @hulu
1248584819019309056 2020-04-10 08:13:13 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Tyree. Hope you're services are back up and running. If you don't have it downloaded, check out the Xfinity My Account app. You can get information about outages in the area, do troubleshooting if your connection seems slow and plenty more!

1248378906039615490 2020-04-09 18:34:59 EDT <RedEyesWhitePu1> Of course it does. It‚Äôs listed the same outage with the same update of ‚Äúit will be fixed as soon as possible‚Äù since 7:40am when it began. It‚Äôs now been 9+ hours without internet and we are unable to do our jobs/classes. Call lines are full for 2 hours all day/chat is useless.
1248371647247077379 2020-04-09 18:06:08 EDT <nakedrobsf> @Xfinity What‚Äôs up with the internet outages in my neighborhood? Mission Street and Cortland in Bernal Heights, San Francisco. Two days in a row already. Are you all doing some rerouting or something? Thanks.
1248354896610496512 2020-04-09 16:59:35 EDT <WeHaveFossils> Not yet, as usual it takes way too long to show on the outages/map, even though it can't reach our cable modem.
1248331386488008714 2020-04-09 15:26:10 EDT <coreysmith_15> @Xfinity how do you have a 7 hour outage at the time when everyone is working from home. Come on.
1248330197759336450 2020-04-09 15:21:26 EDT <Carl_noWinslow> Welp Xfinity has an outage in my area lol
1248324159190577153 2020-04-09 14:57:26 EDT <EchoDoesRadio> Xfinity WOULD be having a widespread outage in my neighborhood when I‚Äôm swamped with work üò©üò©üò©
1248322467589840896 2020-04-09 14:50:43 EDT <UncleNeil> Xfinity outage extended to 330pm. Basically giving me a day off from work because I can't do anything remotely at this point. This is since 7am PST.
1248316731728297993 2020-04-09 14:27:56 EDT <bratttyc> not i paid my wifi bill just for xfinity to be having outages knowing damn well mfs is homeschooling.
1248308230792478720 2020-04-09 13:54:09 EDT <VelvetMcIntyre> .@xfinity claims there are no outages in my area, but the zoom meeting I've been kicked out of twice says otherwise.
1248301237927383043 2020-04-09 13:26:22 EDT <currypowderbarb> Me: I have finally gotten the motivation to get some school work done!  Xfinity: Nah dude not today   *Internet Outage in your area*
1248292396313587712 2020-04-09 12:51:14 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Andrew. Check your My Account app for info on area outages.
1248289466319503362 2020-04-09 12:39:35 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Vinny. Does your My Account app indicate that you're in an outage?

1248287968760127490 2020-04-09 12:33:38 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Alyssa. The site doesn't indicate that you're in an outage?
1248286969387417600 2020-04-09 12:29:40 EDT <SpenceB03> And then it tells me there is an area outage been like that all week

1248286469296467971 2020-04-09 12:27:40 EDT <Xfinity> Your internet? Did you check your My Account app to see if you're in an outage?
1248276849874153479 2020-04-09 11:49:27 EDT <xoEisha> How about im on the computer with unemployment, it took THREE HOURS for someone to respond. How about mid chat the fucking service goes out. I literally have been crying! I never have so many outage issues with other internet providers.
1248256730368221184 2020-04-09 10:29:30 EDT <NapoleonJ_PR> My internet is out. Thanks xfinity. This outage was needed smh
1248253486271041536 2020-04-09 10:16:37 EDT <Ripcity92> @Xfinity now is not the time for an unnecessary outage! Hurry up and fix my job depends on it.
1248192168176607237 2020-04-09 06:12:57 EDT <iAm_Cookies> @Xfinity is the outage.

1248097080502976517 2020-04-08 23:55:07 EDT <greenwombat> They have an outage. Switching to Xfinity Wireless. If you‚Äôre near one of their hotspots it‚Äôs free. Otherwise $20 for a week. Really need to see the last episode of Schitt‚Äôs Creek (and have a deadline tomorow), so forking over.
1248085525862457346 2020-04-08 23:09:12 EDT <rioters_anon> No outages in my area
1248083881917636608 2020-04-08 23:02:40 EDT <jrpeet> Have you viewed outage map. Verify there is no outage in your area
1248082743801626625 2020-04-08 22:58:09 EDT <jrpeet> Reboot everything. Use the Xfinity app on your phone to reset Xfinity. Reboot laptops. View Xfinity outage map. If you have been heavy gaming you perhaps have been throttled

1248061013288800256 2020-04-08 21:31:48 EDT <therealjz24> There‚Äôs most likely an outage issue that they haven‚Äôt fixed. That happens with our Xfinity when there‚Äôs an outage.
1248058389231357952 2020-04-08 21:21:22 EDT <rxyvun> @Xfinity I need some help or something. My modem has went offline 4 times today with no outages around my area.
1248054446564802565 2020-04-08 21:05:42 EDT <STFU1000> Okay so I have checked every cable, restarted my modem and my router, online in the outage map it only shows my residence but doesn‚Äôt give me any information on an eta of completion or anything, I really need help here please!
1248050131066179584 2020-04-08 20:48:33 EDT <kicksnkeyframes> @Xfinity there was a 3 hour outage last night. Called and they said it was scheduled maintenance. How come i wasnt advised of this before hand?
1248047449953968130 2020-04-08 20:37:54 EDT <ArtybeingArty> @Xfinity is there a outage in Detroit? 48207 area?
1248036091250331653 2020-04-08 19:52:46 EDT <STFU1000> @Xfinity having some issues connecting to the internet in the Alpharetta, Georgia area...any idea on an eta of the outage being done?
1248034071629967360 2020-04-08 19:44:44 EDT <RachelPerrone> ...and my wifi has been down for almost two hours. Xfinity insists there's no outage, everything is connected, have restarted 47 times. Might give crying a whirl now.
1248027820015706113 2020-04-08 19:19:54 EDT <catrose9> @Xfinity is there an outage with the xfinity stream app?? I can‚Äôt get it to log in with any of my devices or use my log in to log into channel apps!

1247991499738005511 2020-04-08 16:55:34 EDT <BreezyHaniChoi> Nope when I called they didn‚Äôt say anything about outages. The machine just says they will restart the modem and it should take about 10 mins

1247944576964472839 2020-04-08 13:49:07 EDT <erikasibal> Had an @Xfinity outage during crucial work hours so I had to go out to check if the clubhouse had internet (which turned out to be closed). Funny to see my fellow residents going out as well because of the same reason lol. Felt like that ending scene from Surrogates.

1247902184471056390 2020-04-08 11:00:40 EDT <mattisadev> Working from home is really hard with @Xfinity   Are you actually doing ‚Äúmaintenance‚Äù every day or is that just what the apps says when any outage is reported?  If so, why are you doing maintenance in the middle of the day when literally everyone is working from home?
1247900670637686794 2020-04-08 10:54:39 EDT <Ms_Tiitii> Really Xfinity? An outage now????? I should have just gone with Fios
1247897224081633287 2020-04-08 10:40:57 EDT <AlissiaMiller> @Xfinity People need distraction more then ever in this time. You have people that need to work, need to do school work, those who need to file for unemployment, those need to keep themselves busy for their mental health.   Get your service outages under control.
1247897043575533569 2020-04-08 10:40:14 EDT <AElmuchoo> During this pandemic freaking @Xfinity decides  to do an outage- work that‚Äôs effecting millions of people who have to work from home and or students who have to take online classes for now like wtf
1247891277309333505 2020-04-08 10:17:19 EDT <AElmuchoo> @Xfinity is doing some kinda of outage that was supposed to be done by now but nope , and what sucks about it is millions of people are being impacted it as we speak .

1247879339233943553 2020-04-08 09:29:53 EDT <jcuene> @comcastcares  and @Xfinity Your outage maps are wrong for the Minneapolis/Twin Cities zones. My service has been up/down throughout the day since last Thursday. Maps show no problem. Rebooted modem 30+ times since then?

1247878465514168323 2020-04-08 09:26:25 EDT <AElmuchoo> I felt bad for this one guy he‚Äôs a teacher @Xfinity told him that he‚Äôs outage was gonna be done by 6:30 than 930 than 12 than he got another email saying 2 , like u see wat there doing
1247878076505231361 2020-04-08 09:24:52 EDT <IraThomson4> @Xfinity something is wrong with my internet, it keeps going down, then comes back. It occurs at random times but seems to be every 5/10 minutes. There is nothing showing an outage, and I have restarted my modem and check the connections.
1247874728087310339 2020-04-08 09:11:34 EDT <AElmuchoo> I know right one of there reps told me that this outage was gonna be done by 930 Eastern  time  I‚Äôm in Cali , I checked still nothing then I was told 12 now than 2 it‚Äôs like wtf @Xfinity  get ur shit together and stop playing around .
1247873162399952896 2020-04-08 09:05:20 EDT <EaglesWonSB52> Since I've installed a door camera the most interesting thing I've learned, other than the 3am taxi drop offs for my neighbor, is how often my pricey @Xfinity service goes down.  Averaging one outage/day for the last 2 weeks. Hmmm
1247868631695921152 2020-04-08 08:47:20 EDT <Xfinity> Hey Mike. We know how important reliable service is to you, now more than ever. We are taking a number of steps to ensure you remain connected to your Xfinity services. Keep checking the My Account app for outage updates and alerts.

1247766264325353472 2020-04-08 02:00:34 EDT <KeeperOfWind> So I guess xfinity is just having an another outage again. So much for me playing FFXIV tonight
1247764715842834435 2020-04-08 01:54:25 EDT <hayhayhansonnn> Does anyone else in Houston area keep having major issues with their xfinity WiFi üôÉ We‚Äôve had two outages in like less than a week
1247762917237252097 2020-04-08 01:47:16 EDT <TheRealSkywere> @comcast @Xfinity I‚Äôm sorry but your services suck rn, I‚Äôm trying to get by due to epidemic, I was vibing on my game and now there is a country wide outage and in my area. Fix your stuff

1247756447913398278 2020-04-08 01:21:34 EDT <HTxRipper> @Xfinity @comcastcares could you please let us know AHEAD of time when you‚Äôll be doing maintenance.   Being surprised with an outage isn‚Äôt fun.  pic.twitter.com/teiXtHDrlE
1247725090550231047 2020-04-07 23:16:57 EDT <_ZiggyFresh_> @Xfinity this is ridiculous outage for a whole day and they keep extending the time.... just paid the bill how are we gonna fix this ? How many people work for home that‚Äôs a huge struggle right now! @Xfinity come on
1247719695446409217 2020-04-07 22:55:31 EDT <AElmuchoo> Same thing happen to another guy, his outage was supposedly be done by 7pm and @Xfinity  emailed him saying that he has to wait another 5 hours .
1247719149310099457 2020-04-07 22:53:21 EDT <AElmuchoo> Tbh their being supper slick rn one of there main reps told me that this whole outage was gonna be done by 930pm eastern time , I live in California , I checked my WiFi still not working .
1247717808160387072 2020-04-07 22:48:01 EDT <AElmuchoo> Wow their just being so slick rn , they told me that my outage was our all day and it‚Äôs gonna be fixed by 930pm  eastern time  7:47pm I live in California and it‚Äôs not fixed . This is not cool wat there doing
1247717713302208513 2020-04-07 22:47:38 EDT <HelloImGee> Also had an xfinity outage for the last 10 hours smh
1247717330441908228 2020-04-07 22:46:07 EDT <HelloImGee> Well I‚Äôd like to speak to someone regarding my utility because it‚Äôs unbelievable you guys have had an outage for over a day ongoing for probably more days and no compensation for down time. How much longer?
1247714911293247489 2020-04-07 22:36:30 EDT <jokesonyoukid> @Xfinity y‚Äôall lucky af that i can still play animal crossing offline. i know an intern probably runs this shit so there‚Äôs no point in bitching but fix your outages pls
1247705544569368582 2020-04-07 21:59:17 EDT <southern_speech> @Xfinity this is so unacceptable. Why do I pay you every month for NIGHTLY outages?! Why am I losing internet during online classes?! DO BETTER. IM ON MY SECOND OUTAGE OF THE NIGHT. BOTH OVER 45minutes TO AN HOUR. DO BETTER.
1247702865121964032 2020-04-07 21:48:38 EDT <strikerebel> oh, my bad. our ENTIRE TOWN is experiencing an outage right now and xfinity had no idea.
1247702312971165696 2020-04-07 21:46:27 EDT <strikerebel> my internet/tv has been out for hours now along with a bunch of other people in our neighborhood and my mom's colleagues well out of our neighborhood. xfinity literally told us that they knew nothing about an outage despite numerous people reporting it. fuck xfinity in the ear
1247699355055853568 2020-04-07 21:34:42 EDT <HelloImGee> How do you guys manage to have an 8 hour outage during a crisis like this? No tv no internet. @Xfinity you guys better reimburse customers with movies or something this is ridiculous
1247693768188444673 2020-04-07 21:12:30 EDT <HipH0pOtamus> Yo @Xfinity whats up with the 5 hour + outage during the COVID crisis?! Lame.
1247691513326338048 2020-04-07 21:03:32 EDT <JacobDamers> It always says no outages in my area, I‚Äôve been in contact with support to deal with it and They said they‚Äôd send someone out but that was Friday and it‚Äôs Tuesday, I know y‚Äôall going through a lot but 2 WEEKS I‚Äôm going crazy üòù now
1247687489202118656 2020-04-07 20:47:32 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked the My Account app to see if you are a part of an area-wide outage?
1247685409917804544 2020-04-07 20:39:17 EDT <Disneygurl1010> @comcast @Xfinity I seem to have lost internet, cable and phone.  I can‚Äôt even get into my xfinity account to check for an outage.  What‚Äôs going on?!
1247683709530234880 2020-04-07 20:32:31 EDT <theteck79> No internet. 3 hrs past ETA to fix area wide outage. Now you give no ETA and no lover person will answe the phone. We are sheltering in place with no TV, phone or internet. Thank the Lord I have ATT phone.
1247681425794568195 2020-04-07 20:23:27 EDT <scottfirestone> I get that the system is stressed but if we have no access to human customer support the outage info/map has to communicate what‚Äôs happening. Went hrs not knowing if it was a big outage + no way to get help
1247677005392424960 2020-04-07 20:05:53 EDT <scottfirestone> @Xfinity my internet has been out all day. First an outage showed up on the map now nothing. I‚Äôve reset/unplugged 40 times. Called support 2x and can‚Äôt get any help from a human
1247676009509294080 2020-04-07 20:01:56 EDT <AElmuchoo> I tried calling them rn their closed errr I‚Äôm telling u @Xfinity  is a joke when I spoke to them earlier this morning supposedly one of the main reps told me that it was a outage , and that it was gonna be fixed by 9pm eastern in which I live in California.
1247673526389108736 2020-04-07 19:52:04 EDT <FORRE5T> @Xfinity My internet / TV has been out for 8 hours. No estimated time for the outage to be fixed. Messaged @comcastcares and got no response. Messaged customer support online and they didn‚Äôt respond for over 10 mins before I ended the chat. Is this a joke?
1247669305153593344 2020-04-07 19:35:17 EDT <NickKosmider> Anybody else in Arvada having a Xfinity internet outage?
1247665895826173953 2020-04-07 19:21:44 EDT <OpperPoser19> Quarantine Day 14: @Xfinity outage in my area. It's about to get real #COVID19
1247663921521098753 2020-04-07 19:13:54 EDT <xoxoindi> This is the second time @xfinity has an outage in my area where I have to go endless hours without internet. Definitely need my bill adjusted and this time actually fix the problem. Thanks!
1247660795980156929 2020-04-07 19:01:28 EDT <AElmuchoo> How many people are being impacted by this outage ????
1247658152503304192 2020-04-07 18:50:58 EDT <AElmuchoo> Ya I‚Äôm sure do it‚Äôs just an outage problem but it‚Äôs annoying what there doing
1247655085422907392 2020-04-07 18:38:47 EDT <TFBlackout92> Quarantine Day 21: @Xfinity outage in my area... The real battle for survival begins.
1247652594065059844 2020-04-07 18:28:53 EDT <Mattyboi725> @Xfinity you all need to get this shit together I'm not paying 180$ a month for internet that's spotty at best. Lag and disconnects have been outrageous the last 2 months and its fucking ridiculous. Outages to. Get it together
1247650630300286976 2020-04-07 18:21:05 EDT <Xfinity> Are you seeing an estimated end time for this outage in your My Account app?
1247648544430964736 2020-04-07 18:12:47 EDT <sridharcitrix> Worked through @Xfinity outage the whole day using my @ATT hotspot and #CitrixWorkspace
1247648094721683457 2020-04-07 18:11:00 EDT <AElmuchoo> I guess it depends on the area , a lot of people are having an issue with @Xfinity and this whole outage problem
1247647250676776960 2020-04-07 18:07:39 EDT <AElmuchoo> I spoke to a coustmer service rep he told me it was an outage that y‚Äôall doing ???
1247641798153048064 2020-04-07 17:45:59 EDT <MasterPleb5000> Ending stream early, looks like we got another #xfinity outage :< I did happen to record a pretty sick #Warzone solo win so Ill upload that to YouTube 2pm cst tomorrow. Hopefully the internet will be better for tomorrows stream!

1247625504888205312 2020-04-07 16:41:14 EDT <chrishanis> @Xfinity @ComcastWA @ComcastWA internet outage. I have spent the last 30 minutes going through trying to get to an agent. The menu system walks you through a reset, but when that doesn't work, it walks you back through it again in an endless loop. how do i get a live person?
1247623890391773187 2020-04-07 16:34:49 EDT <SilentSnowNinja> @Xfinity  why me üò≠üò≠ love how there's no easy way to report an outage, if you want to talk to support, you have to sit and talk to a robot who tells you to do what you've already done, tells you what you already know, and then wait 3 hours to be called back and they can't fix it  pic.twitter.com/Jm6yhWVzA2
1247622902930948097 2020-04-07 16:30:54 EDT <Xfinity> How long has this issue been happening? Are you seeing any outages or maintenance in your area in your My Account app?
1247617644049715201 2020-04-07 16:10:00 EDT <YeahJu> I just want to know why y‚Äôall would decide to perform maintenance and cause an outage at 4pm on a Tuesday, when you know mfs are working from home üôÑ @Xfinity
1247615290998804481 2020-04-07 16:00:39 EDT <StarryEyeStacey> @Xfinity just found out that you all are experiencing an outage in my area and won‚Äôt be back up til 5:31p (aka 2.5 hrs from now) so much for getting paid to work today from home. Any chances it will get fixed sooner than 5pm?
1247613667409047552 2020-04-07 15:54:12 EDT <jiayi47118172> It says ‚ÄúThere are no service outages at your address. If you're experiencing issues, try tightening all connections to your equipment.‚Äù
1247613246946840577 2020-04-07 15:52:32 EDT <orange_minorca> Same here, no outage shown, but for the past couple days, around this time until around 9, I lose internet.

1247582663235514373 2020-04-07 13:51:00 EDT <CiceroCasti> @Xfinity ima need y'all to get it together with these outages.
1247578730878447617 2020-04-07 13:35:22 EDT <MosesBelman> @Xfinity the stream app is failing to load on my Samsung tv. Is there an outage going on?
1247578264287182848 2020-04-07 13:33:31 EDT <Bostongal23> It was resolved. Just a bit of panic as I had an important video conference that was to start quite soon after the outage became apparent. Thank you for acknowledging
1247573873740128261 2020-04-07 13:16:04 EDT <Atown_Downn> does anyone else‚Äôs internet in NW keep going out or is that just mine? I get poor service in my building so I can‚Äôt view @Xfinity‚Äôs outage map. @PoPville

1247565286116659203 2020-04-07 12:41:57 EDT <Bostongal23> @Xfinity internet outage is never good, but especially when you are #WFH. Please resolve ASAP!
1247563742650515456 2020-04-07 12:35:49 EDT <kenixfan> @comcast @Xfinity are you going to issue account credits for the weekly outages the last month? it's pretty common apparently fir those of us working from home in Southern Maryland!!!
1247562101549383681 2020-04-07 12:29:18 EDT <ranjuice> Shout out to xfinity for the WiFi outage I was hoping to do a 1600s reenactment at some point during this quarantine anyway
1247555520237461504 2020-04-07 12:03:09 EDT <adamk0310> It's a fantastic day for an @Xfinity outage!
1247553211298447361 2020-04-07 11:53:58 EDT <_bppr> This is my third @Xfinity outage since WFH began
1247544331272998912 2020-04-07 11:18:41 EDT <mrsnerfherder> I can‚Äôt leave my home for a hotspot...are you having an outage in certain areas? Please update your Twitter feed.
1247538761119854595 2020-04-07 10:56:33 EDT <HighCaliber> @Xfinity I'm concerned about internet outages in my zip code.  The internet goes out around 3 times a month due to "maintenance" via the statis center.    I have sceenshots of a lot of these issues.  Been happening since January.  What's going on?
1247537300893925382 2020-04-07 10:50:45 EDT <maannarkudi> @Xfinity  there has been sudden outage in Fremont CA 94538?please help! #xfinityoutage

1247529443691642885 2020-04-07 10:19:32 EDT <montanashotya> @xfinity so damn poor i pay too damn much for y‚Äôall to have an outage every other day damn
1247518583430635525 2020-04-07 09:36:22 EDT <theAltArp> Your outage map is kind of bogus. @Xfinity. It shows everywhere else in my area an outage, even my neighborhood. But magically, my location does not have an outage detected. Misleading. You took away live chat, I have to call to report..? Why not just predict based on neighbors?
1247513089194549253 2020-04-07 09:14:32 EDT <Xfinity> You can check for outages using this link:  https://xfin.tv/2UO7VUE¬† from your phone.
1247507958667370507 2020-04-07 08:54:09 EDT <CamiloJurado12> @Xfinity Status on network outage??  Since 1:30am and now maybe service @10:30am?

1247425642100072449 2020-04-07 03:27:03 EDT <scifivision> It‚Äôs likely XFinity. They always suck, though they are the fastest internet available around here. I may not get what they advertise, but it‚Äôs still faster than Verizon; we can‚Äôt get fiber optic here. Considering they had ‚Äúoutages‚Äù though, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs on my end. Thanks tho
1247418574580449280 2020-04-07 02:58:58 EDT <HOTBOY_NIC> Why tf is Xfinity having a outage RN I‚Äôm in tha middle of a good ass episode of OZARK
1247411176142778374 2020-04-07 02:29:34 EDT <Duchess_penny> The moment I get the motivation to do my work xfinity wants to play games and have an outage. I‚Äôm paying too much money just to have outages every other day.
1247410411999289347 2020-04-07 02:26:32 EDT <MrSUJag_26> Xfinity know they on this bullshit bruh. I swear. How you do an outage in the middle of the night?

1247389978788876294 2020-04-07 01:05:20 EDT <OfficialDJXage> And Mount Jewett Comcast server is based out of Pittsburgh so big yikes for the major outage at the worst time possible
1247385804458115073 2020-04-07 00:48:45 EDT <DillonODay> @Xfinity Please fix your WiFi outages in the West Michigan area...this  is not okay.
1247347279591141377 2020-04-06 22:15:40 EDT <RyManMD> @Xfinity is there a WiFi outage all over Portland right now? There seems to be quite a few of us without internet for the last 3-5 hours.
1247336383594856449 2020-04-06 21:32:22 EDT <BrianEinsweiler> @Xfinity I've had far beyond an acceptable number of outages. Two extended ones today alone - multiple others in the past week and a half. Paying way too much for internet service that I'm not able to depend on.
1247335899119136775 2020-04-06 21:30:27 EDT <tiff1980> @Xfinity you know millions of students are doing elearning, right? So how are they supposed to do that with your ridiculous daily outages and absolute lack of viable solutions. Checking the app doesn‚Äôt help. Restarting our routers doesn‚Äôt help. It‚Äôs YOUR issue! Fix it!
1247331418763649024 2020-04-06 21:12:39 EDT <SaveUsPedro> Xfinity stays having service outages in my area this shit is ridiculous
1247320944600850435 2020-04-06 20:31:01 EDT <Conrad_Abt> @Xfinity I‚Äôm really sick and tired of the daily internet outages. You can‚Äôt even talk to a person. There‚Äôs no way to get troubleshoot and get a credit
1247317720082808833 2020-04-06 20:18:13 EDT <MrKnix_oxo> No, no outages and nothing else reported, just no connection at all and my bill is paid.
1247308419217965058 2020-04-06 19:41:15 EDT <Xfinity> We can help. Have you been noticing any outages or maintenance in your My Account app during this time?

1247275095514587139 2020-04-06 17:28:50 EDT <TCidel05> Welp.. I had issues with my service here in Miami for a while now.

1246526954737672197 2020-04-04 15:56:00 EDT <NaeHeartless> @Xfinity WHAT is the reason for the CONTINUOUS outages in zip code 30309?  This is the second week/weeks of hours of no Internet & TV freezing.
1246520980538884096 2020-04-04 15:32:15 EDT <ThisIs__Me_> @Xfinity  has an outage faithfully each month. Fucking annoying.
1246486513799565312 2020-04-04 13:15:18 EDT <BradleyLevine5> @comcastcares #comcastoutage Internet has been dropping in and out for an hour at a time in Pottstown, PA for the last week.  Customer Service is none existent at this time.  @downdetector is doing better at receiving reports of outages then your own Xfinity status page.  pic.twitter.com/RnkmMZzjOs
1246476034914103296 2020-04-04 12:33:39 EDT <rdiehljr> @Xfinity @comcastcares @comcast would be awesome to talk to a live person. Then it says it‚Äôll have someone call me and then I get nothing and an error prevents a call? Have had about 1.5 hour outage and no response in 20879 zip code
1246281681251647488 2020-04-03 23:41:22 EDT <ydaak> @Xfinity really? A service outage right in the middle of a stream and  at the beginning of the weekend?

1246262981320638465 2020-04-03 22:27:03 EDT <CharlesColmer> I was on the line with an xfinity rep complaining about internet outage. The line dropped, she called back, the line dropped again and she didn't call back. They can't even keep their phones working, how can they keep the internet working.
1246257872285073411 2020-04-03 22:06:45 EDT <tiff1980> @Xfinity wtf. Outages for days.. up and down.. not the best time when millions are working and elearning from home. Yes I checked the app. Doesn‚Äôt show an outage even though I have horrible spotty service. For like 3 days now.  pic.twitter.com/ZItK85yXcM
1246249537724796928 2020-04-03 21:33:38 EDT <bertx86> Everyone seems to be reporting the same thing (including myself). We tell you there‚Äôs an outage, but your support says there isn‚Äôt because ‚Äúit‚Äôs not what the logs show‚Äù.  If your customers say there‚Äôs an outage, then there‚Äôs an outage regardless of logs.
1246245202790096897 2020-04-03 21:16:25 EDT <mooncusser2k> @Xfinity @comcast @comcastcares  Why can I not communicate with a human being? Tried website, phone, and here on Twitter. No response, only the useless chatbot and self-serve troubleshooting. Website says no outage, but there certainly is one.  #comcastoutage
1246233243734720513 2020-04-03 20:28:53 EDT <Pirates_31> To top that when I get home I find out that we have an internet outage with @Xfinity my day has not gone well.
1246232091953594368 2020-04-03 20:24:19 EDT <nunya60890693> @Xfinity @comcastcares  you guys are at it again.  So my outage two days ago because of some error in modem after a ‚Äúbrief interruption of services‚Äù the night before.  Supposedly only needed a reset then good to go.  NOPE.  I got 1 day of service then back to out.

1246179786382139392 2020-04-03 16:56:28 EDT <timswe> #comcastoutage Why does my neighbors #Xfinity WiFi work fine while mine has been out for 2 hours? An Outage in the area would affect us the same. What‚Äôs really going on? So frustrating!

1246144983653998593 2020-04-03 14:38:11 EDT <AmericaLatinx> Upgraded to @Xfinity @comcast 1K Mb per second & highest we‚Äôve gotten is 100 Mb. When I call customer service, I get an automated msg mentioning an outage which is not what we have and automatic hang up. This should be considered bad business practices. How can we work from home?
1246144797645115392 2020-04-03 14:37:26 EDT <OB787> @Xfinity Is there an internet and cable outage in Boston? My service is out.
1246142362247716864 2020-04-03 14:27:46 EDT <ymarathe> I was just thinking this morning how with everyone working from home we haven‚Äôt had an internet outage yet, and then 5 minutes ago @Xfinity right on cue.
1246142227367243777 2020-04-03 14:27:13 EDT <spicynachotra> I‚Äôm concerned as to why has @Xfinity been having so many outages in the Nashville area. especially being that so many people are working from home now. This isn‚Äôt a good look! This is outage number 3 within 7 days.
1246138068639404036 2020-04-03 14:10:42 EDT <LexiBelle26> @Xfinity please, please provide a legit update on the outage I‚Äôm experiencing right now. It was supposed to be resolved at 1:07 and now it got pushed back until 4:58. I‚Äôve lost an ENTIRE day.

We've reset the modem multiple times, and it shows there are massive outages in our area, but says ours is fine when we aren't getting a signal. Troubleshooting to try and get to a real person has led to dead ends.  pic.twitter.com/RMDO0tiujE

1246105112323469313 2020-04-03 11:59:44 EDT <__goddesskayla> It‚Äôs kinda hard to work from home and do online classes when @Xfinity has outages EVERYDAY. They‚Äôve had 2 today (one is currently happening) and it‚Äôs only noon. ü•¥ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1246103706690519040 2020-04-03 11:54:09 EDT <Camden213> I do not. I reboot my router by unplugging it after I log into my account and see that there is no outage in my area and that it can‚Äôt connect to my router. It happens daily for up to an hour and it‚Äôs getting really old.
1246102349187350529 2020-04-03 11:48:46 EDT <thegunnibunni> @Xfinity Any help? Already tried wires, resetting, your website says no outage even though there is, so I don't have an estimated time.
1246099447194488833 2020-04-03 11:37:14 EDT <jalle93> Yes there is an outage. Again. I have had an ‚Äúoutage‚Äù every month since I bought this service in July.
1246097397090078720 2020-04-03 11:29:05 EDT <CharlesLumpkin> States that there are no outages in area. But internet is unusable.

1246061567176835072 2020-04-03 09:06:42 EDT <joelfeder> App says "no service outages at your address." It's only cut out once so far this morning. Yesterday morning was worse. I'm not complaining. I'm sure the load on the network is brutal. Appreciate everything you guys are doing.
1246051723447111683 2020-04-03 08:27:36 EDT <dhkirk> .@Xfinity 15 hours and still showing an outage ... that‚Äôs close to a full week with seriously unusable service?  https://twitter.com/dhkirk/status/1245817603110481920¬†‚Ä¶

1245930129601118210 2020-04-03 00:24:25 EDT <DisneyMikeH> Hey @Xfinity Why are some of us in Elk Grove Ca going on the 10th day of an outage? Some of us have to work from home and can‚Äôt because of this outage which comes during a pandemic. Not good.

1245892347616993282 2020-04-02 21:54:17 EDT <Xfinity> Did you check the Xfinity My Account app yet? There could be an outage in the area.
1245887797422063618 2020-04-02 21:36:13 EDT <dhavalpatel82> Great now there is no way to talk to anyone at Xfinity regarding internet outages. Its either chatbot or restart modem #xfinityoutage #xfinity
1245884250945196032 2020-04-02 21:22:07 EDT <Xfinity> Did you check your My Account app to see if you're in an area outage?
1245878889282441219 2020-04-02 21:00:49 EDT <dbh1127> @Xfinity I have lost internet and cable in Mokena,IL are you experiencing outages in the area
1245871585401200640 2020-04-02 20:31:47 EDT <BanfieldKatrina> @Xfinity The only way I can seem to connect with an agent is through chat. I can't find a phone number and all the assistants lead me to chat. The assistant tells me I'm not priority because I don't have an outage and redirects me to the auto troubleshoot page.
1245871379028660226 2020-04-02 20:30:58 EDT <bdowney> Day 13/14 #comcastoutage  For the 14th day in a row,  @comcast/@xfinity has listed itself in outage for #mountainview.   Outage means that:  1. You can't speak to a rep on the phone ("they can't help with an outage") 2. You can't enroll new/replacement devices.  pic.twitter.com/UIFbsM2ZnA
1245865603509805056 2020-04-02 20:08:01 EDT <Xfinity> What issues are you having? Are you in an area outage?
1245863210927812609 2020-04-02 19:58:31 EDT <21EnerG> Okay. Maybe they‚Äôre late to report the outage. There some hope
1245860678218297344 2020-04-02 19:48:27 EDT <21EnerG> Haven‚Äôt had problems with @Xfinity since 3/11. Today. It started doing what is been doing.  So sick of it. It cuts out, comes back. Then cuts out. Not stable for more than 30 mins.   No outages in my area. Just a problem with my service.  AGAIN.
1245829539814653953 2020-04-02 17:44:43 EDT <Xfinity> Is there an outage in the area? Have you checked the Xfinity My Account app?
1245829030110203904 2020-04-02 17:42:41 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked the Xfinity My Account app? There may be an outage in your area.
1245827779268153346 2020-04-02 17:37:43 EDT <seanpalmer> My Internet is out because @Xfinity is doing "maintenance," which, can I say, is the WORST time in HISTORY for an   Internet outage. No school, work, meetings, etc....I may find a new ISP just for this foolishness.
1245826121687388160 2020-04-02 17:31:08 EDT <lazyxav> These internet outages are making online school dogshit my exam just crashed because of your shit Service @xfinity  pic.twitter.com/CBRN9pzxbs

1245816916452749319 2020-04-02 16:54:33 EDT <Tamzilla_52> Second Xfinity outage this week.  I‚Äôm going back to bed.

1245810904215826433 2020-04-02 16:30:40 EDT <Xfinity> Hi. We're experiencing longer than normal wait times right now. Have you checked your My Account app to see if you're in an area outage?
1245808823899693058 2020-04-02 16:22:24 EDT <ChaelBorden> No outage. My bill was paid in full at noon and still no tv service. On the phone OVER AN HOUR, transferred three times and just told to wait at least 4 hours. Ridiculous!
1245807549082935297 2020-04-02 16:17:20 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked the Xfinity My Account app? There may be an outage in the area.
1245789879641853952 2020-04-02 15:07:07 EDT <LeirielTV> Dear @Xfinity due to the Bay Area quarantine I've been working from home and even got your 1GB Internet package to make sure I deliver everything as soon as possible. However there's been outages every day multiple times and when it comes back I get this. ETA to fix?  pic.twitter.com/iQsPyJP8hd
1245788456179183617 2020-04-02 15:01:28 EDT <R3DH34DY> This is an everyday thing and it says there is no outages
1245786467063844864 2020-04-02 14:53:33 EDT <eazy707_> It says I am not in an outage area although my wifi hasn‚Äôt worked since yesterday. I‚Äôve done everything you guys have told me. Resets, reboots, tightening everything, etccc
1245780795274547201 2020-04-02 14:31:01 EDT <memyselfmissiza> It‚Äôs 230pm, it‚Äôs time for the usual @Xfinity internet outage. I‚Äôm sure there was no way to predict the amount of people that would be online nor prepare for the needed capacity/bandwidth for said people. But it sure sucks when you‚Äôre on a video call üòÜ #telework #workfromhomelife
1245775446018408448 2020-04-02 14:09:46 EDT <Jam365> Fortunately it‚Äôs not an outage. Whenever I jump into a game, I‚Äôll get lag spikes and packet loss constantly. I‚Äôve done modem restarts, test the lines through support and run speed tests. The speeds look fine, but don‚Äôt reflect what I‚Äôm experiencing in my games.
1245773669730856962 2020-04-02 14:02:42 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked your My Account app to see if you may be in an outage?
1245769924343037952 2020-04-02 13:47:49 EDT <echaike> @Xfinity 2nd outage in a week... can‚Äôt get a service rep on line & no resolution. #customerservice
1245767681254371328 2020-04-02 13:38:55 EDT <SF_Shoobie> 1.3) @Xfinity Your customer service is BEYOND infuriating. I have had an outage listed on my account for 3weeks...  Stop calling your customer service reps "agents" if you handcuff them from giving me any quantifiable or reliable data... I don't want to hear how they "get it".
1245766388687540224 2020-04-02 13:33:46 EDT <JohnPiraneo> @Xfinity it seems like our area has a service outage. However the app did say it was supposed to be resolved by 1:18pm today. Now it‚Äôs saying that service won‚Äôt be restored until 5pm . I am honestly so pissed off. Can‚Äôt do any work that I need to get done.
1245761450716651523 2020-04-02 13:14:09 EDT <Xfinity> We know your services during this time. Are you in an area outage?
1245755941707898880 2020-04-02 12:52:16 EDT <karipuf> @comcastcares  hi comcast/xfinity - I am unable to connect - the modem is flashing orange/red - I have tried tightening cables/restarting etc, and nothing works, and there are no reported outages. I just can't through to a human on the chat line. Can I please get some help?
1245748126813581312 2020-04-02 12:21:12 EDT <notcoolsteph> Yes, the website says ‚Äúthere are no reported outages at your address but there are service outages reported in you zip code‚Äù so what does that mean?
1245738152775446528 2020-04-02 11:41:34 EDT <joshabla> I now teach journalism students on Zoom. My @Xfinity internet continues to be unstable at my home in SF, making class next to impossible. Amazingly, we're not wired for fiber. The company has done nothing to address its outages in the 3 weeks I've been WFH. @comcastcares
1245736750007255040 2020-04-02 11:36:00 EDT <sadjadbp> @Xfinity my internet is very slow starting last night, outage page says "Outage map unavailable". Restarted modem. Can't find an agent to chat, it just says wait times are extended
1245734533275713536 2020-04-02 11:27:12 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Brandon. Does the Xfinity My Account app list the outage in your area?
1245731880118386690 2020-04-02 11:16:39 EDT <TheBrandonBrews> All this time I‚Äôve never experienced a internet outage. I guess were draining all of @Xfinity power today with all the folks working from üè°

1245720439135055874 2020-04-02 10:31:11 EDT <avillanueva3rd> If you can avoid it. Don‚Äôt get @Xfinity internet.  Always an outage never able to do anything for work.  I‚Äôd switch to @ATT if they would ever come out and put a box up closer to me.

1245438579188412419 2020-04-01 15:51:11 EDT <mattdav31> I have outage in my area this isn‚Äôt like you guys üò´
1245438366100992017 2020-04-01 15:50:20 EDT <Xfinity> Are you in an area outage or is there an issue with your connection?
1245436863004971009 2020-04-01 15:44:21 EDT <nunya60890693> @Xfinity @comcastcares I have all the time in the world to tweet for service.   I‚Äôm having CONTINUOUS internet outages.
1245429407189254144 2020-04-01 15:14:44 EDT <whatuphohm> yo @WatchMarquee @cubs @comcast @Xfinity @comcastcares how awesome would it be if y'all came together & stuck a deal in the midst of the sports outage in these troubled times so fans could have a bright spot to look towards? what fantastic PR you'd all get & it wouldn't take 6yrs  https://twitter.com/ramonashelburne/status/1245384226809102336¬†‚Ä¶
1245428102521434112 2020-04-01 15:09:33 EDT <AxCJ1> It‚Äôs been about an hour or so, today! There was an outage yesterday as well. Very very frustrating (some are 5/10 minutes) but these hour long outages are üò§
1245427758630658052 2020-04-01 15:08:11 EDT <Xfinity> Are you experiencing multiple area outages? For how long?
1245426513278832640 2020-04-01 15:03:14 EDT <AxCJ1> Why is @Xfinity having so many outages?????????????
1245425937539358720 2020-04-01 15:00:57 EDT <dinosaurdeal> Can't Stream Till Xfinity Fixes There Outage Bullshit I Will Be Live Once It Is Fixed ü§ôüèª
1245422923751600129 2020-04-01 14:48:58 EDT <RichErnst> #xfinity.  Yet another outage. Why is the Xfinity network so unreliable?
1245422253703139329 2020-04-01 14:46:18 EDT <Xfinity> We know your services are critical during this time. Are you seeing an estimated time of completion for the outage you're in currently?
1245420013571448833 2020-04-01 14:37:24 EDT <Xfinity> Hi. If you're in an outage, keep an eye on your My Account app for updates. We apologize for the interruption.
1245417157166538754 2020-04-01 14:26:03 EDT <enigmakelz> this is the worst april fools joke ever there‚Äôs an xfinity outage everywhere i can‚Äôt even play the sims
1245415103492771844 2020-04-01 14:17:54 EDT <Xfinity> Your app doesn't indicate that you're in an outage?
1245411214450016256 2020-04-01 14:02:26 EDT <ptr> We have had no internet for 24h. @comcastcares @Xfinity is there an outage in SF? I can't get through to a person at 1-800-XFINITY or by online chat, and a tech came out and said everything was fine on our end and we would just have to wait and hope things get better. (!!!!) üò¨üò°
1245410173553913858 2020-04-01 13:58:18 EDT <kelsiferofhell> outage since 10 am, was supposed to be resolved at noon.. now says 5pm.. #wack
1245410142444834818 2020-04-01 13:58:11 EDT <__irielove> How long is the outage in Colorado expected to last??
1245405073833783296 2020-04-01 13:38:02 EDT <jonathanwsabin> Our internet and phone have been down for over two hours, @Xfinity cannot connect to our modem but miraculously there are NO service outages at our address!  It‚Äôs remarkable how often this happens. They never acknowledge outages.  EVER!  pic.twitter.com/HVyCDmtlmt
1245403253669613571 2020-04-01 13:30:48 EDT <mega_r_ale> The only thing that makes the current situation more awesome, @Xfinity internet outagesüò° It would be great if this could be resolved. Signed, your friendly neighbor trying to work from home!
1245401218274545667 2020-04-01 13:22:43 EDT <okaypanda> Now is not the time for an Internet outage, @Xfinity.
1245400836760580097 2020-04-01 13:21:12 EDT <kddecourcey> @comcast @Xfinity What does a person have to do, to check for an outage for someone else, in a different area, who doesn‚Äôt have an account, because they work from home and the company holds the account? #ridiculous
1245395879487569923 2020-04-01 13:01:30 EDT <MelissaT0703> @comcast @Xfinity  My internet has been off since 7:30 am for an "outage". This labeled as 'maintenance' since 9:17. This is ridiculous!! Do your maintenance when ppl are sleeping. If it's not back on in an hour, you WILL be giving credit on my bill. JERKS.
1245395381309116417 2020-04-01 12:59:31 EDT <kddecourcey> @comcast @Xfinity I‚Äôm not checking for an outage in my area. I‚Äôm checking for someone else, in another area. Why can‚Äôt the outage may show all of the county? Why do I need to login to find an outage in another area? How do I check for outages in another area?  https://twitter.com/comcast/status/1245344666536509447¬†‚Ä¶
1245382489926963203 2020-04-01 12:08:18 EDT <adamantLOVE> @Xfinity fix these outage issues, no one has time for this while working from home!
1245379634147065856 2020-04-01 11:56:57 EDT <tommybutcher> @Xfinity 4 business days, 3 days with "maintenance" outages. Want a story @FOX26Houston @CNN? How about essential services (internet) down during business hours. Normally not an issue, but with #COVID19 we are all working from home. Do maintenance on off hours, not 9 - 5!
1245378090173415426 2020-04-01 11:50:49 EDT <justbreeee__> Xfinity better hurry up and fix this outage
1245369127440650241 2020-04-01 11:15:12 EDT <BBMolasses> @Xfinity @comcast i paid my bill. there are no outages in my area. why is my cable out?! the middle of a pandemic is not the time to cut off my access to local news
1245367414931537925 2020-04-01 11:08:24 EDT <bryancgrant> Hey @Xfinity @comcastcares, this is our second outage this week. My wife is working from home and this is costing us money. What kind of bill reimbursement can I expect?  pic.twitter.com/QaIfwD4GZc
1245360714568675329 2020-04-01 10:41:46 EDT <spiritualfleur> Way to go @Xfinity people working from home and can‚Äôt even rely on the internet cause y‚Äôall wanna have an outage my area üò°
1245357861124874240 2020-04-01 10:30:26 EDT <Warren_U_Out> Hey @comcast @Xfinity these internet outages in Detroit for two days straight is not helping at all! I hope you realize people jobs are on the line here. We can‚Äôt go into any offices!!
1245357802257817600 2020-04-01 10:30:12 EDT <jessica_polito> @Xfinity your internet has had "outages" for the last two days and  no one will answer your phones. Thanks for making the transition working from home easy for your customers....not. @comcastcares @comcast #xfinityoutage #comcastoutage
1245342667522871296 2020-04-01 09:30:03 EDT <kddecourcey> @comcast @Xfinity Who has time to wait 37 minutes, when access is needed to work from home? Your virtual chat is useless as well. Is there an outage in the Goodlettsville TN area. Asking for a friend.
1245342052654645248 2020-04-01 09:27:37 EDT <camoosomiller> Yes. Outage reported on app. Non helpful automated voice message tells me I‚Äôll be back online around 12:15.
1245330766378283015 2020-04-01 08:42:46 EDT <camoosomiller> If ever there were a time for @xfinity to assure internet reliability, it would be now. Alas, the last two weeks, intermittent outages in @AlexandriaVAGov . Time for a new vendor.
1245326282365206529 2020-04-01 08:24:57 EDT <matt__enloe> So, @Xfinity @comcastcares, can I bill you at my hourly rate for the hour you made me waste last night because your agent was poorly trained and uninformed? Seems only fair - you wanted to bill me if the outage was "user error." It should've been listed for both the agent and me.
1245325394057838593 2020-04-01 08:21:25 EDT <matt__enloe> This story has the dumbest fucking ending. I just got an automated phone call that @Xfinity @comcastcares "completed regularly scheduled maintenance that may have caused my outage" - or, exactly what I described last night to the support agent. Why didn't they have that info?
1245249563704819713 2020-04-01 03:20:06 EDT <victorcoon2> @Xfinity you guys gotta stop having these outages, I‚Äôm in the Chicago land illinois, and this is so frustrating. Please fix your outages.
1245242162314448896 2020-04-01 02:50:41 EDT <GARDNERWINSHEW> Internet outage in the area. Wonderful service @Xfinity !
1245224217567690755 2020-04-01 01:39:23 EDT <matt__enloe> This is the worst fucking time for an Xfinity outage
1245224041528659969 2020-04-01 01:38:41 EDT <FrescoPoveda8> Fuck Xfinity and their stupid ass outages! üò©
1245206431869145088 2020-04-01 00:28:42 EDT <_aaaalyak> This Outage Shit Is Happening Too Often @xfinity FIX IT
1245201515821834241 2020-04-01 00:09:10 EDT <__LizzieMcGuire> Twitter is saying there is a Comcast/Xfinity outage? Maybe that‚Äôs why resetting my router 7 times hasn‚Äôt done anything.  üôÉ
1245162595838914561 2020-03-31 21:34:31 EDT <g3rsonn> Checked outages site and shows I'm not affected. Did all TS, nothing. Contacted support which is this useless automated voice service. I bought my own modem and had ZERO issues. Ya'll force me to pay monthly for this crap Modem and I get this! BS #XFINITY #comcastoutage
1245159836645457921 2020-03-31 21:23:33 EDT <Xfinity> You can check the Xfinity My Account app for any outage info, Rebecca.
1245159833159925760 2020-03-31 21:23:32 EDT <thisisiyip> I live in San Mateo and need this outage to get fixed asap. Otherwise, I‚Äôll cancel my service as well as I refuse to pay this month‚Äôs bill unfortunately. @Xfinity
1245158719404617728 2020-03-31 21:19:07 EDT <realrebeccajo> @Xfinity Yo my internet isn't working what up. Outages??
1245155104635916288 2020-03-31 21:04:45 EDT <SuperDave1927> @Xfinity Any known outages in Fayette county, GA (30215) before I call tech support?
1245150972692832262 2020-03-31 20:48:20 EDT <zplot74> @realDonaldTrump I know you spoke to internet providers today. Can you knock @Xfinity / @comcastcares into gear? Never seen a worse provider with worse service. How can they just have random channel outages during a quarantine for no reason and with no resolution
1245145283828252672 2020-03-31 20:25:44 EDT <Xfinity> How are trying to connect? Are you using your mobile device? The app will tell you if there is an outage in the area and what the ETA is for restoration.
1245143559021477892 2020-03-31 20:18:52 EDT <dadoo70> Yes, it showed outages in the area, then it came back on, went back out.....repeatedly througout the day. Makes it hard to work from home successfully...my zip code is 30064 if that helps.
1245132931582001152 2020-03-31 19:36:38 EDT <DrizzyDC83> Come on @Xfinity y‚Äôall gotta do better.. another outage  pic.twitter.com/kPb2gcDiYG
1245131879315054600 2020-03-31 19:32:28 EDT <Leda1967> @Xfinity Get your shit together! For the amount of money you charge for internet,  cable and phone services, there should never be this many outages!!!   Not a happy customer!!
1245131060326924294 2020-03-31 19:29:12 EDT <Keepingitrealmn> This is not about outages. Comcast deleted a master file for our association and everyone lost their cable today. Each customer has to call to set it up again and Comcast is telling them they need new boxes. Not true. Comcast is trying to upsell. Then residents are told they 1.
1245130989292191747 2020-03-31 19:28:55 EDT <traceghodges> Hard to work from home with internet outages in my area. Internet has been unstable for 7 straight hours now

1245125475699240961 2020-03-31 19:07:01 EDT <powens33> Isolate that outage in your neighborhood so it doesn‚Äôt spread.
1245124582585049089 2020-03-31 19:03:28 EDT <Xfinity> Are you in an area outage?
1245122026832101378 2020-03-31 18:53:19 EDT <CodyNocton> There needs to be customer service for outages somewhere, no matter how many times I tweet or call, no person yet.
1245118360163155975 2020-03-31 18:38:44 EDT <CodyNocton> I‚Äôve followed these steps and am still not having any change. My modem is lit up and indicating it‚Äôs not receiving signal from Comcast. I‚Äôve been using the Internet all week without an issue until today and it‚Äôs out. Are there any outages?
1245101976389632004 2020-03-31 17:33:38 EDT <Yolandaathome> @Xfinity So I'm working from home..storm comes through at 11 am...internet goes down due to outage and it will be tomorrow before fixed??? Other areas around me have service and I just lost a day at work, with all that's going on.
1245097398730461185 2020-03-31 17:15:27 EDT <blockysplashy> Sorry guys my @Xfinity had an outage in my area! #Stream was #dope .#technician working on it! #Coronavirus #forgamers. @Xfinity hope u know there #will be more activity online since everyone is #quarantined! pic.twitter.com/1YUIUqX4XO

1245088603941806080 2020-03-31 16:40:30 EDT <CyssieB> I‚Äôm trying to be patient @comcastcares @Xfinity @comcast but this is the 2nd unplanned outage TODAY. I (and all affected) need a credit for the amt of time no service received. We shouldn‚Äôt have to pay full price when full service didn‚Äôt occur, especially at the price I pay.
1245086745143717896 2020-03-31 16:33:07 EDT <blackboltmagic> Second outage in less than a week. I work from hone due to COVID and I can‚Äôt keep telling my team I can‚Äôt work.
1245086045105991688 2020-03-31 16:30:20 EDT <Fam0us_Nobodie> I‚Äôm not watching that y‚Äôall have outages across the city fix them
1245079726743588874 2020-03-31 16:05:13 EDT <SunflwrBOMB> I seen. There‚Äôs been an outage since 1:40 pm. That is time missed from work!
1245079472493248512 2020-03-31 16:04:13 EDT <Xfinity> Technicians are working to get everything restored ASAP and we're sorry for the inconvenience. Be sure to check the Xfinity My Account app for updates on the outage.
1245078815883362307 2020-03-31 16:01:36 EDT <siddinpretty> These @Xfinity outages are insane!, is it too late to switch to @verizon ?
1245078342069637121 2020-03-31 15:59:43 EDT <SunflwrBOMB> There is an outage. I can not talk to anyone right now because of a wait.
1245077125566271491 2020-03-31 15:54:53 EDT <Xfinity> We know your service is important during these times. Are you seeing an estimated time of completion for this outage in your My Account app?
1245076077707436033 2020-03-31 15:50:43 EDT <_aaaalyak> YOU GOT TO BE FUCKING KIDDING ME WTF ANOTHER OUTAGE MOE @XFINITY Wtf is Going On
1245075936707477505 2020-03-31 15:50:10 EDT <CoachTwai> @Xfinity you don't send us an outage notification until we have to call, but you wanna text when our next payment is due??? Seriously get my services first before asking for payment during an outage üò°
1245075760605474817 2020-03-31 15:49:28 EDT <JenniferPieMar> Why has @Xfinity been having so many outages so annoying üòí
1245075757514346499 2020-03-31 15:49:27 EDT <mcandst> @Xfinity what‚Äôs up with the daily outages in Cypress, TX? Impossible to work and do online classes with outages yesterday and today. Please give some details as to what‚Äôs happening, since we can no longer speak to a live person.
1245075176833691648 2020-03-31 15:47:09 EDT <bdowney> Day 12: #comcastoutage   For the 11th day in a row, @comcast/@xfinity.  . has listed itself in outage for #mountainview.   Outage means that:  1. You can't speak to a rep on the phone ("they can't help with an outage") 2. You can't enroll new/replacement devices.  pic.twitter.com/OtS2oDArdz
1245073336792539136 2020-03-31 15:39:50 EDT <nyoungjinkrap> Hi @comcastcares! It‚Äôs been about 2 weeks now since my internet hasn‚Äôt been stable. On the xfinity app, it‚Äôs says we have an area outage. But for 2 weeks? That‚Äôs crazy. I pay so much for fast internet connection and I get this?
1245072326741217280 2020-03-31 15:35:49 EDT <AutonomousHoag> @comcast @xfinity our #internet in the #SF Bay Area has been suffering outages for more than a week, today it‚Äôs gone completely.

1245068902633287681 2020-03-31 15:22:13 EDT <Xfinity> We don't want to see you upset. Are you seeing any outage information in your My Account app?
1245065257204305921 2020-03-31 15:07:44 EDT <Xfinity> We can help. Are you in an area outage currently?
1245064045415333891 2020-03-31 15:02:55 EDT <houston_dining> @Xfinity been trying all morning to get help with an internet outage. Reset the modem multiple times. Still no connection.
1245063805190758400 2020-03-31 15:01:57 EDT <kolenik> @Xfinity how long is the outage in Chicago going to last?
1245062673076641792 2020-03-31 14:57:28 EDT <universalbell> Working from home is all zoom and emails until there is an internet outage in your area @Xfinity
1245062358789025793 2020-03-31 14:56:13 EDT <RealMelValentin> On day 2 of a cable outage in my hood, with zero updates from @Xfinity / @Comcast except they'll fix it "soon." I'm sure I'll continue to get fully billed too. Guess I should be grateful I still have Internet access.
1245061505965572098 2020-03-31 14:52:49 EDT <Surfnboy> Yes No outage area and I‚Äôve rebooted every day the past week with no success
1245061351149654017 2020-03-31 14:52:12 EDT <Xfinity> So you've checked and you're not in an area outage? Have you rebooted your gateway?
1245060433872146432 2020-03-31 14:48:34 EDT <TommyBrooks_> Makes it hard to do online college when there‚Äôs another WiFi outage every day @comcast @Xfinity
1245051592333824001 2020-03-31 14:13:26 EDT <TomDorans> @xfinity outages are unacceptable. Especially now with working out of the house and two college students taking on line classes.  Get your act together.
1245047291087650822 2020-03-31 13:56:20 EDT <mterril709> @Xfinity outage in my neighbord in Chicago went from ‚Äúshould be back in an hour‚Äù to ‚Äúas soon as we can.‚Äù üò´ Making it really hard to be working from home over here!
1245044616165982209 2020-03-31 13:45:42 EDT <ImIllMinded> Bruh xfinity has an outage during the quarantine lol
1245043564721176577 2020-03-31 13:41:32 EDT <SaltyCSC13> I'm not sure where that would show up. I checked the Outage Map, but I didn't see any type of history associated with it. These would be temporary drops. I have to restart my XBOX to reconnect, but it will sometimes drop again within 30 minutes.
1245035141661163521 2020-03-31 13:08:04 EDT <BlaQNall4> So Xfinity has an outage in south Philly?!
1245031719771738112 2020-03-31 12:54:28 EDT <Michael89757021> @Xfinity sent out an email that they would ensure reliable internet to support its customers needs in this time. I have enough outages to prove that's false advertising. Any lawyers reading this want some money.
1245030374876549121 2020-03-31 12:49:07 EDT <Xfinity> We know any down time is frustrating. Are you seeing any area outage information in your My Account app?
1245030341494145024 2020-03-31 12:48:59 EDT <fecthisathing> You know what would make working through a #pandemic more fun?? Wide spread power outages!! And Xfinity wifi playing games ü§™üò£
1245026056370884608 2020-03-31 12:31:57 EDT <d0x360> I did ty, I'm just trying to report intermittent outages in my area.  Info is in the DM.  it happening to my friends and family who live in the same town as well.  I did phone support but they said there is no issue. I'd just like it to be acknowledged honestly
1245025036198711296 2020-03-31 12:27:54 EDT <Michael89757021> And you can't screenshots your outages to post otherwise I'd have 30 screenshots of their shit. For security purposes. It's to defend the company against their failure
1245024257253543938 2020-03-31 12:24:49 EDT <d0x360> I'm having constant issues too and it never says there is an outage in my area.  I find Comcast generally doesn't like saying where and when there is an issue because of bill credits
1245020591721197568 2020-03-31 12:10:15 EDT <Michael89757021> It is. It has been every single day making it impossible for me to work while stuck at home. Your company is costing me money and possibly my job soon. I know other people aren't haven't any outages but this is every day. I'm giving you guys til the end of the weak before I leave
1245020295330701313 2020-03-31 12:09:04 EDT <Xfinity> Are you seeing an end time for this outage in your My Account app?
1245017260965515264 2020-03-31 11:57:00 EDT <JayRaitt> Is an Xfinity outage during online school the same as a snow day?

1244990448738992128 2020-03-31 10:10:28 EDT <Gabberty> It says no internet access so I can‚Äôt see outage spots
1244988439394750467 2020-03-31 10:02:29 EDT <UnionFF_Scott> @Xfinity outage in the chicago area?
1244985212024565762 2020-03-31 09:49:39 EDT <andrewmh> It has, 5-10m or so after the outage started occurring.
1244983720379142149 2020-03-31 09:43:44 EDT <andrewmh> There appears to be an @Xfinity outage in Petworth, #DC. Internet keeps going in and out...
1244963564651253762 2020-03-31 08:23:38 EDT <nailoredit> .@Xfinity Can you help me? There‚Äôs been nearly daily outages in my area? This only started when we moved.  Previously, I had to restart my router maybe once in a 6 month period. Now, it‚Äôs been multiple times a day, and lately that hasn‚Äôt even resolved the connection issue.
1244947619467706368 2020-03-31 07:20:17 EDT <saltylib> @Xfinity two day‚Äôs in a row with outages in my area. I better be getting a prorated bill. Can‚Äôt even use the online chat anymore. Have to call and the wait is absurd.
1244876013999439872 2020-03-31 02:35:45 EDT <_lesbehonest10_> Xfinity would have a maintenance outage at a time like this üôÉ tf I‚Äôm suppose to do now.
1244864964797571072 2020-03-31 01:51:50 EDT <Simplyy_Valerie> Xfinity got some F****IN nerve having an outage while I‚Äôm watching my shows. ü§¨
1244821673880272897 2020-03-30 22:59:49 EDT <jdigiovanni81> @Xfinity so ive had problems@the whole week now i have no tv and no internet rep tells me your techs are afraid to go out and check on outage and perhaps when the pandemic passes then ill have services again?! You cant do that to people!!!
1244807251552059392 2020-03-30 22:02:30 EDT <esstony_> Here goes @xfinity again with an internet and tv outage since 3pm
1244802502928805889 2020-03-30 21:43:38 EDT <Xfinity> Check the Xfinity My Account app to get updated on services and outages in your area.
1244778046961442816 2020-03-30 20:06:27 EDT <BBFeedsFan> It's happening all over. On the internet outages map yesterday all but the interior of the Country was affected and almost that much again today
1244767057939271682 2020-03-30 19:22:47 EDT <aloke_mahato> Wow, what a reply I got for the DM. Since there is an ongoing maintenance we can not check now. It is so convenient for @comcast to just update the outage page everyday so that customer care can say this line. #comcastoutage #xfinity #comcast pic.twitter.com/3jYt5W0bzV
1244766929136607244 2020-03-30 19:22:17 EDT <ThiagoAlvesATT> @Xfinity get it together with all damn outages! #almosteverydamnday
1244763714068283393 2020-03-30 19:09:30 EDT <MyLifeAsVanity> Yes I have. No outages...just mine
1244751533255921665 2020-03-30 18:21:06 EDT <FiggaDaKID> Man @Xfinity y‚Äôall trash.. I‚Äôm tired of these outages, niggas quarantined with no WiFi.. I‚Äôm bouta go see what google WiFi and AT&T hitting for, fuck y‚Äôall üò§ shit got me hot
1244746546547171331 2020-03-30 18:01:17 EDT <cpiper> I really need more info about the outage in 37914 zip code @Xfinity @comcastcares. Service was supposed to be restored yesterday. Zero info on the app or via phone. Help! Trying to work from home but can‚Äôt.
1244741712854974464 2020-03-30 17:42:05 EDT <bdowney> Day 11: #comcastoutage   For the 11th day in a row, @comcast/@xfinity has listed itself in outage for #mountainview.   Outage means that:  1. You can't speak to a rep on the phone ("they can't help with an outage") 2. You can't enroll new/replacement devices.  pic.twitter.com/c8bLrtTlKp
1244739742966538240 2020-03-30 17:34:15 EDT <allie_huston> @Xfinity @comcast we are having a service outage and we have gotten disconnected from chat support several times and cannot access any help on the phone, not getting the service we are paying for!
1244726356048580610 2020-03-30 16:41:03 EDT <__goddesskayla> It‚Äôs funny how u can pay $220 a month for internet and cable and it‚Äôs always an outage and never a credit. Kinda glad my contract with @Xfinity is up next month.
1244716649615437824 2020-03-30 16:02:29 EDT <_tashalanae> Xfinity has an outage so no tv/internet/hotspot...can‚Äôt work from home, can‚Äôt do my homework, can‚Äôt record music...I‚Äôm DONE DONE

1244713164513689602 2020-03-30 15:48:38 EDT <Xfinity> Hi, we are working hard to keep everyone connected. Have you been seeing area wide outages?
1244710311673856000 2020-03-30 15:37:18 EDT <IamCodySilfies> If losing your internet repeatedly throughout the day (though understandable) wasn't frustrating enough - @Xfinity's bold-faced lie of a  'Nope, service in your area is totes fine" page always pushed e me over the edge. Does this page ever report actual outages?
1244707612383379456 2020-03-30 15:26:34 EDT <74inchesoflady> There was an outage in my area earlier but it was supposedly ‚Äúresolved‚Äù. It wasn‚Äôt resolved for me. I‚Äôve tried manually restarting my modem five times. I can‚Äôt get a service appointment until Wednesday. Not sure how I‚Äôm supposed to work at all.
1244707487976165376 2020-03-30 15:26:05 EDT <SnuggleFunz> There has been an outage in my Zip code for a whole week but I can't get a hold of anyone. Can you help at all?
1244704220730851328 2020-03-30 15:13:06 EDT <SnuggleFunz> @Xfinity hey, I was wondering if there was an outage in Cummimg GA? All my equipment is hooked up correctly but I still get no connection.
1244699443569610753 2020-03-30 14:54:07 EDT <Casieg> It says there are no outages but it looks like there are some service issues being reported nearby.
1244698214420189184 2020-03-30 14:49:14 EDT <laurusnobilis6> @comcastcares @Xfinity terrible WiFi in Mtn View, CA. Yes, I have reset my modem. Yes, I have checked the outage map. Yes, there is ALWAYS an outage on weekdays. Can‚Äôt telework with this unreliable ISP. Is @ATT better?
1244696850931671041 2020-03-30 14:43:49 EDT <mikey_sf> Anyone else in Santa Fe enjoying the 2-3 times daily @Xfinity internet outages? @comcastcares @comcast
1244689636057681922 2020-03-30 14:15:09 EDT <TBpnw> Seems like a terrible time to have a company wide outage.
1244688234053095424 2020-03-30 14:09:34 EDT <Tracy734G> @Xfinity, we are working from home, kids are schooling from home. Get your act together, outages practically every day. #vschool #needinternet #WFH
1244676245180252162 2020-03-30 13:21:56 EDT <DakotaSchuch> @Xfinity @comcast @comcastcares Hey, do you think you guys can get your shit together? This is two days in a row where I've been without internet for over 5+ hours/day because of these "service outages"...yet I'm still paying you ungodly amounts of money for subpar service...
1244667622425268225 2020-03-30 12:47:40 EDT <DrCiv> @Xfinity now we have had double-digit occurrences of outages this month. Maybe you could actually fix the issue instead of having hours of outages on a regular basis?!?!?  @comcastcares @comcast @FCC
1244664351069548544 2020-03-30 12:34:40 EDT <left4donut> Already did that. There aren‚Äôt any reported outages in the area.   I finally got ahold of someone and they‚Äôre sending out a technician.
1244658175141347329 2020-03-30 12:10:08 EDT <ptocnl> @Xfinity If you're going to have an outage every other day, I would like to only pay for my cable bill every other month
1244658169676214273 2020-03-30 12:10:06 EDT <bywnder> @Xfinity I have experienced daily outages since early February. I call "customer service"  every time and your agents have no information and not a single supervisor has been able to get me any informarion on when this will be resolved. You provide the worst customer service.
1244651218179416068 2020-03-30 11:42:29 EDT <GlitRNStudz> Yes, an outage and 3:26 is the estimated time. That‚Äôs half a day of work.
1244648164461772800 2020-03-30 11:30:21 EDT <GlitRNStudz> @Xfinity now is NOT the time for an outage, we are working from home here.
1244644968989446144 2020-03-30 11:17:39 EDT <ayeschepp> As always, here is our bimonthly internet outage, thanks @Xfinity!
1244624867351289857 2020-03-30 09:57:47 EDT <KatelynnKarugu> No outages in the area. There appears to be an issue moving the account to the new address. Everyone we talk to is saying something different, so we don‚Äôt have a clear idea of what the issue is.
1244462250221420544 2020-03-29 23:11:36 EDT <bdowney> @Comcast/@Xfinity used @comcastcares to DM me that there was a maintenance scheduled by 5:35pm that would fix the outage in my area.  Unsurprising twist: it was not fixed.   How do I know this? #comcastoutage has resulted in a new time for a fix since ... Tuesday. pic.twitter.com/275OHe81oq
1244435993475891208 2020-03-29 21:27:16 EDT <hroth3_roth> Ok. I am going to rant. We expect remote working & learning. However, xfinity has been down twice for over six plus hours each time in the last 2 days. WTH!!! I never had an outage before. Let me guess‚ÄîI need to upgrade!?!
1244432947190493185 2020-03-29 21:15:09 EDT <BuddyChin> @Xfinity WiFi down in seattle 98102. Same as yesterday... and day before. None of the features on the app work (schedule a call, outage map...etc). Please let me know if there is an issue. I would like to let my employer know as I‚Äôm WFH
1244427730973855744 2020-03-29 20:54:26 EDT <villageorganics> @Xfinity we are experiencing an outage
1244388052341940225 2020-03-29 18:16:45 EDT <MaggieSloan> @comcast @comcastcares @Xfinity my Internet is down. Are you having widespread outages?

1244367061251280896 2020-03-29 16:53:21 EDT <bdowney> It's not just Oakland. They have listed themselves as having an outage in #mountainview for 10 days.
1244365149093253121 2020-03-29 16:45:45 EDT <bdowney> Day 10:  #comcastoutage  For the 10th day in a row, @comcast/@xfinity has been listed in an outage in #mountainview.  Outage means that:  1.

1244359593448411138 2020-03-29 16:23:40 EDT <SeanMLocke> Also hey, @ComcastCares, @Xfinity, or whoever? You sent some guys out here to bury a cable and they've disconnected our internet service. They didn't bother to knock and say they were done. Now we have a service outage and I can't get any help.
1244332802809696264 2020-03-29 14:37:13 EDT <davis_alexp> @Xfinity the week before courses resume is...not a good time for a WiFi outage üôÉ
1244317382404964352 2020-03-29 13:35:56 EDT <GarenJArargil> Hey @comcast @Xfinity I‚Äôve been complaining about my intermittent and inconsistent service for WEEKS with no solution. I‚Äôm paying an exorbitant amount of money for 1/3 of my day being lost to outages. This is absolutely insane.
1244287286084329473 2020-03-29 11:36:21 EDT <IsraeliteZay1k> damn xfinity got a internet outage smh
1244285222197346309 2020-03-29 11:28:09 EDT <PumaPamf> Good old @Xfinity. Severe thunderstorm last night, and a network outage happens 5 hours afterwards. @ATT please, please, please get gigabit fiber to the door of my new house.
1244276882507542529 2020-03-29 10:55:00 EDT <CandaceYvette28> @comcast @comcastcares @Xfinity Please advise if my area is experiencing an outage. I can't speak to customer service via phone or chat. My services have been down for several hours. I've DM'd and no response.
1244270791937662978 2020-03-29 10:30:48 EDT <d_christophor> @Xfinity now is NOT the time to have an outage!!!!!!!
1244263586421256193 2020-03-29 10:02:10 EDT <hopefrederick73> @Xfinity soooo when are y‚Äôall going to acknowledge the internet outage in Charleston for over 24 hours??
1244151630196551682 2020-03-29 02:37:18 EDT <TFroehlig> @Xfinity been trying to report an outage over the phone for an hour and it won't let me over the phone.
1244140226127282177 2020-03-29 01:51:59 EDT <MattWilliamsInc> Update. It‚Äôs day 11. No outages...  Until 12:15 am.  I think @Xfinity did it so I can‚Äôt say ‚Äúliterally‚Äù anymore. #conspiracy
1244101584914722817 2020-03-28 23:18:26 EDT <IndicaJones20> @Xfinity   60482  Outage since 10:00pm CST
1244099212737826816 2020-03-28 23:09:01 EDT <DanielleThys> I prefer working internet and TV. Neither happen with @Xfinity Outage is 24 hrs in Oakland. Zero communication as to what is going on. These are lifelines, people. COMMUNICATE.
1244092766273093634 2020-03-28 22:43:24 EDT <TheRealBBJay_> Lawd Xfinity please get together with this outage üò©ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1244089186317025280 2020-03-28 22:29:10 EDT <DanielleThys> @comcast @Xfinity outages for 24 hrs+ should really be addressed with more than your standard outgoing message. WTF is going on in Oakland? #Communicate #ComcastOutage
1244088298965999616 2020-03-28 22:25:39 EDT <NSFWJonathan> @Xfinity these internet outages just the norm now?
1244084154804965376 2020-03-28 22:09:11 EDT <stevehebert> We just had a lighting strike close that sounded close. Home internet is down, which doesn't feel good right now.  When I contacted Xfinity w/ chat, they already had the outage reported and asked if I wanted to receive sms messages about the it. Nice customer experience so far
1244074565736824832 2020-03-28 21:31:04 EDT <riippa> @Xfinity how do I check if I have a local internet outage?
1244056727085109249 2020-03-28 20:20:11 EDT <JarlUbba> Hey @xfinity, have you guys just given up? Sounds like major outages all over the country. Haven‚Äôt had service in the Twin Cities for most of the afternoon.
1244050855701045248 2020-03-28 19:56:52 EDT <BuddyChin> @Xfinity I‚Äôm in Seattle 98102 and connectivity has been bad (understandable) but today it works for 30 seconds then continually goes down.

1243938927708385280 2020-03-28 12:32:06 EDT <xo_jayylove> @Xfinity @comcastcares @comcast  Can you stop with these outages. I feel like I‚Äôm in Black Plague times with no internet. You are only available on your app right now... It‚Äôs been a week and every time I try to contact you all, I get disconnected because I have no connection.

1243827587044032512 2020-03-28 05:09:40 EDT <MlleRachelM> Over 6 hours of service outages and I'd really like to know how @comcastcares @Xfinity or whatever you're calling yourselves these days charge an arm and a leg monthly but can't be reliable for basic service. This is not okay!! #WorkFromHome #UtilityServicesDuringCovid19
1243810482563108865 2020-03-28 04:01:42 EDT <ExLegeLibertas> Cuz there's XFinity outages, cuz there's personnel shortages, because XFinity Personnel are not Necessary Personnel, and they have to invade the homes of Gross Fucking Randos as part of their job.   I'd call off too. Not Today, Satan. 1/2
1243785615092510720 2020-03-28 02:22:53 EDT <heelwalkerquinn> I'm not mad, I was just wondering what the problem was because it seems like WiFi has been spotty every few days and it's not just home, it's work too. On nextdoor people have been asking about Xfinity outages.
1243781681875546112 2020-03-28 02:07:15 EDT <aloke_mahato> @comcast @xfinity so many outages and latency issues in the past week in Millbrae, map shows outage throughout the day. Why we are paying when we have to use mobile hotspot to work. Can we expect to get this fixed @comcastcares #comcastoutage #xfinityoutage #xfinity #comcast pic.twitter.com/KH5MfOmo93
1243777427672727552 2020-03-28 01:50:21 EDT <MInteriorsMarin> @Xfinity day 11 without internet. Confirmed that there is no outage in my area as you have said for 11 days. Service tech came and went, no follow up. #shameful
1243736573402705920 2020-03-27 23:08:01 EDT <joonsterster> @comcast @Xfinity #comcastoutage #xfinityoutage Internet outage in Millbrae, CA since noon today PDT.  When will this get fixed?   We are living in the dark due to Xfinity.
1243725178456203265 2020-03-27 22:22:44 EDT <Becka48122078> @Xfinity I NEED HELP!!! My internet is not working I can‚Äôt get anyone on chat and no one on the phone! I have rebooted and there are no outages in my area! I need to work!!! This is really bad
1243721548554539010 2020-03-27 22:08:19 EDT <kookid_deee> @Xfinity how y'all gone have a WiFi outage in the middle of a quarantine? üòí
1243715033919520777 2020-03-27 21:42:25 EDT <KevinCooney> I‚Äôve been in touch via the app... service outage time has gone from 9:30 to 12:30
1243714990445481985 2020-03-27 21:42:15 EDT <VelvetMcIntyre> The outage map is unavailable is how bad the service is. @Xfinity does not care.
1243713763951476736 2020-03-27 21:37:23 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Matthew. Have you checked your My Account app to see if you're in an outage?
1243712690037633024 2020-03-27 21:33:07 EDT <KevinCooney> My wife and I are working from home and we‚Äôve had cable/internet outages on and off on our block since 3:30 this afternoon
1243712375552987136 2020-03-27 21:31:52 EDT <arrdem> lol @Xfinity has a regional outage. fuckin clowns.
1243703363654598656 2020-03-27 20:56:03 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked the Xfinity My Account app? There could be an outage in the area.
1243696032204173315 2020-03-27 20:26:55 EDT <Mirtastic> Funny; My app NEVER shows any ETAs on current outages or repair estimates. Just gotta sit and wait for more than 12 hours at a time.
1243687621307531269 2020-03-27 19:53:30 EDT <mehul_khedekar> There was a xfinity internet outage last night
1243686389893361664 2020-03-27 19:48:36 EDT <Luna__Stylez> Is there an outage in your area?
1243686248528543744 2020-03-27 19:48:02 EDT <JoeJSchembri> Not an outage.  Other TVs in the house working.
1243686080114802688 2020-03-27 19:47:22 EDT <Xfinity> You can keep an eye on your My Account app for updates on outage resolution times.
1243683428928647168 2020-03-27 19:36:50 EDT <JoeJSchembri> Yes rep now says there ‚Äúare some outages‚Äù and said 4hr wait for tech support.  Fed up and ready to cancel.
1243680347256020992 2020-03-27 19:24:35 EDT <bdowney> Xfinity has been in an outage state apparently for big chunks of the bay all week (literally 8 straight days of 'having an outage' in Mountain View).   I haven't had upstream of > 1 Mbps during the day all week.  Friends are having the best luck with Fiber -- AT&T, Sonic, etc.
1243680164657192960 2020-03-27 19:23:52 EDT <Xfinity> Are you in an area outage?
1243674850075574274 2020-03-27 19:02:45 EDT <CarolynSmithPR> Just sent a dm. Experiencing yet another internet outage.
1243667315268431877 2020-03-27 18:32:48 EDT <damianpenthouse> @Xfinity is there an outage in my area cause wtf is going on
1243665592726491143 2020-03-27 18:25:58 EDT <MADI_velli> getting sick of xfinity outages
1243655683356135425 2020-03-27 17:46:35 EDT <TNMelREALTOR> @Xfinity you going to pay me for my missed work? Almost two hours down and I still haven‚Äôt spoken to a person and no answer if it‚Äôs an area outage or just us
1243654556451471360 2020-03-27 17:42:06 EDT <TNMelREALTOR> #xfinity @Xfinity can you at least tell me if the outage is my area or just me. Can‚Äôt get a person, only automation doing the same thing over and over. I can‚Äôt go somewhere else to work!!!
1243645062451548161 2020-03-27 17:04:23 EDT <pennvideo> ! This looks to be a widespread outage, likely originating from our headend in Sansom Place West.   Residents, please use XFINITY on Campus for the duration.
1243643365930999808 2020-03-27 16:57:38 EDT <chazthecancer> Xfinity so childish for having a outage, now I can‚Äôt use my WiFi üò§
1243642279455145984 2020-03-27 16:53:19 EDT <BeeFzX3> @comcastcares @Xfinity internet has been down since last night. Your chat bot says: There is an outage in your area that we are working to resolve by 2020-03-31 8:00:05 AM  Are you SERIOUS??? 4 days to fix this???
1243641418637119488 2020-03-27 16:49:54 EDT <jdartute> Hey @Xfinity , an internet service outage midday when many of your customers are working from home is... suboptimal. "A service tech is working in your area" doesn't appease my boss.
1243636604817887237 2020-03-27 16:30:46 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked your My Account app to see if you're in an outage?
1243613534388281344 2020-03-27 14:59:06 EDT <marcodemiroz> @comcast @Xfinity  network failures continue in #TheBayArea   Upload speed is near zero...    daily outages, and they further deprecated customer service that no longer provides time estimates or text updates. Pls spend less $ on commercials - more $ on network infrastructure ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1243612393042829312 2020-03-27 14:54:34 EDT <TiffanyRoslyn_> Y‚Äôall xfinity conveniently had an outage as I‚Äôm in the middle of a work call.. now I can‚Äôt even finish my work for the day, smh
1243605921164656640 2020-03-27 14:28:51 EDT <eesin_bah> @Xfinity I have lost hours of potentially billed work and law school class time because of frequent Internet outages. What is going on with DC? Should I expect more outages?
1243605111533907971 2020-03-27 14:25:38 EDT <CarolynSmithPR> Every single day I‚Äôve had to deal w/ an internet outage. @Xfinity I don‚Äôt understand why my internet goes out daily??? This isn‚Äôt the time for spotty coverage.
1243604363441885184 2020-03-27 14:22:39 EDT <bdowney> Frustrating for me, but really bad for my SO, who is a teacher (we also have to work to not overlap calls).   What I'm looking for from @comcast/@xfinity  1. An explanation 2. An actual timeline for a fix for this 3. Removal of outage state so we can get support/register devices.
1243604360233275393 2020-03-27 14:22:39 EDT <bdowney> Day 8: #comcastoutage   People living in this part of #mountainview are now on day 7 of a #comcast/#xfinity outage.   During this outage:   1. You cannot speak with a Comcast service rep 2. Apparently upstream bandwidth is having huge issues, but today my downstream is down.  pic.twitter.com/RKWjGu37Yb
1243589026424250371 2020-03-27 13:21:43 EDT <Bri_Desiree> Why is there another internet outage @Xfinity I pay way too much for this to continuously happen! You are hindering my work flow.
1243584504737878024 2020-03-27 13:03:45 EDT <njswagger251> I‚Äôm literally having the same issue right now, I would usually pull 200 mbps but right now I‚Äôm only getting 8 mbps. But it doesn‚Äôt say there is an outage in my area so I‚Äôm confused?
1243575768753545218 2020-03-27 12:29:02 EDT <RadicalYue> So I've got an internet outage in my area, call @Xfinity and it says it won't be back on until March 30th at 10am????? NANI THE FRICK?
1243568374006849539 2020-03-27 11:59:39 EDT <umlizzyiguess> @Xfinity WiFi outage while millions of Americans are working from home? Nice.
1243567632307060747 2020-03-27 11:56:42 EDT <desiInCali> Hey guys @Xfinity  2nd day, there is still outage in rush hospital area, Chicago. Any idea when is this going be resolved !!! Tx  pic.twitter.com/dPpAsgX1cd
1243560873509056512 2020-03-27 11:29:51 EDT <ggspillthetea> Yes! I have heard that! Which is ridiculous because they have almost no staff answering phones so wait times are insane. We‚Äôve been trying to call Xfinity to get a credit for our week long outage but wait times are 3+ hours
1243553654445150221 2020-03-27 11:01:09 EDT <hooverstreet> Yes, then to learn that the Wi-Fi Outages were because someone has intentionally cut the Xfinity fiber twice in the last two weeks.  Someone really wanted out of a Zoom.
1243550861059674112 2020-03-27 10:50:03 EDT <laugh_leave> Can I say ‚Äúhurry up and repair the outage‚Äù into my remote?
1243550263698481152 2020-03-27 10:47:41 EDT <laugh_leave> Can my Xfinity Voice Remote repair the outage in my area any faster? The repair time keeps getting extended. First it was 4:30am, then 8:30am, and now it says 10:35am. Kids are out of school and bored and I can‚Äôt log in to my work. This is costing me money. Zip code 71292
1243549295124664321 2020-03-27 10:43:50 EDT <NynahNina> @Xfinity is receiving outages in my area so they can't install my new internet today... sorry guys ‚òπ
1243549160646811650 2020-03-27 10:43:18 EDT <laugh_leave> I personally prefer that my internet and cable outage be fixed. The repair time keeps getting extended. First it was 4:30am, then 8:30am, now it‚Äôs 10:30am. The kids are bored. I can‚Äôt log in to my work. How much longer??
1243535373667614726 2020-03-27 09:48:31 EDT <StephaniPeaster> I‚Äôd just prefer my tv to be back on outage be back on at 4:30 am , 8:30 am now 11:30 am üôÑ
1243532916749107200 2020-03-27 09:38:45 EDT <uniongrayband> @comcast @Xfinity outage in Highlands Ranch CO. 3 day est to fix. Governor: ‚Äústay at home‚Äù ‚Äúall biz shut down‚Äù.  @comcast, ‚Äúhold my beer...‚Äù.
1243523643575013376 2020-03-27 09:01:54 EDT <carlycolegrove> For what @Xfinity charges per month, you‚Äôd think I‚Äôd be able to get reliable service that hasn‚Äôt had two outages in the last week alone.
1243520142946045952 2020-03-27 08:48:00 EDT <Jazzi_Elizabeth> Bruh @Xfinity is messing with my money. This outage is keeping me from logging in to work! üò§üò§üò§
1243510134720073729 2020-03-27 08:08:14 EDT <DrBravo2> My @Xfinity service went out last night at 10:45. I was up until 12:30 trying to get it fixed. Comcast insisted there wasn't an outage, so we scheduled an appointment for this morning.  I woke up and it had fixed itself. üò≠
1243505084748759040 2020-03-27 07:48:10 EDT <SababaUSA> my wifi has been down for 36 hours, the in-person Xfinity shop can‚Äôt help, the call center says I‚Äôm 371st in line on hold, and the outage map says they‚Äôre scheduling maintenance for three days from now  pic.twitter.com/HdgbIL7cPC
1243504668216623104 2020-03-27 07:46:30 EDT <BeyondGrave> 4 outages in the past 2 days. Getting really tired of @Xfinity @comcast right about now.
1243496974914957313 2020-03-27 07:15:56 EDT <momentoftru> @comcast @Xfinity there‚Äôs a service outage in my area, and I need to log into work soon. Any idea on what time this will be completed? Zip code 08102.  pic.twitter.com/AJBkBwdwGs
1243454175389851649 2020-03-27 04:25:52 EDT <PocketNeko> there is an outage until 6am if you guys have xfinity üôÉüí¢üí¢
1243453819704487936 2020-03-27 04:24:27 EDT <KirinToudou_osu> Glad @Xfinity is the only thing that's in my area, so that whenever their outages happen I'm completely fucked, really happy with paying for overpriced internet that only works have the time.
1243432421539733505 2020-03-27 02:59:25 EDT <krishnadasmath> Yeah I think we both are experiencing the same problem. It says that there is a network outage in my area and I still have internet. The problem comes whenever I have to upload or stream anything, since my upload bandwidth is way too slow.  pic.twitter.com/1OL9ArBQsa
1243431161004621824 2020-03-27 02:54:25 EDT <bdowney> On average I'm 60-100 Mbps downstream (which seems reasonable). Upstream is the thing having the problems.   The other issue I have is I upgraded my modem, but you can't register a new modem when the network is an outage state (and has been for a week).
1243425913192058884 2020-03-27 02:33:34 EDT <larreewong> @Xfinity There‚Äôs been an outage for the last 10 days in the area. When will you guys be able to fix this? I‚Äôve contacted CS daily and they said it would be fixed yesterday but it‚Äôs still not working. Location is Mountain View, CA. TIA
1243413141251215361 2020-03-27 01:42:49 EDT <EaZ_E_> Open ya Xfinity app and see if there is an outage
1243411377818984449 2020-03-27 01:35:48 EDT <AeroNews> Another day, another several Comcast service outages. Worst ISP ever? #comcastfail @Xfinity @comcast
1243404746741788677 2020-03-27 01:09:27 EDT <tdc953> @xfinity, I bought a new DOCSIS 3.1 modem so I can use the 1 Gbps speed I just purchased from you. I'm getting (degraded) broadband. Amazingly, customers service doesn't let me get through to tech support to configure my modem because there is also an outage in the general area.
1243371730053279744 2020-03-26 22:58:15 EDT <rhagz3131> I've had the best luck with Xfinity for speed, etc. Like any internet though outages happen and they suck.
1243353316635049984 2020-03-26 21:45:05 EDT <ananya2585> There is no outage reported in my area. I ran all troubleshoot. There is no chat with customer care available and the earliest call by agent is available for 31st March 2020. Suggest next steps
1243348678066110465 2020-03-26 21:26:39 EDT <jessjongers> It has been 6 hours with no response, and several days of no internet service! Someone get me online! How is it possible that the outage is going to last until Saturday? It has already been too many days. @comcastcares
1243345426616594437 2020-03-26 21:13:44 EDT <Gabbity> Wait your experiencing outages in your area too?
1243342325822009344 2020-03-26 21:01:25 EDT <alo7610> @Xfinity üò°üò°üò°üò° FIX the outage. It‚Äôs NOT on my end! I just want to relax after a long day as an essential worker. üò°üò°üò°
1243340652798029824 2020-03-26 20:54:46 EDT <marcodemiroz> Daily #internet outages fm @Xfinity & @comcast  ...
1243335933275111427 2020-03-26 20:36:01 EDT <sonicpunk_88> Dear @Xfinity there‚Äôs been an outage in my area for the last 45 minutes.   I kindly ask for a fix asap, thank you.
1243329263018729472 2020-03-26 20:09:30 EDT <vinay_sb> @Xfinity when will you fix outages in my area?
1243322769657528326 2020-03-26 19:43:42 EDT <heythanksharry> @Xfinity now is really not the time for an outage. You guys on it?
1243320444670726144 2020-03-26 19:34:28 EDT <Toncu> We need a better word than interruption at this point. How about "work stopping outage" or "critical infrastructure failure?" I get the challenge of demand far exceeding any capacity planning model, but the grocery store is unimpressed and demands payment. As do you, by the way.
1243316388459995137 2020-03-26 19:18:21 EDT <vinay_sb> @Xfinity I am experiencing network outages everyday this week during peak work hours-10am to 5pm, please help!
1243313460580167681 2020-03-26 19:06:43 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Bryan. If you're in an outage, keep an eye on your My Account app for updates.
1243312650089455617 2020-03-26 19:03:30 EDT <Xfinity> Hi! If you're in an area outage, keep an eye on your My Account app for updates.
1243312024962191365 2020-03-26 19:01:01 EDT <thoughtpalette> Oh @Xfinity, 3 outages in the last week and I've currently been on hold for >30mins and over 372 people in chat support queue. Need some @RCNconnects  in this building.
1243307100316389376 2020-03-26 18:41:26 EDT <jeffsteinmetz> #comcastoutage Day 2 of the Comcast / Xfinity outage in San Francisco, with no communication from the company, no email, nothing.  Realize its hard when their team also needs to WFH, but some customer comms would go a long way.
1243289737185591297 2020-03-26 17:32:27 EDT <karikearnsmd> @comcastcares Really need an update on the internet outage for 80238. I‚Äôve accessed xfinity, viewed website, will get texted when repaired... I need to know a timeline! Hours? Days? Weeks? I‚Äôm a physician. I need to provide virtual care. My kids are missing virtual class.
1243289290127310848 2020-03-26 17:30:40 EDT <Bri82279414> @Xfinity y‚Äôall really aren‚Äôt helping anyone during the outage and it really shows. I wonder how many people are leaving this company after this
1243288863210000384 2020-03-26 17:28:58 EDT <jcp_23> @Xfinity Thanks for working to get our internet back up so quickly after an outage in my area. It‚Äôs appreciated!
1243284219566178304 2020-03-26 17:10:31 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Craig. Check your My Account app, or here:  https://comca.st/2UDqMAB¬† to check if you're in an outage.
1243281491825754113 2020-03-26 16:59:41 EDT <kerry_noonan> It said the outage would be fixed by 3:44 pm and it is not fixed and I can‚Äôt get any information
1243278183539052554 2020-03-26 16:46:32 EDT <MrsPinkychichi> You can‚Äôt verify a wide spread outage without having to login? I‚Äôve got no cable in Tallahassee.
1243274170823315456 2020-03-26 16:30:35 EDT <whosmercedes> There was an outage! And I work from home therefore I couldn‚Äôt do my job this morning!
1243273074771968000 2020-03-26 16:26:14 EDT <TracyRalston> @Xfinity - time for all hands on deck. Never a good time for an outage, but now?  Ugh.  pic.twitter.com/wNCdzHdEHC
1243272671091138560 2020-03-26 16:24:38 EDT <pfilias> Thanks. It came back after about an hour outage.
1243270045859545090 2020-03-26 16:14:12 EDT <Grimm1216> How is one supposed to properly quarantine without internet connection? @Xfinity  This is the 2nd time in the last few days with an outage now. What am I paying for again?
1243269010201993216 2020-03-26 16:10:05 EDT <KCaseyB> @Xfinity  you can‚Äôt be having outages during this ‚ÄúStayInTheHouse‚Äù period   WiFi is down
1243268344024834048 2020-03-26 16:07:26 EDT <BEAUTYWins> Aye @Xfinity @comcastcares this is the second outage this week in my area due to your technicians working in my area. Y‚Äôall are about to get on my nerves!

1243242516637528065 2020-03-26 14:24:48 EDT <iota_subscript> Given that my internet has suffered constant outages since February, I have that one down. My problem is that I basically can‚Äôt work from home with my current level of service, not that I don‚Äôt know that my internet is broken.

1243168223928909824 2020-03-26 09:29:36 EDT <TammyTheCreator> I really dislike that I could not keep my AT&T Internet service. I had to sign up for @Xfinity and I don‚Äôt like them.

1243167803173228544 2020-03-26 09:27:55 EDT <richardmcleod> @Xfinity I have been down for over 32 hours and every 4 hours I am told the outage will be cleared in 4 hours.  #xfinitysucks, #WFH
1243163372637446144 2020-03-26 09:10:19 EDT <Grit_Grind14> I tried to check, but even your outage map is suffering an outage - that‚Äôs how bad you suck.  pic.twitter.com/Cmjx6A7gdg
1243161628851527680 2020-03-26 09:03:23 EDT <nat_singleton> Ok so @Xfinity explain to me why I should even pay for the last (not even) two weeks of service when I‚Äôve had 4 outages for multiple hours each of those days in the 13 days I‚Äôve had my new service turned on???? Last Thursday, 7 hours with no service
1243161096141193218 2020-03-26 09:01:16 EDT <Grit_Grind14> @Xfinity outage - in the midst of the entire nation quarantined at home? If this isn‚Äôt fixed in the next half hour, before my work meetings start, you bet your ass I‚Äôm cancelling my service. I hope you‚Äôre not getting any of that bailout money, as it should go to working co‚Äôs.
1243157669151727623 2020-03-26 08:47:39 EDT <LindaNMcLeod1> #xfinity is THE WORST!  Our service has been down for over 30 hours and we can get a straight answer except your outage will be fixed in 4 hours every 4 hours.  #AT&T here I come!  People need to work from home #xfinitysucks
1243102121920278529 2020-03-26 05:06:56 EDT <MrBotswanamike> @comcast @Xfinity There was an outage in my area early yesterday morning. My internet was "fixed"later in the day, but my latency at times was nearly 2000ms. That is not ok. Please tell me this is going to get fixed.
1243064249477464064 2020-03-26 02:36:26 EDT <willian_fugise> Don‚Äôt worry, seems like xfinity it got a lot worse since the time you switched providers We‚Äôve been getting outages since the last week and when we do have internet, it goes on and off
1243060888652795906 2020-03-26 02:23:05 EDT <jonathanbray> @Xfinity Just finished my 8th working day, unable to work at home due to horrendous internet issues. Your outage reports admit the issue but your phone lines don‚Äôt allow to speak to anyone. How can I get this resolved? I pay for 250 Mb/s download, and you give me this... #please pic.twitter.com/h8MVsXOCYJ
1243034188153933828 2020-03-26 00:36:59 EDT <SteakandChickn> Update 3: @Xfinity @comcast decided they would take responsibility for the outage by fixing their problem while pretending it never happened. This will be going to @BauerKahan and @ericswalwell-this irresponsibility in a time of crisis is unacceptable. https://twitter.com/SteakandChickn/status/1243014450132602885¬†‚Ä¶
1243027421114269696 2020-03-26 00:10:06 EDT <yellaa2you> The fact that @Xfinity hasn‚Äôt fixed this outage is beyond me ...
1243026012033744898 2020-03-26 00:04:30 EDT <ALL_ABOUT_TRESE> Nope. They just said it was an outage and they were working on tint it resolved

1243019326279405568 2020-03-25 23:37:56 EDT <Pmilazz> @comcastcares Hi. This is a bad time for our internet to go down, but it is down. xFinity computers convinced this is an outage, but if it is, we are the only ones on the block. Apparently, no human beings to assist.

1242989059561136129 2020-03-25 21:37:40 EDT <BuccaneersFTW> @Xfinity I've had an outage in my area since at least 5:00pm EST today. I need to know when this will be fixed. I have college course work due tonight at midnight that I can't do without internet.
1242988633063292930 2020-03-25 21:35:58 EDT <bcgaden> Now it shows as reported... but third big outage of the day. At least this one shows up this time
1242985801581035527 2020-03-25 21:24:43 EDT <bcgaden> Thought it was too good to be true @Xfinity  been up and down all day, now losing Internet and TV both - no outage reported in app
1242982600328851461 2020-03-25 21:12:00 EDT <Pwall_18> @Xfinity internet outage going on 5 hours, WHEN ARE U GOING TO FIX THIS
1242982425958866944 2020-03-25 21:11:18 EDT <xlostpunkfoundx> I think if @ComcastCares, they should waive data fees for @XfinityMobile customers whenever there is an @Xfinity internet outage.
1242982306966454273 2020-03-25 21:10:50 EDT <mangomantrap> @Xfinity how do I report an outage because navigating the support on your site has been really frustrating. I'm sure you're probably swamped, but getting this sorted would make my day a whole lot better üôèüèæ
1242978632726962177 2020-03-25 20:56:14 EDT <LovesPatches> there is an outage, how long until it‚Äôs good?
1242975094466588678 2020-03-25 20:42:10 EDT <Xfinity> Are you in an area outage?
1242972125691957248 2020-03-25 20:30:22 EDT <crazydonkey200> Internet outage in my area CA94024 for 3 days already. Xfinity status page said it would be fixed on 03/24 9pm but now the time already passed. Customer service only has automatic responses. This is hard for my family and work. Do you know when it will be fixed? Thanks.
1242970010198454272 2020-03-25 20:21:58 EDT <Xfinity> You can call us at 1-800-XFINITY or set up a call back here:  https://comca.st/2QMDvzL¬†  If you're in an area outage, you can always check on the status via your My Account app.
1242968838922215434 2020-03-25 20:17:19 EDT <Mgbteach> @Xfinity why have you removed any form of personal contact. No phone numbers. This is pathetic. I am so mad with your virtual outages and online live chats.
1242968482288893958 2020-03-25 20:15:54 EDT <Mgbteach> @Xfinity can‚Äôt even find a way to call about service outage. This is ridiculous.
1242966286474326020 2020-03-25 20:07:10 EDT <DJBrown941> @comcast @Xfinity It would be great to actually have Internet & tv service.  Why is every damn outage always seem to include my address. Then they last for several hours at a time.....Can you all get your shit together. Been this way for years!
1242965410045034496 2020-03-25 20:03:41 EDT <NdnaJnz> The app says nothing about an outage. Terrible customer experience. It finally went back on 5 minutes ago, after I missed my whole webinar.

1242953772239904768 2020-03-25 19:17:26 EDT <Xfinity> First, I'd check the Xfinity My Account app to see if there is an outage in the area. If all is showing well there - check out this helpful video:  https://comca.st/2Js4Mnj¬† for ways to improve your WiFi connection if you're not hardwired in.
1242950546727804934 2020-03-25 19:04:37 EDT <Arrogant_MFer> The outage has exceeded every ‚Äúestimated time of completion‚Äù that has been posted today üò§
1242947747721940993 2020-03-25 18:53:30 EDT <Xfinity> Hey! Check your My Account app for info on possible outages in your area.
1242944454992019457 2020-03-25 18:40:25 EDT <ImNotHip> None cause there‚Äôs an xfinity outage in my neighborhood üòí  https://twitter.com/IGN/status/1242926998391054337¬†‚Ä¶
1242941823019913216 2020-03-25 18:29:58 EDT <_renatosantos> And my internet is off for 6 days. Outage in my area never solved. How is that caring about your costumers during this crazy time?
1242941495482687489 2020-03-25 18:28:39 EDT <Xfinity> Your My Account app doesn't indicate you're in any sort of outage?
1242931842002673665 2020-03-25 17:50:18 EDT <Brenzito> What in the actual fuck @Xfinity? 3rd major outage in as many days.... Guess I‚Äôll just go work in the office üò∑. Also, spare me the $2.13 credit on my bill. My company provides an essential service to healthcare providers, so being offline is costing way more than a couple bucks!
1242928750523645952 2020-03-25 17:38:01 EDT <nusairat> Hard to work from home when this is the @Xfinity outage map, which seems to be the outage every afternoon :( ugh  pic.twitter.com/ZY6OSZBqPO
1242922400725024770 2020-03-25 17:12:47 EDT <CrititorQuitit> Thanks #xfinity have my entire family staying at my house and now there is another outage.
1242920391976390673 2020-03-25 17:04:48 EDT <_RegularJoe> @xfinity out of all times to have an outage!
1242919362987790336 2020-03-25 17:00:43 EDT <TheBlakeRodgers> Hey @comcast @Xfinity, tv and internet outages for the 3rd time this week.   Can't schedule a call. Your chat is currently down. When I call it just tells me there's an outage.  Really glad I paid my bill this week.
1242918486323736577 2020-03-25 16:57:14 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Stefanie. If you're in an outage, keep an eye on your My Account app for updates.
1242915344957599744 2020-03-25 16:44:45 EDT <sashapave> I suppose it's clich√©, but @Xfinity earned its reputation for being the most hated company.  After a 2hr wait, please don't aggressive sell me on a TV bundle. I only need you to fix the internet outage that's keeping my kids from school, and us from working.
1242915318336557057 2020-03-25 16:44:38 EDT <iamkimmie25> @Xfinity how can you expect people to work from home if you keep having outages? This is inexcusable and I will be changing providers.
1242908998287966212 2020-03-25 16:19:31 EDT <Xfinity> We can get an update on this outage. Send us a DM here:  https://xfin.tv/support¬† üëà
1242906569056161793 2020-03-25 16:09:52 EDT <xxx000beat> Yes, there's been an outage (77077) since morning. Please I need someone to look into this. It's getting very frustrating particularly when I can't reach customer service. Thanks!
1242905384555368454 2020-03-25 16:05:10 EDT <Xfinity> We can help. Are you seeing an area outage in your My Account app?
1242897939770597376 2020-03-25 15:35:35 EDT <ArtybeingArty> @xfinity is just the worst, just outages in the middle of the day like we all not trying to work from home
1242890581422092295 2020-03-25 15:06:21 EDT <Xfinity> Are you seeing a new estimated time of completion for the outage?
1242887914234806276 2020-03-25 14:55:45 EDT <Arrogant_MFer> They said the outage would‚Äôve been resolved by now.
1242887653357477894 2020-03-25 14:54:42 EDT <Xfinity> Hi. If your My Account app indicates you're in an area outage, keep an eye there for updates!

1242852426534866960 2020-03-25 12:34:44 EDT <JStine81> @comcastcares @Xfinity @comcast There seems to be an outage in our Chicago North Center neighborhood and yet there seems to be no process to report this outage. Happens all the time and is frustrating. Where can I go to actually report this?

1242845231445401600 2020-03-25 12:06:08 EDT <sogand_karbalai> Today's  @Xfinity outage more than 2 hours in DC while many of us #WFH! I hope we don't have more rainy days.
1242840667191218176 2020-03-25 11:48:00 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Bonnie. Keep an eye on the My Account app for any outage updates and alerts.
1242838192660697089 2020-03-25 11:38:10 EDT <Xfinity> We know this is frustrating. Is it showing an end time for this outage?
1242837333889736706 2020-03-25 11:34:45 EDT <socavalier> @comcast @Xfinity  you‚Äôre ruining my day with this internet outage! ü§¨
1242834854926000129 2020-03-25 11:24:54 EDT <eugen_dimant> Hey @comcast @comcastcares @Xfinity, do you mind bringing your daily outages under control in Philadelphia (& elsewhere). More than ever do we rely on stable internet to educate our students. Just because you charge monopolistic prices doesn‚Äôt mean the quality needs to be subpar.  pic.twitter.com/0tk12jtBBw

1242828142928171008 2020-03-25 10:58:14 EDT <michealwpco> @Xfinity why when we need you the most does your service seem to be so bad? Outage in downtown Denver for 2 days now.

1242811362948104192 2020-03-25 09:51:33 EDT <Sneakervisi0n> I text my boss and told him I have an Xfinity outage until 11:15AM...no reply...üòÇüòÇüòÇ He‚Äôs hilarious to me! #Funnyman #WednesdayThoughts #worklife #sneakervision
1242810709567774720 2020-03-25 09:48:58 EDT <urlocalcartoon> Cool and fun that xfinity told me the outage in my area would be fixed by 10am (a reasonable time to start work late) but I just got a text saying it‚Äôs gonna be closer to 2pm (an unreasonable time)
1242799010139664389 2020-03-25 09:02:28 EDT <clux13> @Xfinity REALLY?!?! Great you tell me there‚Äôs an outage and to check the map yet the map is unavailable!!!! For the prices you charge we expect better! üò°  pic.twitter.com/t6Fwe8ydkT
1242793279135125505 2020-03-25 08:39:42 EDT <lsloan0000> Apparently @comcastcares doesn't care very much. I sent them a DM yesterday about an @Xfinity home network outage in my area, but they never responded. So much for #telecommuting during #COVID19.
1242775488227131392 2020-03-25 07:29:00 EDT <LadyShanna92> @Xfinity wtf my internet won't stay up at all!!! Are y'all having an outage?
1242769289871945728 2020-03-25 07:04:22 EDT <kdlphoenix19> @Xfinity how do i find out if there is an outage in my area?
1242749648697085952 2020-03-25 05:46:20 EDT <legalmindedpunk> With my Xfinity internet outage expected to last until 6:33 am (what an oddly specific time), I can't use my voice assistant to turn off all my lights. I have to do it the old fashioned way. What year is this?! 2017?!?!
1242704850917511168 2020-03-25 02:48:19 EDT <tailynkt> @Xfinity this is NOT the time to have outages!!
1242700834191925248 2020-03-25 02:32:21 EDT <Callishhhh> Why is there always an ‚Äúoutage in my area‚Äù....?! @Xfinity get it together please üòÖ
1242696937498869761 2020-03-25 02:16:52 EDT <KingslayerKennl> @Xfinity @comcastcares ever since you gave us the "gift" of upgraded internet service because of the Covid-19 crisis, our internet has been slow as hell or on an outage. Smh.
1242675223549202432 2020-03-25 00:50:35 EDT <_renatosantos> 6 days of outage, in the middle of a lockdown. You guys are a joke. @comcastcares
1242670013061812224 2020-03-25 00:29:53 EDT <oesteban> Great marketing strategy - if only @comcast were able to provide just the services its subscribers are paying for. Seriously, the usual crap of service is much better than any of these promises. Are you going to deduct the 8h (and counting) of #comcastoutage / #XFINITY outage?  https://twitter.com/comcastcares/status/1238879981645725697¬†‚Ä¶
1242661099096465408 2020-03-24 23:54:28 EDT <darinpcarr> @Xfinity @comcastcares get all these emails about network reliability and there‚Äôs another outage. Happening more and more.  Would be nice if xfinity  was actually reliable, especially for what you have to pay each month. #Monopoly
1242633532628852742 2020-03-24 22:04:55 EDT <tdc953> My speed test is showing 500+ Mbps down but only 0.8 up. Is this normal? Is this the effort of the outage?
1242629238534135809 2020-03-24 21:47:52 EDT <Strubey_Doo> @xfinity has to figure out what‚Äôs good with their outages all day today. Everyone is stuck inside and if there‚Äôs one way to start a riot in a time like this, it‚Äôs to take away everyone‚Äôs internet and tv randomly.
1242624613869170688 2020-03-24 21:29:29 EDT <_renatosantos> Why don't you fix my service outage first? 6 days and counting
1242624561138601984 2020-03-24 21:29:16 EDT <Paxmanize> This really irritates me. The amount of times @Xfinity has an outage. It hinders what has to be done because my upload speed is 4MB right now... Wouldn't recommend it to anyone to be honest. Actively looking for other, better solutions.
1242613495004356608 2020-03-24 20:45:18 EDT <Justknw> Why xfinity just have a power outage in my area. I‚Äôm fucked
1242612839862489099 2020-03-24 20:42:42 EDT <Xfinity> Hi. Have you checked your My Account app to see if you're in an outage?
1242602543307423744 2020-03-24 20:01:47 EDT <Xfinity> Hey! You can always check your My Account app to see if you're in an area outage.
1242597701209948164 2020-03-24 19:42:32 EDT <eXplicito63> Our internet has been on and (mostly) off all day, but @Xfinity is saying there isn‚Äôt an outage, had my mom pick up a new modem, and she can‚Äôt get anyone on the phone to troubleshoot.   This is after waiting on hold for 2 hours
1242591314803294209 2020-03-24 19:17:10 EDT <FatalxGoddess> #QuarantineLife without WiFi blows right now! Please @Xfinity fix the outage in my area faster! ü§ûüèºüôèüèº
1242587205152821249 2020-03-24 19:00:50 EDT <virginiadickson> Worse than our neighborhood power outage at 8pm? Grrrr Actually yours was! I watched the Tiger King on Netflix battery lasted the hour till power came back on.
1242584595012489218 2020-03-24 18:50:28 EDT <jjjrrr> 2 things - you can always see Zooms uptime or any outages at  https://status.zoom.us/¬† or you can get @Speedtest and check your connection when things start to go south. Hope that helps.
1242573736789692416 2020-03-24 18:07:19 EDT <tushr1388> Worst customer service ever @comcast @Xfinity . Try calling them during outage and they say their is a wait for 1.5 hours. Received a call back from them after 4 hours and they said since issue does not persist now, they cant do much.
1242573712651620353 2020-03-24 18:07:13 EDT <Xfinity> have you checked your My Account app to see if you're in an area outage?
1242573299445456896 2020-03-24 18:05:35 EDT <AliciaOT> @Xfinity is there an outage in 94117? WiFi has not worked for hours.
1242571142910509056 2020-03-24 17:57:00 EDT <bdowney> Yeah, I figured I wouldn't be changing anything with my existing router, since in an outage it seems like you can't register or re-register "new" devices on the network. [Willing to be proven wrong, but it seems that way!].
1242563478419918849 2020-03-24 17:26:33 EDT <Sequins4Thought> The inevitable @Xfinity outage hit and I‚Äôm 40mins away from an urgent project deadline:   pic.twitter.com/Y8F5RGOtHv

1242546799954386944 2020-03-24 16:20:17 EDT <made__of__stars> EXCELLENT time for @comcast @Xfinity to have an outage. Right in the middle of the workday, gonna be 3-4 hours to fix. üò´

1242531128952659970 2020-03-24 15:18:00 EDT <JEKever> Is there an internet outage in 77025, @Xfinity?

1242523873901531139 2020-03-24 14:49:11 EDT <Bustronaut> Of course not, we never have outages. It must be your equipment, we'll set up a $70 service call to confirm it.
1242523312233893889 2020-03-24 14:46:57 EDT <keithpille> Hey @Xfinity are you having an outage in south Minneapolis?

1242516622050332672 2020-03-24 14:20:22 EDT <bdowney> I mean, I agree. I spotted this outage when I got a Docsis 3.1 modem with more channels -- trying to figure out if it would let me eke out a bit more, but I can't install it since there is a permanent outage.
1242510040239452160 2020-03-24 13:54:12 EDT <melchncookie> @Xfinity when are you going to finally resolve the outage / give us an actual update that isn‚Äôt ‚Äúit says it will be fixed in 4 hours‚Äù. I‚Äôve gotten that response the last 100 hours

1242483180298436608 2020-03-24 12:07:29 EDT <avillanueva3rd> Seriously @Xfinity you guys decide to have an outage when people are working at home in #Houston?
1242471157963673602 2020-03-24 11:19:42 EDT <StevenMenardJr> If @Xfinity can‚Äôt keep the internet running for paying customers, they shouldn‚Äôt be giving it away for free. The outages are getting longer everyday.
1242470015112228864 2020-03-24 11:15:10 EDT <t_rush8> @Xfinity not the best time to have an internet outage.. üôÑ
1242468796347985927 2020-03-24 11:10:19 EDT <Xfinity> We're working to fix this ASAP. If the outage is fixed sooner, and updates will be shown in the app.
1242467870057127942 2020-03-24 11:06:38 EDT <senCyr> Uh...@Xfinity having a internet outage right now is a little more serious.  pic.twitter.com/R8CdUIAi5Z
1242464990579134465 2020-03-24 10:55:12 EDT <__tokyoToni> @Xfinity decides to have an outage in my area while I‚Äôm WFH. Lovely.
1242462052242857984 2020-03-24 10:43:31 EDT <Xfinity> Let's look into this. Are you in an area outage currently?
1242458912491634689 2020-03-24 10:31:03 EDT <Reeeaallly> @Xfinity your service outage map is down in Seattle .. are you having issues here?
1242457450424475648 2020-03-24 10:25:14 EDT <Jamison_Buf> Why is Xfinity having an outage right now. Guess it wasn‚Äôt in the cards for me to work today.  pic.twitter.com/lxFwpjrhMS
1242457343603998721 2020-03-24 10:24:49 EDT <Xfinity> Hello. Has the My Account app shown any area outages? If you don't have the My Account app you can locate it here:  https://comca.st/2QHYVhH¬†.
1242454233909166080 2020-03-24 10:12:27 EDT <Xfinity> Are you currently in an outage?
1242444104409190404 2020-03-24 09:32:12 EDT <Xfinity> Okay. Is the My Account app showing any service interruptions in the area? If you do not have the My Account app you can locate it here:  https://comca.st/2WFLKBF¬†. This app will allow you to keep an eye on any outages in your area.
1242442153894297605 2020-03-24 09:24:27 EDT <Xfinity> We know this is frustrating. Do you see an estimated end time for the outage in your area.
1242438937160945665 2020-03-24 09:11:40 EDT <Heather_Meadows> There‚Äôs no way that @Xfinity is serious right now. Dozens of outages in my neighborhood in the past few days when they know everyone is working from home and needs the internet!
1242437948588556298 2020-03-24 09:07:44 EDT <Xfinity> We know this is frustrating. Are you seeing an estimated end time for this outage in your My Account app?
1242431442895994883 2020-03-24 08:41:53 EDT <kevinjthull> Thanks @Xfinity for your continued outages. You are providing a consistent experience. It‚Äôs the opposite of what we pay for, but it‚Äôs consistent.
1242431031053074432 2020-03-24 08:40:15 EDT <Xfinity> Hi. Are you seeing an estimated end time for this outage?
1242428558640848897 2020-03-24 08:30:26 EDT <ajmoneyy> what a great day for an internet/tv outage @Xfinity - not trying to work or anything here..
1242333242046414850 2020-03-24 02:11:40 EDT <engeeyasha> & xfinity decides to have an outage right now Greaaat
1242313088122130433 2020-03-24 00:51:35 EDT <JacobiJones10> There would be an internet outage when I‚Äôm trying to play 2K @Xfinity
1242296651508674561 2020-03-23 23:46:17 EDT <BastardGrimm> Just in case it's not a signal issue, did you try using a different DNS? Their default server could have crapped out.  You can also look up the Xfinity outage map near your area.  The issues I had with them in the past, which seem to be the most persistent, is modem provisioning.
1242293411199107074 2020-03-23 23:33:24 EDT <jensmithpalmer> Not a good look @Xfinity . Three day customer outage and no human response?
1242282157546057728 2020-03-23 22:48:41 EDT <CptWinki> @Xfinity is there a system outage in federal way  Washington.  No internet. Logged everyone in my house off about 30 minutes ago. Hard reset it now 4 times.

1242250708163887106 2020-03-23 20:43:43 EDT <orochi235> @Xfinity why can i not even report a fucking outage without suffering through your 2 hour queues? my tv service is broken. please fucking fix it
1242232458483040258 2020-03-23 19:31:12 EDT <Triddy_Flankers> If Verizon can have a tech at my house tomorrow, I am canceling @Xfinity tonight. Can‚Äôt deal with these outages anymore.
1242229405788835841 2020-03-23 19:19:04 EDT <iamdesireb> Xfinity having an outage rn is terrible timing.
1242222855984680960 2020-03-23 18:53:02 EDT <Xfinity> Are you in an area outage?
1242222752322531328 2020-03-23 18:52:38 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked through the Xfinity My Account app to see if there is an outage being worked on?
1242219579423817728 2020-03-23 18:40:01 EDT <terrishapiro> Thanks @Xfinity for resolving our outage!!  Very much appreciated esp during this time!!!!  Great service.

1242214601984339968 2020-03-23 18:20:15 EDT <jibbitzer> @Xfinity @comcastcares is the outage in San Jose, CA area ever gonna end? Tired of not having WiFi
1242211642894581768 2020-03-23 18:08:29 EDT <KMICKEYESQ> Of all the times to have a service outage,  THEN to come back up and the damn modems won't work. @Xfinity is the WORST!! I definitely should have stayed with @ATT. An internet outage when being forced to work from home is ridamndiculous! üò°ü§¨
1242202476633370626 2020-03-23 17:32:04 EDT <megztine> Internet outage ALL DAY yesterday and now we have another outage until 8:30. Come onnn @Xfinity this is ridiculous.

1242169129844563968 2020-03-23 15:19:33 EDT <Xfinity> Hi, do you know if you are in an area wide outage, or is this specific to your services? You can track the status of your services through the My Account app. If you still need help contact our support team through Twitter here:  https://xfin.tv/support¬†.
1242168295408709633 2020-03-23 15:16:14 EDT <smokemyjai> @comcast @Xfinity I need reimbursement for all these outages üòí

1242167403657801730 2020-03-23 15:12:42 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked if there was an outage or maintenance going on in the area? You can do so through the My Account app.
1242163606533197830 2020-03-23 14:57:36 EDT <yungsheeks> @Xfinity telling me there‚Äôs an outage in my area (despite my immediate neighbor having WiFi) and that I can check the Xfinity app for updates, but of course the app is saying ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt log on during an outage‚Äù... is the fuckin riddler in charge of this company?
1242159331568746500 2020-03-23 14:40:37 EDT <Xfinity> You can check the Xfinity My Account app to see if there is an outage in your area.
1242158095415029765 2020-03-23 14:35:42 EDT <coreyspin> I was ready to start this week with positivity and a can do attitude. But that hasn‚Äôt happened thanks to @Xfinity having an outage on a day when we are all forced to work from home üôÑüôÑüôÑ
1242147432848404483 2020-03-23 13:53:20 EDT <comcast> Is there an outage in the area? You can check the Xfinity My Account app to verify. -Gabbie
1242143674022035456 2020-03-23 13:38:24 EDT <bdowney> It's now Day 4 of a @comcast/@xfinity outage in Mountain View. Comcast has removed all ability to call them or be called by them, has no ETA, and the one tech I spoke to said the ticket was empty.   These are trying times, but communicate with us.  #comcastoutage #mountainview pic.twitter.com/mCeIfpsNua
1242143389967093760 2020-03-23 13:37:16 EDT <weeoutcheaaa> Bro how is xfinity having a outage in the middle of quarantine
1242141984070008833 2020-03-23 13:31:41 EDT <Griffdawg_Sully> @Xfinity Dear friends, if you have SCHEDULED outages you really need to warn your customers that they are upcoming especially with the entire workforce working from home. Sincerely - a customer missing an important meeting when he could have planned ahead.
1242138753755418634 2020-03-23 13:18:51 EDT <DasKota> Comcast should be fined when they have internet outages, or give people money off of their bill prorated based on how much downtime they have during a given billing period. It‚Äôs ridiculous that hundreds of thousands of #xfinity users in Chicago are just SOL right now.
1242138429044879370 2020-03-23 13:17:33 EDT <its_soph> @Xfinity what BS. There‚Äôs an internet outage in our area for almost a week. You guys keep extending the ETA for fixing it for another 4 hours everytime you missed it, for the WHOLE WEEK! Called customer service, they don‚Äôt know anything. FIX IT PLS! #fail
1242134083251195904 2020-03-23 13:00:17 EDT <Xfinity> Hi, do you know iif this is specific to your service or are you in an area-wide outage?
1242129579545944068 2020-03-23 12:42:24 EDT <kat_vicari> @Xfinity Hi, there‚Äôs an outage in area code 60657 right now. This is the 2nd outage I‚Äôve experienced in 48 hours. How soon will service be reinstated? With so many people working from home, how can you ensure this doesn‚Äôt happen in the future?
1242122702560919558 2020-03-23 12:15:04 EDT <Xfinity> Are you in an area outage currently? Are there any updates in your My Account app?
1242121687681789952 2020-03-23 12:11:02 EDT <elsy_kaur> Just when I thought I would get a head start on my work, there is an internet outage üò≠ @Xfinity

1242117403930243072 2020-03-23 11:54:01 EDT <sarrrra05> @Xfinity hi! Since there‚Äôs an outage in my area until 3pm, and your hotspot isn‚Äôt working. What do you recommend for people working from home?! This is crazy
1242117190859526144 2020-03-23 11:53:10 EDT <Breezy0408> @Xfinity As someone who NEEDS internet to fucking graduate, I'm going to need a little compensation for the amount of outages happening recently. Don't promise something you can't uphold.
1242115234766209024 2020-03-23 11:45:24 EDT <nickseguin> Do you have a link so we can check area outages?
1242114055361396736 2020-03-23 11:40:42 EDT <Xfinity> We can help. Are you currently in an area outage?
1242110127647461400 2020-03-23 11:25:06 EDT <toby_fanning> @Xfinity @comcast @comcastcares how do I go about submitting a claim for compensation for the regular internet outages I experience with your service?
1242106335954640897 2020-03-23 11:10:02 EDT <Curtiks> Wow! #HappyMonday @Xfinity. No better way to start the first day back than to have an internet outage. And no going out to work at a coffee shop. ‚ÄúWill be resolved by 3pm.‚Äù ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
1242102300413513728 2020-03-23 10:54:00 EDT <mphslee> @Xfinity I see you are at it again. Outage again!  This makes every weekday since 3/11! Unacceptable!!
1242092659558223873 2020-03-23 10:15:41 EDT <aobrien7> No choice but to work from home, but @Xfinity has an outage in my area. The estimated time for it to be resolved is 2 p.m. today, per their site. No bueno.
1242080847089590272 2020-03-23 09:28:45 EDT <Fyoochur629> Oh its defindown in the Chicago area. The outage map looks large.
1241973954832674817 2020-03-23 02:24:00 EDT <Tiffany_Majesty> @Xfinity What is going on with the internet outages???? Not a good time to leave people with no entertainment.
1241944854936068096 2020-03-23 00:28:22 EDT <vinivinidogo> Apparently @Xfinity appears to be having major outages nationally starting around last Thursday   Of course nobody is answering the phone & their app isn‚Äôt even accurate  ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1241941671694069761 2020-03-23 00:15:43 EDT <_renatosantos> @Xfinity @comcastcares we have an outage in our service since Thursday, and nothing is fixed for 4 days already. In a crazy time, quarantined, this is when we needed internet and connection the most. It's so disappointing to not have your support. Called your team 10+ times (1/2)
1241897574598168576 2020-03-22 21:20:29 EDT <rarecandyslice> i been having outages since last week. smh now it‚Äôs saying there‚Äôs no outage, but my streaming is still choppy
1241897322029764609 2020-03-22 21:19:29 EDT <m_kellishiv> We had an outage in our area too üò§üò§
1241894211068162049 2020-03-22 21:07:07 EDT <sfnicow> @comcastcares what is going on with the outage in San Rafael CA? 6 days of internet outage when we need you the most! Do we pay that much for this kind of reliability? @Xfinity @comcast  At least provide us with a valid ETA so that can take the proper measures... pic.twitter.com/dB96c2Us9e
1241877080578633734 2020-03-22 19:59:03 EDT <josh_reed94> Is there an outage for xbox users to plan ranked matches @Rainbow6Game? My ISP is Xfinity. Everytime I try to join a ranked match, matchmaking gets and error.
1241859829909594113 2020-03-22 18:50:30 EDT <wine4lfe> Anyone in Golden Valley MN experiencing #xfinity TV outages now!
1241849242777518080 2020-03-22 18:08:26 EDT <iyface> @XfinitySupport Lets try this Xfinity Handle.   Hey, why am I still in an outage when supposedly the outage was repaired?   Unable to pull consistent speeds and modem is throwing errors immediately after reboot.
1241848865210404864 2020-03-22 18:06:56 EDT <iyface> @Xfinity just notified that the outage is resolved.  Checking speed tests and not even able to pull 35mbs.  That is a significant increase from 19mbs.   But still not the 600mbs that I'm paying for.  How is the outage resolved?
1241843177570603009 2020-03-22 17:44:20 EDT <Christina62> @comcastcares this is the 5th time my internet has gone out this weekend. I get that things are unprecedented but it‚Äôs SUNDAY and most people are not at work. Fix your shit @xfinity or I‚Äôm going to start measurinf you these outages and deducting it from the monthly bill.  pic.twitter.com/e6DW3MUlAn
1241825148228911104 2020-03-22 16:32:41 EDT <bdowney> One thing I discovered is that you can't actually call Xfinity when they're having an outage. Their number even tells you this.   You can, however, schedule a callback for the future, and I got one Saturday morning.
1241823064180101120 2020-03-22 16:24:25 EDT <rokkitx> @Xfinity has been really horrible this last few months, but even worse during this ‚Äòsocial distancing‚Äô.  Random drops like crazy.  No outages showing up in the app.  Neighbors also complaining  Service here has always been spotty, but has crashed at the worst time.
1241815016484925440 2020-03-22 15:52:26 EDT <JoleneAurora> Hey, @Xfinity I know you guys have a lot of users rn with the quarantine and such, but my service is so consistently spotty with issues and when I needed you most, you vanished! Pls fix my bill for your outages and the lack of consistency or get it to work! Thank you!
1241807481115783174 2020-03-22 15:22:29 EDT <SharmilaCommins> Yes, ours has been choppy at best and down for 1 week in Redwood City. How does anyone WFH with no internet. You state on their site that there is an outage. But, no update for 1 week now. BS for paying so much monthly. Xfinity are you going to pay for my AT&T hotspot usage?
1241805659215032320 2020-03-22 15:15:15 EDT <GlennRubenstein> Is anyone else‚Äôs @Xfinity internet down?  It‚Äôs a 12 hour wait to talk to customer service.  App isn‚Äôt showing any outages in my area (Petaluma, CA) but my Arris cable modem powers on then doesn‚Äôt connect.
1241804428161585152 2020-03-22 15:10:21 EDT <SharmilaCommins> You can create this, but you can't fix the outage in areas where these folks are working from home?!?!?
1241803976586063872 2020-03-22 15:08:34 EDT <SharmilaCommins> @Xfinity @comcastcares Internet has been intermittent - sometime none since last Monday in 94061. When will it be fixed? It's been 1 week! This is BS, esp. when trying to WFH! You state that you know there is an outage, but NO UPDATE! Will you credit everyone's account?
1241770859741827075 2020-03-22 12:56:58 EDT <reitz_crackaaa> hey @Xfinity how can you be such a garbage internet company?? there‚Äôs literally nothing else to do but watch tv and you can‚Äôt even manage to go 5 seconds without outages

1241756899168735232 2020-03-22 12:01:30 EDT <TurboVonStab> @Xfinity @comcast @comcastcares can we get to work on this Chicago area outage? Service has been SH*T for 12 hours.

1241716271743410176 2020-03-22 09:20:03 EDT <MikeJanssenWX> The automated system says it will be fixed this morning, but no matter what this isn‚Äôt a good time for @Xfinity to have an outage in my neighborhood.  pic.twitter.com/VsVLCLuGVo
1241706696914939906 2020-03-22 08:42:00 EDT <yancey_jycubed> @comcastcares please don‚Äôt tell me that Xfinity / Comcast would throttle back there services on Sunday morning when so much of the world needs to be able to attend worship services streaming. I find it too ironic that my area has just experienced an outage
1241605908754345984 2020-03-22 02:01:31 EDT <its_soph> @Xfinity what BS. There‚Äôs an internet outage in our area for almost a week. You guys keep extending the ETA for fixing it for another 4 hours everytime you missed it, for the WHOLE WEEK! Called customer service, they don‚Äôt know anything. FIX IT PLS! #fail
1241605402258591746 2020-03-22 01:59:30 EDT <its_soph> what BS. There‚Äôs an internet outage in our area for almost a week.

1241605082837323777 2020-03-22 01:58:14 EDT <NewLogic_0> @Xfinity please check for Internet outages in 30067.
1241593521137565697 2020-03-22 01:12:17 EDT <TheCptnObvus> @comcast @Xfinity has been having outage in my area for over 4 days now. How can service outage be this long in a Metropolitan area? This is horrid... You should be giving your affected customer a credit for the days of the outage. #comcastoutage #comcastsucks
1241590082890498048 2020-03-22 00:58:38 EDT <TheresaKereakes> Hey anyone in #EastNashville #LockelandSprings #ShelbyHills having intermittent internet outage from Comcast/Xfinity? Been this way since 4pm - original outage was fixed but now it‚Äôs on & off. Unlikely to get help from Comcast at this hour - just want to know if its just me
1241588773198000128 2020-03-22 00:53:25 EDT <MInteriorsMarin> @Xfinity and @comcast you are testing my patience. Please fix this outage. I think it‚Äôs only my house. None of my neighbors are having an issue.
1241583839383883776 2020-03-22 00:33:49 EDT <RealSenpaiTV> @Xfinity this is third time today, help me out. Why are my services off with no reported outages in my area ??  pic.twitter.com/LzrZjhfJPk
1241576282455826432 2020-03-22 00:03:47 EDT <oregonamybaird> Anyone noticing that there‚Äôs an outage of @MSNBC on @Xfinity ?? @JoyAnnReid @maddow @MaddowBlog
1241552689680527362 2020-03-21 22:30:02 EDT <amberroseoatman> @Xfinity now is not the time to have an outage üòë
1241535673418555392 2020-03-21 21:22:25 EDT <Tanky171> @Xfinity YOU GUYS NEED TO GET THE CEO UP AND FIX THIS OUTAGE!! #QuaratineLife #nointernet #CoronavirusPandemic #fixitquick #itsnotfree
1241518027251818496 2020-03-21 20:12:18 EDT <iyface> @Xfinity Really, please what is going on is Chicago with the Cable Internet Services?   I've been in a queue since 3:00pm.  Status of outage is will be repaired 3:00 pm 3/23?   What is that about?
1241509389128929281 2020-03-21 19:37:59 EDT <iyface> @Xfinity what is going on?  My service area has been surrounded by outages for the past FOUR Weeks and now my specific area is in a service outage for the PAST WEEK!  Queue times via call and chat are INSANE?  What did you think was going to happen when the country is WFH!
1241462963501850624 2020-03-21 16:33:30 EDT <kuhtryna> My sister brought Animal Crossing over so we could play it on her switch and Xfinity is having another outage. I‚Äôm so hurt
1241460808913166336 2020-03-21 16:24:56 EDT <saythatseare> I'm about to change my internet and cable service @Xfinity y'all always have an outage somewhere. THIS IS THE WRONG TIME üò©
1241459026753437697 2020-03-21 16:17:51 EDT <_LLeonn> Hey @Xfinity why in the fuck are there outages every fucking day for these last two weeks? You fucking idiots can‚Äôt keep some stable service up for a whole month? @ATT hit my line when you get gig speed in my area. These fucking dweebs at Comcast are stealing my money
1241448765753413632 2020-03-21 15:37:05 EDT <thesalesmethod> @Xfinity has the absolute worst CS I have ever experience. I've been on hold going on an hour now. The rep was so rude. apparently, outages are my responsibility. How are they still in business? Finally, found the motivation to switch providers. Any recommendations?
1241426429960544257 2020-03-21 14:08:20 EDT <modriver88fan> @xfinity what is with all of the outages lately? You keep charging me more & more, yet you're taking channels away & having more outages. Where are the account credits for lost days of service?
1241359928541011968 2020-03-21 09:44:04 EDT <SaraSmallTV> Thank you! Incredibly frustrating. Most times they tell us we‚Äôre ‚Äúnot included in the outage‚Äù and they it‚Äôs our equipment. But the outage happens every time an area near us has one too. Ugh. üò©
1241357163546783746 2020-03-21 09:33:05 EDT <pjweakly> @Xfinity when will my service be up? Do not refer me to your false status board this outage fix time keeps moving when it passes.

1241197949843058688 2020-03-20 23:00:26 EDT <pjweakly> OK at this point I  am interpreting your apathy of continuous outage as a complete carelessness of the current state of our country.  It is obvious that I cannot work from home. It is obvious I cannot trust you to provide what is needed.  pic.twitter.com/Ie8xg65YJh
1241197329669120001 2020-03-20 22:57:58 EDT <jrmckins> I just had a 10 minute outage and lost my shit. I'm not sure how you're dealing with this.
1241189543220588544 2020-03-20 22:27:01 EDT <1smitmit> @Xfinity would be nice to have reliable service during our quarantine! Outage for HOURS is 77365
1241189335300358144 2020-03-20 22:26:12 EDT <VibinWoosh> Wtf @Xfinity??  Been on hold almost 2 fucking hours?  Service outage for like 24 hours??  #comcastoutage pic.twitter.com/ScNHZ9yHrn

1241184830097960960 2020-03-20 22:08:18 EDT <DirtyBirdVT> @Xfinity what the fuck! We‚Äôre stuck in quarantine in our fucking house and you have a fucking outage in our neighbohood!  pic.twitter.com/k9zCFZfAJo
1241177989284376576 2020-03-20 21:41:07 EDT <StevenMKestner> @Xfinity do you have an internet outage in your he SF Bay Area right now?
1241174232207437830 2020-03-20 21:26:11 EDT <iamkimmie25> It‚Äôs an outage that they are not letting their customers know about.
1241169475807989761 2020-03-20 21:07:17 EDT <abhi15hunk> How about give the internet with out outages....no internet for 5 days in this week...
1241168739804033025 2020-03-20 21:04:22 EDT <iamkimmie25> @Xfinity how can I work from home if y‚Äôall keep having outages??
1241168552905912325 2020-03-20 21:03:37 EDT <NathanCodd> @Xfinity any updates for all these outages in #SF?
1241166681906360320 2020-03-20 20:56:11 EDT <SkyHigh14DL> @Xfinity can anyone help me with a question about an outage?
1241166605108699136 2020-03-20 20:55:53 EDT <Lvovsky> Finally @xfinity app posted that there is outage in Albuquerque area. What took you so long? The phone not made me reset my modem three time and I am waiting to talk to some o e for 3+ hours @Comcast
1241164830058385408 2020-03-20 20:48:49 EDT <Spangdaddy> First night in IL under shelter in place and outage till 1130 PM CT
1241159871141044225 2020-03-20 20:29:07 EDT <bdowney> In my neighborhood, Comcast has had an "outage" for 24 hours. Average upstream is ~1Mbps (I pay for 100x that).
1241158474517676032 2020-03-20 20:23:34 EDT <MzP_Burtley> Can‚Äôt even work from home üôÑDef don‚Äôt got time to be dealing with @Xfinity having a outage right now...
1241154955400093696 2020-03-20 20:09:35 EDT <CrowdPleaseHER6> @Xfinity would choose to have a outage during a pandemic when we can‚Äôt go nowhere... wtf man

1241149815674806276 2020-03-20 19:49:10 EDT <xplosivememory> Leave it to @Xfinity to completely whiff in a crisis. Not sure what‚Äôs worse, their infrastructure or third-rate customer service. Been on hold 2 hrs! #outage
1241144689371176961 2020-03-20 19:28:47 EDT <connieezy> Of course my internet would get knocked out right now as I‚Äôm trying to send a last-minute plan for a Monday start. And of course we look out & see the damn Xfinity truck right outside causing this outage üòë
1241135861086875648 2020-03-20 18:53:43 EDT <NathanCodd> Really, @Xfinity? A complete outage? Right now? :|  #ShelterInPlace #sflockdown #Covid_19 #SanFranciscoLockDown
1241134986905993217 2020-03-20 18:50:14 EDT <geo_girl_1999> @comcastcares My Xfinity services have been down since a power outage this morning. What is going on? When will it be fixed?
1241125727791206402 2020-03-20 18:13:27 EDT <gmasonii> @xfinity How can you be so unprepared.  An all day outage when people are working from home and kids are trying to do school work?
1241115900712976384 2020-03-20 17:34:24 EDT <redslayerxr5> There is an Service outage in my neighborhood for the second time this week and the only thing xfinity says for the second time is to use their equipment instead of my one. Xfinity fucking sucks at responding to outages. #xfinityisgarbage
1241111071852806146 2020-03-20 17:15:12 EDT <Dsmall73> 6 hour outage... this is ridiculous..
1241108917800886273 2020-03-20 17:06:39 EDT <derek5280> Third day in a row of an @Xfinity web outage in Stapleton. Same time the last three days....
1241106317072269312 2020-03-20 16:56:19 EDT <ashcashhxo> Gonna need @Xfinity to credit my account for this outage
1241100377052848128 2020-03-20 16:32:43 EDT <Xfinity> We know this is frustrating. Do you see an end time for this outage in your My Account app?
1241098461274968064 2020-03-20 16:25:06 EDT <garlic_n_onion> That‚Äôs great! But can you fix the outage so I can actually use what data I do pay for?
1241096070769319936 2020-03-20 16:15:36 EDT <settlemlCFB> @Xfinity our internet is still down. Has been since about 11:30 last night. Any idea how long the outage may last?
1241094377142812672 2020-03-20 16:08:52 EDT <damnSUZ> @comcast @Xfinity you have got to fix the outage in Seattle ASAP!! We‚Äôre all working from home!!!

1241090366931185664 2020-03-20 15:52:56 EDT <Xfinity> Hi, are you aware of an outage in your area or is it specific to your services?

1241082637579694081 2020-03-20 15:22:13 EDT <Xfinity> Hey. Are you in an area outage?
1241082523733471233 2020-03-20 15:21:46 EDT <kaigray> Greetings from paradise. "An XFINITY Services outage has been reported in your area. We're working hard to get your service up and running. The issue will be resolved 03/20/2020 04:06 PM (Pacific)"
1241081059061772289 2020-03-20 15:15:57 EDT <jasondbutler> @Xfinity still struggling & virtually no speed. Tests are consistently below 7mps and in and out. Sent a message to support and no response. App shows outage near me but says my place is fine. #frustrated
1241078186781356033 2020-03-20 15:04:32 EDT <Xfinity> Are you seeing an area outage in your My Account app?
1241077329935372289 2020-03-20 15:01:08 EDT <abhi15hunk> @Xfinity @comcastcares outage again today too...just this week alone 4days complete outage from morning to evening...and 1 day outages scatter during the day....so basically no internet at all this week. Still didnt count sat and sun...#coronavirus #xfinitynotreliable
1241076760030015489 2020-03-20 14:58:52 EDT <jbeldock> @Xfinity @comcast @comcastcares still *THIRD* day of internet "outage fixed in 4 hours", updated every time to "another 4 hours". 11th reschedule just now; still no reply from you/Cust. Sup't. We rely on you to connect us during #ShelterInPlace #Covid19. How do we get your help?!
1241072853581271043 2020-03-20 14:43:20 EDT <LuckFNBR> Outages in my area for 6hrs atleast 2 times a month >
1241068577651937280 2020-03-20 14:26:21 EDT <Loupert17> @comcastcares @Xfinity this outage in Chicago is insane, during this time when people have to work from home, we have no internet???? And it's been in and out last few days. This is unacceptable
1241066920498966528 2020-03-20 14:19:46 EDT <SFboyStars> I am outage of your service. You guys are offer 60 days of unlimited data usage, but I am paying $50 a month. I called to asked for credit and I was told to cancel my unlimited data plan in order to get the free 60 days, then call back to add the unlimited plan after the 60 days!
1241065672135843840 2020-03-20 14:14:48 EDT <iKerochu> @Xfinity @comcast this is ridiculous. my internet went out the same time yesterday.   with no one to talk to or any help to be offered this is unacceptable. you clearly have THOUSANDS of people working from home yet not means for them to get assistance when outages occur.
1241064993224888323 2020-03-20 14:12:06 EDT <iKerochu> .@Xfinity apparently you can only check the outage map if you login however if you click it you get an access denied message.   To restart the modem it does the same thing. There are no representatives to talk to, what the fuck is going on?  pic.twitter.com/308GMaKC1u
1241063080894836738 2020-03-20 14:04:30 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Nicole. Try to keep an eye on the My Account app for outage updates and alerts. If you don't have the My Account app you can access it here:  https://comca.st/2UpPuUR¬†.
1241060232488337408 2020-03-20 13:53:11 EDT <bdowney> @Comcast and @xfinity have shown as having an outage in Mountain View for at least the last six hours. These speeds are what we've been getting reliably at home all week.   I understand there's a crisis, but Comcast literally won't speak to you when there is an outage.  pic.twitter.com/poZnhK1QwP

Meanwhile they kept telling me ‚Äúno outages reported‚Äù
1241014052337463298 2020-03-20 10:49:41 EDT <Xfinity> You can keep track of the status of the outage through the Xfinity My Account app.

1240982009977212928 2020-03-20 08:42:22 EDT <marquitanicole> So @Xfinity just have an outage during the covid-19 crisis when hundreds of thousands of children are home from school doing work online or entertainment themselves during a break from any school work they‚Äôre doing. TV and internet needs to be back well before 12:30pm.  pic.twitter.com/Sb1gu8Yb24
1240975432670904320 2020-03-20 08:16:14 EDT <aroliver01> I swear to GOD, if @Xfinity  doesn‚Äôt get their SHIT together we r looking else where for internet/cable/cell All fuckkng week my Internet has  been down in the morning & now there‚Äôs an outage for ‚ÄúMaintenance repairs‚Äù. people HAVE  to work from HOME ! First it was 6 AM now it‚Äôs 8  pic.twitter.com/LntbnWuQry
1240938963570790402 2020-03-20 05:51:19 EDT <bdowney> I know a lot is going on, but the Xfinity outage in my area has been going on for nearly 12 hours.   Note that talking to the @xfinity bot cheerfully explains it will be fixed by 3/19 4:59pm PST. It is now 3/20. :P
1240930532973842432 2020-03-20 05:17:49 EDT <freddiebmusic90> So much for chilling after work, there‚Äôs a WiFi, phone and TV outage in my area. Please fix ASAP @Xfinity @comcastcares @comcast
1240909285934186498 2020-03-20 03:53:23 EDT <cassieebx3> Did anyone‚Äôs xfinity just have a quick outage ? Lowkey I kinda panicked
1240900789276741633 2020-03-20 03:19:37 EDT <ben_alex8> @Xfinity every single damn day! There's an outage! You guys are overpriced and overrated ! CenturyLink rarely had this issue when I had them. I'm switching back to them! Terrible service! Overpriced! I hope you guys go bankrupt! Nobody deserves such terrible service!
1240889355289460736 2020-03-20 02:34:11 EDT <wolfkaosaun> Xfinity with the 2nd outage this week.  Tom Nook wouldn't treat me like this
1240871995144900609 2020-03-20 01:25:12 EDT <SFNxTPx> @Xfinity why must y‚Äôall have an outage like every night üò≠üò≠
1240865979623710722 2020-03-20 01:01:18 EDT <ripvyi> Xfinity‚Äôs second outage for me this week. Smh
1240856375758127104 2020-03-20 00:23:08 EDT <SynergyByDesign> @comcast/@Xfinity #Telephone, #TV and #Internet are all OUT in Michigan. üò£ Perfect Timing, Morons! #yousuck #coronavirus #COVID19 #outage #promisespromises
1240847622505668608 2020-03-19 23:48:21 EDT <skyenpjsmom> @Xfinity is there an outage? I have no service.
1240830748522733569 2020-03-19 22:41:18 EDT <Katanderina> @Xfinity I‚Äôve been without cable for 3 days and crap internet as well. Today no internet. Customer service is unavailable and no answer as to what is going on. When will the outage end?
1240825807578284033 2020-03-19 22:21:40 EDT <julian_mino> @Xfinity going 4 hours with this outage. Any updates on when the service will be restored?
1240817817835827200 2020-03-19 21:49:55 EDT <jbeldock> @xfinity @comcast notified me of *EIGHTH* straight delay in fixing service outage. Pushed out *ANOTHER FOUR* hours. Still nobody can explain problem or give a straight answer about resolution time. We are all relying on you to connect us while we #ShelterInPlace; need your help!
1240806088511012868 2020-03-19 21:03:19 EDT <mgir_18> Why are we paying so much for Xfinity when there‚Äôs at least one big internet outage a month?
1240805418433048576 2020-03-19 21:00:39 EDT <trisrrhatesmark> Why do u have outages every 2 weeks?
1240798737804300288 2020-03-19 20:34:06 EDT <DavidRPierce89> @Xfinity can you please tell me if there's an outage in my area this is the worst time to have one thanks
1240798392483303424 2020-03-19 20:32:44 EDT <cbibeau72> @Xfinity hey, lots of intermittent outages and I can't report on your website. Messing up the night!
1240797638145916930 2020-03-19 20:29:44 EDT <jbeldock> @Xfinity @comcast Second day of "outage will be fixed in 4 hours"--updated every time to "another 4 hours". Customer support useless; says only "will be fixed in 4 hours". Why can nobody fix a simple outage?!  (Hillsborough CA)
1240782300826062848 2020-03-19 19:28:47 EDT <amits91> @comcastcares when will you fix the outage. It‚Äôs been 4 days without internet. Unable to work from home, can‚Äôt watch TV. Please fix the internet. @Xfinity
1240775904873164800 2020-03-19 19:03:22 EDT <nyoungjinkrap> YO YOU CANT BE HAVING OUTAGES RIGHT NOW EVERYONE‚ÄôS WORKING FROM HOME @Xfinity @comcastcares
1240774249985400832 2020-03-19 18:56:48 EDT <BradBelstock> Hearing of a fairly significant Comcast outage in Walnut Creek and Pleasant Hill. @Xfinity
1240769539995918336 2020-03-19 18:38:05 EDT <EmilyStanger1> @Xfinity @comcast down off and on all day. I'm told when I call there is no outage when there clearly is. Anyone else having these issues? I have to work from home and I need internet to do this.
1240766360788951041 2020-03-19 18:25:27 EDT <eldang> I see @xfinity getting a lot of good publicity for making free wifi available, but it has to work.  Currently there's an outage for the entire area their map will show around me, for at least the next few hours.  Normally I'd go to a cafe or the office, but....
1240765490437525514 2020-03-19 18:21:59 EDT <andrewkstaley> Great job @comcast/@comcastcares/@Xfinity! Internet and TV out again!!! Sure glad there isn‚Äôt a pandemic going on‚Ä¶ oh wait. I just hope the government isn‚Äôt relying on your service.  @Verizon Wireless & @Visible saves the day! #fails #coronavirus #outage  pic.twitter.com/pKq33sOB0l
1240747552816934922 2020-03-19 17:10:43 EDT <MrStreatrr> and now Xfinity is experiencing an outage, smh. Look, I don't give a fuck about there not being any food, paper towels, or toilet paper, or hand sanitizer, but I will go full on Purge of the Flies if these niggas don't fix my internet service
1240737930475450369 2020-03-19 16:32:29 EDT <barackyourworld> Xfinity/Comcast- you embarrassed me on a conference call in front of 100 people. 5 minutes before presenting a project I‚Äôve worked on for 6 months you decide to perform maintenance and give me an outage. Your service is ghetto and I‚Äôm switching!!
1240737162519351296 2020-03-19 16:29:25 EDT <Xfinity> We're working to fix this as soon as possible. Do you see a end time for this outage in your My Account app?
1240719739527331840 2020-03-19 15:20:12 EDT <JerseyJohn997> At least @Xfinity has something to blame their random outages on. It's got to be nice for them to have something more than their usual "cuz fuck you" excuse #CoronavirusOutbreak
1240718424625405952 2020-03-19 15:14:58 EDT <ZenVic33> Outage in Carmichael,Ca . Trying to work from home. Wtf?
1240718408766967808 2020-03-19 15:14:54 EDT <Mayseeohh> There‚Äôs been a WiFi outage EVERYDAY THIS WEEK smh @Xfinity  how am I supposed to work from home like this?
1240716863262396416 2020-03-19 15:08:46 EDT <Xfinity> Hi! Be sure to check your My Account app for info on outages.
1240715685170262016 2020-03-19 15:04:05 EDT <SmileSimplify> @Xfinity is there a internet service outage in San Francisco CA?
1240712091004092416 2020-03-19 14:49:48 EDT <MistressMaryJ> The app showed no outages anywhere around my area. It has reconnected as of a few minutes ago.
1240708835506974726 2020-03-19 14:36:52 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Gemma. We're working hard to keep you connected, but if you're in an area outage, keep an eye on your My Account app for updates.
1240704928764452865 2020-03-19 14:21:20 EDT <TheElizabethAna> Working from home and well once again can‚Äôt count on @Xfinity always an outage. #needtochangeproviders pic.twitter.com/LXQxDAGjHF
1240699130122395649 2020-03-19 13:58:18 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Jamir. Try to keep an eye on the My Account app for any outage updates and alerts. If you don't have the My Account app you can locate it here:  https://comca.st/3945wZO¬†.
1240697427197177857 2020-03-19 13:51:32 EDT <Damokieran> .@Xfinity internet is down. Your service outage maps say no outage in area. Account tools say problem detected with modem. Reset feature gave a 500 error. And can‚Äôt get anyone on the phone.  pic.twitter.com/ntkglVNm1I
1240695573478424576 2020-03-19 13:44:10 EDT <satanxty> Wow power came on oddly fast but now my fucking internet is having another fucking outage somehow you would fucking things 7 outages of it would make @Xfinity fucking actually fix the problem but I guess fucking not!
1240695385527431169 2020-03-19 13:43:25 EDT <CaptnSnark> @Xfinity outage count in my neighborhood this week: 7 Times!!!!! I know we are in end-times here, but can the internet at least be somewhat reliable?
1240693580219305990 2020-03-19 13:36:15 EDT <JxCOLE969> @Xfinity just had an outage by my house and my @verizon hotspot conveniently isn‚Äôt working today. Nice üò™
1240692886477238273 2020-03-19 13:33:29 EDT <barbyarusso> I‚Äôm stuck in an endless loop with @Xfinity on their chat. Automated responses don‚Äôt cope with my answers. The account is my husband‚Äôs, so I can‚Äôt sign in. You can‚Äôt even talk to them without signing in! Why aren‚Äôt service outage maps available publicly anymore?
1240691485428703233 2020-03-19 13:27:55 EDT <YancyFaith> @xfinity I need to report an outage. A truck tore the cable loose from the pole
1240691231941746688 2020-03-19 13:26:55 EDT <lizaanne> #outage #xfinity #comcast  TV signal is down - just wanted to watch the news.  Life is going to get very interesting for a lot of people if the service providers can't keep up with demand.
1240685876369219585 2020-03-19 13:05:38 EDT <forzamonica> This company is totally worthless. I can‚Äôt get in touch with any human being, have waited on the phone and follow every instruction. #outage #xfinity #comcast #CustomerService https://twitter.com/forzamonica/status/1240685338265149440¬†‚Ä¶
1240685338265149440 2020-03-19 13:03:30 EDT <forzamonica> @comcast @Xfinity i have been waiting 2 hours, reset my modem 5 times and no internet at all even though the #outage was ‚Äúfixed‚Äù an hour ago. What is the problem!?
1240684611291799557 2020-03-19 13:00:36 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Margo. Try to keep an eye on the My Account app for outage updates and alerts. If you don't have the My Account app you can locate it here:  https://comca.st/3bbBFAo¬†.
1240681309871185920 2020-03-19 12:47:29 EDT <jamalagnew> @Xfinity @comcast y‚Äôall stay with these damn outages! I‚Äôm getting ready to switch man I can‚Äôt take it anymore.
1240679394206789632 2020-03-19 12:39:52 EDT <Follow_Margo> Can someone tell @Xfinity that cable and internet are essential services this is the 3rd outage this week. How am I supposed to work from home or stay sane and informed like this?
1240678654344134657 2020-03-19 12:36:56 EDT <bubbly_gal> Oh YIPPEE, yet ANOTHER @Xfinity @comcast #outage in my ‚Äòhood. Allegedly ‚Äòupgraded‚Äô #fibernetwork recently yet MORE #outages since. #NoETA #unstable #notwork üôÑ. I need to chat with @ATT for a change.
1240675142277054464 2020-03-19 12:22:59 EDT <MInteriorsMarin> @Xfinity service outage going on 9 hours in 94925...
1240673629962199040 2020-03-19 12:16:58 EDT <eric_hontz> @Xfinity this is pretty horrible service - more than 500 outages in my zipcode...  pic.twitter.com/PvfydmAnFn
1240673123567128577 2020-03-19 12:14:57 EDT <GabrielaAmry> My mom works from home and hasn‚Äôt been able to work due to ‚Äúan outage‚Äù in our area (77022). It‚Äôs been 4 days! Our cellular WiFi restarted last week & we are already running out bc our xfinity WiFi is not working. She has 2 HS kids who have been home all week as well with no WiFi.
1240669992334561286 2020-03-19 12:02:31 EDT <ScarlettNinja3> There's an #xfinity outage in my area! Noooooo! #QuarantineLife #QuarantineLifeProblems
1240666307567198223 2020-03-19 11:47:52 EDT <mphslee> @Xfinity Once again horrible service. Everyday since last Thursday I have had WiFi outages (hours). Clearly you are working on something but in these times when everyone is trying to work from home our WiFi is critical. DO BETTER!!
1240661163240837120 2020-03-19 11:27:26 EDT <tracy_moore011> @comcastcares  - why can‚Äôt I stream on Xfinity?  Are you having an outage?
1240658110294917123 2020-03-19 11:15:18 EDT <jenrara> @Xfinity is there an outage in Brighton, MA?
1240656496595173377 2020-03-19 11:08:53 EDT <JDanso18> Xfinity would have an internet outage the day I have a shit ton to do at work. üôÉ
1240651559031255045 2020-03-19 10:49:16 EDT <pastamanican> Hey @Xfinity how long will the internet outages last in Charlottesville, va? Hell of a time for maintenance.
1240650368469663744 2020-03-19 10:44:32 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Samantha! First, let's have you check the Xfinity My Account app to see if there is an outage or maintenance going on in your area that's effecting your services.
1240643786059010055 2020-03-19 10:18:23 EDT <MattPenyuh> I‚Äôve had a @Xfinity power outage for a combined two days now. I‚Äôm so ticked. @comcast @comcastcares fix this!
1240641280406958080 2020-03-19 10:08:25 EDT <katlynadina> Soooooooo are @Xfinity outages because of ‚Äúmaintenance‚Äù going to be a daily occurance now?
1240640399951253506 2020-03-19 10:04:55 EDT <AngieAntici> Seriously, @comcast @Xfinity , an outage this morning in my neighborhood???? At a time when kids are remote learning and adults are working remotely?????  You have GOT to be kidding!
1240626440049168384 2020-03-19 09:09:27 EDT <Xfinity> Is there an estimated end time for this outage in your My Account app?
1240624581167198208 2020-03-19 09:02:04 EDT <Xfinity> Let's see what's going on. Have you been in an area outage during these times?
1240623763181449217 2020-03-19 08:58:49 EDT <Bri_Elyse1> It's been fixed now. I talked to a representative earlier about the outage in my area. But thank you!
1240517420198039554 2020-03-19 01:56:15 EDT <AMOAMS> Service outage, due to routine maintenance, when I have to from home? @comcastcares really? Flowood, MS
1240515489127940096 2020-03-19 01:48:34 EDT <_Frankie_Marie_> Of course we will have an @Xfinity outage right now this is bullshit
1240501047078146048 2020-03-19 00:51:11 EDT <italnanjl> @Xfinity i really hope out wifi outage is resolved by tomorrow. We have elearning to do ‚òπ my hotspot data won't be enough for 2 computers..i know you are woking hard. I thank you for that.
1240500799454629889 2020-03-19 00:50:12 EDT <satanxty> @Xfinity how many fucking outages am I gonna have in one day? Cause now this is four and this is fucking unacceptable
1240496210076676096 2020-03-19 00:31:58 EDT <natertots83> Just went down here not too long ago.  Seems to be going in and out a lot the past few months.   This is the weekly/bi-weekly outage for me.  Frustrating the heck out of me and support never offers to make it right.  I lose roughly 5-10 hours of internet per month.
1240490859193229312 2020-03-19 00:10:42 EDT <vlsampson> @Xfinity @comcast What is the status of the outage?! This is not the time for an outage!
1240486938584535046 2020-03-18 23:55:07 EDT <lesulloa> @comcastcares @Xfinity what I‚Äôm I supposed to do when my internet is out and I report an outage and you say there isn‚Äôt one? I have a line that is low hanging too and it‚Äôs not electrical
1240480066527608835 2020-03-18 23:27:49 EDT <TheCptnObvus> Service outage over here for 3+ hours already.... No TV and internet... Wonder how long it'll take @comcast @Xfinity to fix this outage
1240458157681336323 2020-03-18 22:00:46 EDT <_ihtzKati> Xfinity would have an outage right now üòë
1240449280743051264 2020-03-18 21:25:29 EDT <PradeepKathail> Worst time to be without internet. @comcast @Xfinity any update on Los Altos - Mountain View outage? Doesn‚Äôt show ETA
1240432891831648258 2020-03-18 20:20:22 EDT <stephnz> @Xfinity is it hooked up to a potato? Why do I even pay my bill for a four hour outage after spotty service all day when I have to work from home. This is garbage. Basura. Run me a check.  pic.twitter.com/a7voP6T0Hk
1240423716166631424 2020-03-18 19:43:54 EDT <whoscritty> xfinity had a outage or something yesterday so hopefully it‚Äôs fixed
1240415014659522560 2020-03-18 19:09:19 EDT <TenaciousMrD> Wonderful to know that when you need them the most (quarantined @ home, distance learning w students, no alternate internet options)... @Xfinity @comcast is there to disappoint you with an outage and an unclear fix time. Did my internet get #COVID„Éº19 ?  Hey @verizonfios, U up?
1240409367792553986 2020-03-18 18:46:53 EDT <TraceyBobitz> @comcast @Xfinity @comcastcares you say there‚Äôs no known outages in my area but no where on the app is there a place to report an outage. So how do you know there‚Äôs not an outage if customers can‚Äôt report it?
1240403131047043073 2020-03-18 18:22:06 EDT <ArmandoJUrias> @Xfinity @comcast another outage. Might as well be once every day.
1240396877855707137 2020-03-18 17:57:15 EDT <May_Alexis> If @Xfinity could CUT THE CRAP with the outages while the world is working from home that woulD BE NICE PLZ
1240395142827311105 2020-03-18 17:50:22 EDT <Krishna60820843> @Xfinity internet outage since morning in Mountain View has not been resolved! Why is your customer service so poor?
1240388734119563264 2020-03-18 17:24:54 EDT <kate_margolis> @Xfinity internet has been down all day (5 hours) due to local outage. We are all working from home and have nowhere else to go to access internet. You should make xfinitywifi pass free during this time.
1240374617619017729 2020-03-18 16:28:48 EDT <smoov22_sonic> I had an outage earlier today check your my account app

1240354498264158220 2020-03-18 15:08:51 EDT <SafaWarda1> They didn't offer and when I got thru they finally said it was an outage! Why didn't the online chat service know that? What is the point. Seriously something needs to be done about the service with #xfinity
1240352119305023489 2020-03-18 14:59:24 EDT <NYC2CAMonaco> Apparently! Your automated system says there is a power outage, but I have power. Can you tell me what the problem is?
1240344365425405954 2020-03-18 14:28:35 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Heather. If you're in an area outage, keep an eye on your My Account app for updates!
1240344359805091841 2020-03-18 14:28:34 EDT <Xfinity> We want to help. Are you in an area outage currently?

1240344154351243266 2020-03-18 14:27:45 EDT <Xfinity> What's going on with your Wi-Fi? Are you in an area outage?
1240340654057762816 2020-03-18 14:13:50 EDT <iamctodd> @Xfinity I'm suddenly out of service in Salem MA. Is there an outage?
1240339846759165954 2020-03-18 14:10:38 EDT <allchingona> @xfinity is there a large outage in the Houston area?
1240332530848579587 2020-03-18 13:41:34 EDT <Xfinity> Hi. Try to keep an eye on the My Account app for outage updates and alerts. If you don't have the My Account app you can locate it here:  https://comca.st/2wiaxRm¬†.
1240331905133936644 2020-03-18 13:39:05 EDT <MelissaIsArtsy> The lack of reliability with @xfinity should be enough to make anyone run quickly in literally any other direction. A little rain? Service outage. 2 degree temperature difference? Service outage. Need help? "We can send a tech that you have to pay for!" #FuckOff
1240330055965978625 2020-03-18 13:31:44 EDT <rhernandez227> @Xfinity total fail. I have a service outage and there is no way to report it. Phones and web site are both overwhelmed.  Phone tree prompts lead nowhere.  We have WOW available. I wonder how they are doing.
1240328504585191425 2020-03-18 13:25:34 EDT <Xfinity> If there is an outage going on, you can find details through the Xfinity My Account app. Unplugging the power chord always does the trick when I receive that screen. If you haven't done that yet, give it a try and then check the app.
1240328335621787648 2020-03-18 13:24:54 EDT <JD_thrice> Xfinity is messing the whole quarantine vibe up with this outage...
1240327787535372288 2020-03-18 13:22:43 EDT <nogve> @Xfinity why are you doing 4 maintenance rounds so far today? Everybody has work and this is disruptive. If it‚Äôs an outage due to high traffic just admit it...  pic.twitter.com/MSrdRLZB4L
1240327438078562305 2020-03-18 13:21:20 EDT <Xfinity> We can take a look. Are you seeing an outage showing in your My Account app?
1240321666347143170 2020-03-18 12:58:23 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Mae. Try to keep an eye on the My Account app for any outage updates and alerts. If you don't have the My Account app you can access it here:  https://comca.st/2UfS1AZ¬†.
1240320404318818305 2020-03-18 12:53:23 EDT <DynaTexas> @Xfinity this is the 6th hour of our outage?
1240317605010948096 2020-03-18 12:42:15 EDT <allchingona> Lol I‚Äôm working from hone and Xfinity reports an outage in my area! ü§£
1240317136876253184 2020-03-18 12:40:24 EDT <ashleyeicher> I was wondering if there was an outage yesterday. Tried to log into @comcast @Xfinity account to check outage areas but that wasn‚Äôt working either.
1240316800883195905 2020-03-18 12:39:03 EDT <jz2dc> @Xfinity help! I can not connect at all to a hot spot. Says no outage where I am, but close by outages. I am trying to work from home but can‚Äôt at all!
1240314596679876612 2020-03-18 12:30:18 EDT <theMaryNOmack> Day 2:  And there is an @Xfinity  internet outage  this morning üòï
1240311824597291010 2020-03-18 12:19:17 EDT <theroyalbadness> Whose with Xfinity? Are you experiencing a Wi-Fi outage?
1240310224571060224 2020-03-18 12:12:56 EDT <PhilMorehart> Absolutely lovely time for a service outage @Xfinity @comcast @comcastcares. Remind me again why I‚Äôm using you?
1240309828339355649 2020-03-18 12:11:21 EDT <Xfinity> Let's help. Are you able to see if you're in an area outage in your My Account app?
1240308184000147462 2020-03-18 12:04:49 EDT <SiSi_Simply> @Xfinity fix this outage now! Lol.. I need my services so I can catch up on shows during this quarantine dagnabit
1240306806397829121 2020-03-18 11:59:21 EDT <courtste04> @comcastcares Can‚Äôt seem to log into my email or open the Xfinity app to check for outages.  Messages says the server is down.
1240306011736608768 2020-03-18 11:56:11 EDT <MelissaIsArtsy> Nothing but outages and bullshit excuses from @xfinity and @comcast 100% of the time. You realize this means I can lose my job, right?
1240299420954103808 2020-03-18 11:30:00 EDT <dnice1101> @Xfinity @comcastcares @comcast wow just heard they are giving free internet to people during this difficult. How bout the customer that is paying for it????  Guess there will be outages all day when I‚Äôm trying to work!!!!!!!!!
1240296209459351552 2020-03-18 11:17:14 EDT <abhi15hunk> @Xfinity @comcastcares Day 3 with a outage again..comcast making life very harder..you guys really suck at providing service. You guys working very hard to disconnect America not connect. Shame on you guys....
1240260364035674112 2020-03-18 08:54:48 EDT <Xfinity> Are you in an area outage?
1240258156858675200 2020-03-18 08:46:02 EDT <nlpatel> @Xfinity @comcast outage from yesterday. Not stable connection. Long wait time and monopoly in area. Sucks.
1240250386012872708 2020-03-18 08:15:09 EDT <Xfinity> What's going on with your TV, Priscilla? Are you in an area outage?
1240246130602016769 2020-03-18 07:58:14 EDT <SchottRachel> @Xfinity @comcast you have an internet outage (nearing 16 hours now) in Cambridge, MA near Porter Square that‚Äôs not being recognized on your outage map. With so many people WFH, we are relying on WiFi! when can we expect a communication or recognition that you are working on it?
1240237223859101697 2020-03-18 07:22:51 EDT <fuckelas7ic> It's been almost over a day now and @Xfinity still has a outage. Smh I got work to do and this is unacceptable.
1240223329841266688 2020-03-18 06:27:38 EDT <soshields> Wow @Xfinity , with thousands stuck at home you sure picked a great time for an outage!! #xfinitysucks
1240182785903603712 2020-03-18 03:46:32 EDT <NothingBut_Shae> Of course Xfinity has an outage at the wrong time üôÑ
1240158231235686400 2020-03-18 02:08:58 EDT <satanxty> Well my @Xfinity has been in a outage for like. Six hours, that's cool I guess I won't have a nice time once I got power back that's cool
1240144792438353923 2020-03-18 01:15:33 EDT <ValorAndMuscle> @Xfinity you plan on fixing the outage in southeast Michigan anytime soon? Have work that needs to be done.
1240137793063567360 2020-03-18 00:47:45 EDT <TheDeeNicole> Apparently we‚Äôre having an internet outage in my neighborhood right now. I‚Äôm going to need for Xfinity to figure this shit out before we‚Äôre completely under curfew because this simply will not do.
1240098217200693248 2020-03-17 22:10:29 EDT <crtalb001> I would just appreciate the internet not going down multiple times a day. My sister works from home (not just for the quarantine) and she could get fired because it keeps going down. She gets written up every time it crashes and there is not a documented outage.
1240089241280868352 2020-03-17 21:34:49 EDT <Rpigatti> @Xfinity I have lost my internet connection for 2h new. Tried restarting and even reseting the modem but with no success, despite the fact that there is no outage report in my area.    Also, I got errors while scheduling a call with support. Running out of options. Can you help?
1240089210851336193 2020-03-17 21:34:42 EDT <JosephPNoel> My area picked a really good time to have an @Xfinity internet outage, slow service problem....
1240083107367321600 2020-03-17 21:10:27 EDT <Missm1andonly> Sooooo @Xfinity is not holding up to what they told their customers...they‚Äôre trying to make my sister pay her bill (she is out of work) when she was calling about an outage and she has a child that needs the internet to do her school work!
1240067133070958593 2020-03-17 20:06:58 EDT <meowmurlyn> Now there‚Äôs an xfinity power outage. What‚Äôs next!!!  pic.twitter.com/jYMnv7kzjP
1240064975814758402 2020-03-17 19:58:24 EDT <Marcusssss9> I can't connect my internet either, been going on for the past 4 hours, have you spoke with someone from @Xfinity ,is there an outage problem everywhere or is it just my internet not connecting?
1240060093632114688 2020-03-17 19:39:00 EDT <RebeccaWen4> Hi this is the second outage I have experienced today!!! I‚Äôm not able to wfh due to this ‚Äî‚Äî can‚Äôt believe this is happening.
1240054273209032704 2020-03-17 19:15:52 EDT <mindmotion> I'm in lower pac heights area and there was a 10min outage around 2pm today.  Last week has been sluggish overall for me.
1240041796882882577 2020-03-17 18:26:17 EDT <Shiggity1> @comcastcares @comcast @Xfinity I just tweeted you to report that my internet service wasn't running properly. I just reset all my networking equipment and my modem and all is well for the moment. Are you experiencing/dealing with any COVID-19 related outages in Boston, MA area??
1240040648335638528 2020-03-17 18:21:44 EDT <Blizzy_OnDaYARD> @Xfinity y‚Äôall really have an outage in my area or y‚Äôall just don‚Äôt want me to snap on a rep?? ü§î
1240040139763712006 2020-03-17 18:19:42 EDT <findingharmony1> Did u get it back on they said major outage in this area should be back on by 330pm if yours isn't back on yet id call them again !
1240039665924812800 2020-03-17 18:17:49 EDT <_MarcusD3_> Same here. All streaming options via web, no matter what browser used not working. Streaming app won't load. Xfinity app for account information and checking for outages won't load. Going to xfinity forums to check on others reporting issues won't load when trying to login.
1240038898656518146 2020-03-17 18:14:46 EDT <abhi15hunk> Thanks for the reply but looks like you guys working every day with outage....and this is very frustrating as my job is completely reliable on internet. And we cant go out due to shutdown we rely on you guys...hoping you guys understand.but my area I see lot of outages everyday.
1240038689574727684 2020-03-17 18:13:57 EDT <JayTerryy> Same things with me but be happy you‚Äôre not getting ‚Äúunplanned outage‚Äù that last 3 days
1240035448556142593 2020-03-17 18:01:04 EDT <X0AmandaNicole> Or at least prorate my acct up to the 16th. I would not have changed my mobile plan if your home internet was not down. I‚Äôm essentially paying $45 for 6 days of internet data because of the outage. I‚Äôm happy with the 1 gig plan & don‚Äôt need more than that w/ home internet.
1240022629312061440 2020-03-17 17:10:07 EDT <Mapd4Y> Love how these outages always affect them same locations. Xfinity today.  pic.twitter.com/jmtd8BeJ4C

1240016279303532544 2020-03-17 16:44:54 EDT <Vic_Ki_Secrets> It‚Äôs been 2 outages today in my area with Xfinity & I‚Äôm working from home so this can‚Äôt be happening!!! ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

1240008781691576321 2020-03-17 16:15:06 EDT <britneyIRL> Amid all this craziness, @Xfinity is telling me we have a neighborhood internet outage. First it was expected to be resolved at 3:01PM CT and now the website has updated to ‚Äúas soon as possible.‚Äù Y‚Äôall know people like myself are working from home for the next 15 days right? üò°
1240006827879870473 2020-03-17 16:07:20 EDT <choklit_chic> I have for two days straight. Just says outage one day and today it says unavailable.

1239697249464209414 2020-03-16 19:37:11 EDT <MissAnderson_28> This is the beginning of social distancing and @xfinity wanna have an outage? üòë
1239693702035103746 2020-03-16 19:23:05 EDT <theCRISTYshow> Now it‚Äôs a freaking outage with Xfinity! üò° They have the most outages!!
1239657210386448391 2020-03-16 16:58:05 EDT <ajpearlescent> @Xfinity I work from home and my husband is now mandated to work from home- internet outage ALL day today in #pa with no explanation.
1239634385332252673 2020-03-16 15:27:23 EDT <puj_sixfourteen> Cmon @Xfinity get it together! You all had to know a large amount of people would be working from home today! These network outages are irresponsible.
1239632218923905033 2020-03-16 15:18:46 EDT <Gemthemaverick> Bum ass Xfinity decided to have an outage right now on all services.
1239628490523189249 2020-03-16 15:03:57 EDT <hillea> It says there are not outages. My cable is working but none of my streaming services are working and they‚Äôre saying I‚Äôm not connected to the internet.
1239627641784881154 2020-03-16 15:00:35 EDT <Xfinity> Yes. Ok, do you have the Xfinity My Account app installed? You can check if there is an outage in your area or if maintenance is going on and has interrupted your services temporarily.
1239626690290212864 2020-03-16 14:56:48 EDT <Xfinity> Are you in an area outage?
1239621588544258048 2020-03-16 14:36:32 EDT <Xfinity> Hi, do you know if you are in an area wide outage or are you having issues specific to your own service?
1239619790785761283 2020-03-16 14:29:23 EDT <Rex> Xfinity outage in Oakland? I'm still connected but barely, getting around 10Mbps maximum download speed right now. Latency hovering around 400ms
1239613268525793280 2020-03-16 14:03:28 EDT <Marisa_Ingemi> Allston? There‚Äôs an xfinity outage here
1239609307353829377 2020-03-16 13:47:44 EDT <Xfinity> Hey. If you're in an area outage, keep an eye on your My Account app for updates.

1239592964499767296 2020-03-16 12:42:47 EDT <BullfrogTv> @Xfinity is having intermittent internet outages in southern Colorado
1239588853188608000 2020-03-16 12:26:27 EDT <DKnightIngram> Thankful I have my @verizon hotspot as a backup because @Xfinity has been having ‚Äúunplanned outages‚Äù in my area the past couple of days. #WFH #WorkFromHome #StayHome #FlattenTheCurve
1239578275745275905 2020-03-16 11:44:25 EDT <Xfinity> What's going on with your service? Are you in an area outage?
1239577128829665281 2020-03-16 11:39:52 EDT <SomeGuyInHTown> So there‚Äôs an XFinity outage in my area. I guess there‚Äôs our answer to if they can handle everyone working from home...
1239576843470213120 2020-03-16 11:38:44 EDT <Baba_Roots_> Of course Xfinity would have an outage  pic.twitter.com/4mmhb2gdEh
1239576048607559687 2020-03-16 11:35:34 EDT <ItsKittyBabee> @Xfinity @comcast u picked a fine time to have an outage. I am stuck in the house trying to work remote. This is unacceptable and needs to be resolved NOW
1239568675721678850 2020-03-16 11:06:17 EDT <shmex_> @comcast @Xfinity the end date/time of this outage due to the tornado has been moved continuously. we need to work. it‚Äôs been 2 weeks.
1239568588895326208 2020-03-16 11:05:56 EDT <cindypaladines> The outage continues! The resolution time keeps getting pushed back
1239556598453788672 2020-03-16 10:18:17 EDT <ZachRoth> I doesn‚Äôt say I have an outage at my location, but the internet cuts out every 5 minutes. All the areas around me seem to be having issues This was happening last week during the day as well.
1239556296564789249 2020-03-16 10:17:05 EDT <Xfinity> Hey Zach. If you're experiencing an area outage, keep an eye on your My Account app for updates.
1239553064362815489 2020-03-16 10:04:14 EDT <Xfinity> Any known outage info can be found through the Xfinity My Account app or by visiting:  https://comca.st/2w2qM57¬†.
1239552756303695872 2020-03-16 10:03:01 EDT <lydiathom93> Yes of course! Are there outages in DC? Completely out since last night
1239520205115731968 2020-03-16 07:53:40 EDT <Soulpowr> @GetSpectrum @Xfinity @comcastcares @CoxComm @FrontierCorp @MediacomCable @ATT @dish should customers expect cellphone internet and cabletv outages in the upcoming weeks? What are your emergency/disaster plans?
1239505331597783041 2020-03-16 06:54:34 EDT <DPrice12083> AMAZING. So glad your customers who already pay WAY TO MUCH are without internet due to an outage üò°
1239505055650402305 2020-03-16 06:53:28 EDT <DPrice12083> @Xfinity now is NOT the time for an internet outage ! Can you PLEASE get it together as we are all now expected to work remotely from home. We are already stressed enough üò°
1239447607581134850 2020-03-16 03:05:12 EDT <g_2_m_2> Thanks @Xfinity. Currently going on 4 hours with an outage. Worst service ever for the overpriced bill we already pay in the heart of Silicon Valley!
1239439358995857409 2020-03-16 02:32:25 EDT <queenbsoprano> Y‚Äôall, we are basically stuck at home for the next few weeks and NOW is when Xfinity has an internet outage. COME ON.
1239439316264398848 2020-03-16 02:32:15 EDT <BoobiemilesXX4> @Xfinity outage? What a wonderful time for this crap
1239426857394737154 2020-03-16 01:42:44 EDT <melaniegcm> There's an Xfinity outage in my area. Can you NOT !
1239417171727376384 2020-03-16 01:04:15 EDT <sachafaust> Nice timing for internet outage! @Xfinity  pic.twitter.com/AJJccLhmgs
1239346992360325123 2020-03-15 20:25:23 EDT <emmonsaggie> Just wait for the constant outages... We have X at the office. Weekly issues.
1239312865636556802 2020-03-15 18:09:47 EDT <jonclarkpond> Funny, there are now 3 @comcast @Xfinity vehicles outside my building, but their app still says there are no outages, but also, that it can‚Äôt communicate with my modem. üßê
1239304905241710592 2020-03-15 17:38:09 EDT <arcadewildfire> welp, @Xfinity went all ‚Äúhold my beer‚Äù with an internet outage in my area.
1239298176055566336 2020-03-15 17:11:24 EDT <Dave_Twistle> @Xfinity @comcast just got a text from you about planned internet outages in Seattle. Our hospital emergency rooms are overflowing with sick patient(s), and patients are being sent home to be monitored remotely by staff at the hospitals. You should not be doing maintenance here.
1239281723197788163 2020-03-15 16:06:02 EDT <9Moyle> @Xfinity an outage while #SocialDistancing is not as much fun as you‚Äôd think. I can‚Äôt use my iPad üò°#COVID„Éº19
1239264594515890176 2020-03-15 14:57:58 EDT <metalprof> 6 hour outage even though the "outage map" in the Xfinity app kept telling me there were no outages at my location the whole time ... and the app has no means to report an outage.
1239254856923328512 2020-03-15 14:19:16 EDT <carl_luecke> I was just thinking about this:  which is harder?  Self-isolating for a few weeks or withstanding an internet outage for three weeks. Both, impossible!
1239245912020520962 2020-03-15 13:43:44 EDT <pithynickname> Last thing we need right now is internet outages while everyone is stuck at home and possibly the most important political debate of our lives is happening tonight... :/
1239245698127876097 2020-03-15 13:42:53 EDT <AM631099> Why don‚Äôt you take care of the paying customers first and reduce the number of outages?
1239245486722252801 2020-03-15 13:42:02 EDT <AM631099> #Xfinity charges a late fee if you‚Äôre a day late on your bill, but often has outages with no compensation. #Chicago #choices @Xfinity #comcastoutage #chicagoIL #wifi #streaming
1239232967706316800 2020-03-15 12:52:17 EDT <JCraigy3_> @Xfinity I despise ur company for its constant outages and fuckery.
1239223890796261376 2020-03-15 12:16:13 EDT <imdregreen> Just when I thought life could get no worse, there‚Äôs a WiFi outage. @Xfinity horrible timing. Thanks.
1239223198736056320 2020-03-15 12:13:28 EDT <SingingMiniVan> @Xfinity outage in Columbia, MD. HELP A SISTER OUT ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1239218815491280897 2020-03-15 11:56:03 EDT <wendymink> @Xfinity Why so many outages?  4x in three days.
1239217208582119427 2020-03-15 11:49:40 EDT <ArmandoJUrias> @Xfinity In Houston you‚Äôve had at least 5 outages in the past month. Your customer service needs to improve. For those that work from home, this is even more unacceptable. Been a customer for 5 years, but I will be canceling now.
1239066847988912129 2020-03-15 01:52:11 EDT <jaydiebadass> @Xfinity needs to give out discounts for when they have outagesüò§
1239031626954203136 2020-03-14 23:32:14 EDT <SJenks352> Ah, and there close my google docs I was working on for class. Thanks @Xfinity for another evening of wifi outages. Will Steve manage his assignments on time? Stay tuned!
1239017704356556800 2020-03-14 22:36:55 EDT <CandaceT23> Xfinity charge too much damn money to be having outages
1238966542186020865 2020-03-14 19:13:37 EDT <ckelly1412> @Xfinity WiFi would have another outage in my area during coronavirus weekend. No streaming for us...great timing.
1238962034693136384 2020-03-14 18:55:42 EDT <shannonsparkles> @comcastcares I've even gone to the local xfinity store and picked up a new cablecard, but activating online isn't working and I can't reach anyone on the phone due to this phantom outage that I can't get any info on from your web site either.
1238949557800767490 2020-03-14 18:06:07 EDT <TheMotoMitch> Internet has dropped dramatically, outages around the area.   Stream will be back soon! Thank you MEDICATED420 for the #Ember Drops!!! üíöüî• Shout out to you supporting the MotoFamilyGarage! @comcastcares @Xfinity @comcast please help!   #mixer #streamer #gamer
1238949392981192704 2020-03-14 18:05:28 EDT <pussyassmoron> Worst case scenario it went out like 2-3 times a month for hours at a time. Best case like once a month/every other month. This was consistent in the 10 years my family used xfinity in 3 different houses. I‚Äôve used 2 different isp since then n I get outages like twice a year lol
1238947944524435456 2020-03-14 17:59:43 EDT <pussyassmoron> Got 120 mb from xfinity for a good price. Just be prepared for outages at least once a month lmao
1238914398254772224 2020-03-14 15:46:25 EDT <codonnell518> @comcastcares @Xfinity When can we expect service to be restored in East Nashville? Your outage map keeps claiming issue will be resolved in another 12 hours.  #xfinity #comcastoutage #eastnashville #help #please #itsbeendays
1238910879099469825 2020-03-14 15:32:26 EDT <dimplesamor_> I'm going to have to switch to At&t because Xfinity and these outages are really ridiculous
1238900751860203520 2020-03-14 14:52:11 EDT <CJ_Gerardi> So was told yesterday I have to work from home for 2 weeks and today @Xfinity is experiencing an outage in my area.  I know this is not as important as other things going on but kind of hard to quarantine if I can‚Äôt work from home.
1238847954334736387 2020-03-14 11:22:23 EDT <713AstrosFan> So long as internet still working, I‚Äôm keeping my cool. Once Xfinity gives me an outage, I‚Äôll go bonkers. üòÇ
1238843274170961921 2020-03-14 11:03:47 EDT <DevoALMIGHTY> @Xfinity please get your shit together. Daily outages and a $300 bill... like come on. The same morning (within my contract i might add) my bill jumps nearly $50 I have yet ANOTHER outage. We are social distancing ain‚Äôt nobody got time for that!! I know I‚Äôm about to pull da plug.
1238839630566432768 2020-03-14 10:49:19 EDT <cbetz75> How about not having outages? That would be an awesome idea
1238772007640150017 2020-03-14 06:20:36 EDT <Ali_SyedRaza> @Xfinity hey, when is the outage getting restored in the area 71104. It has been over a day now and is getting ridiculous. thank you.
1238756893289377794 2020-03-14 05:20:33 EDT <LuckyLuciano430> I sure hope so considering I got an email from xfinity regarding their attempts to ensure no coverage outages during this time of crisis.
1238700113947549697 2020-03-14 01:34:55 EDT <dxpert1019> @Xfinity  this is the wrong time to be having outages. Your service is always down in South San Jose.
1238643854947094528 2020-03-13 21:51:22 EDT <FrostiOrcaVA> Haven't had internet in 2 weeks now, hope #xfinity solves the outage in My area soon, Makes it hard to work  (Don't rant about xfinity please, Nashville was hit by a tornado last week)
1238641638722793474 2020-03-13 21:42:34 EDT <LRP01560943> @Xfinity @comcastcares Literally got this email in the middle of a service outage. I appreciate your efforts, but the timing was hilariously bad.  pic.twitter.com/JvSmvyhCe2

1238618007213166593 2020-03-13 20:08:39 EDT <itsGRXG> there was an xfinity outage in my area ;-; stream will be back up asap
1238600753972940800 2020-03-13 19:00:06 EDT <andrewbecks> .@comcast, @Xfinity: For the past 2 days, the outage time being reported for my internet service keeps incrementing. Can you share any news or updates? I'm in tornado-impacted Nashville (ZIP 37206-1529), and stuck in a coronavirus quarantine. Internet access is critically needed.  pic.twitter.com/W6OhlErjzp

1238557264446984193 2020-03-13 16:07:17 EDT <Xfinity> Does your My Account app indicate that you're in an area outage?
1238555418932187140 2020-03-13 15:59:57 EDT <Xfinity> Hi. Are you having area outages or is there an issue with your equipment not staying connected?
1238548751037247488 2020-03-13 15:33:28 EDT <brennadactyl> Totally, and I'm sure you are all doing the best you can.  I've had ongoing issues with this provider for MONTHS. Outages, constant drops. Paying for 1k down and getting 10. :/
1238546172345749510 2020-03-13 15:23:13 EDT <Amy_Rosenow> Nothing like a good @Xfinity internet outage to cap off day 2 of ‚Äúwork and school from home for weeks‚Äù. Oy!!!
1238536434711252993 2020-03-13 14:44:31 EDT <JerrySinDWZ> An internet outage in southeast Michigan(Thanks Xfinity üòë) kept me from doing the show.

1238501381608177667 2020-03-13 12:25:14 EDT <Giras0ul> @Xfinity finna cut me a check for making me use ALL my data for work. Sick of these outages.

1238394909553496065 2020-03-13 05:22:09 EDT <angenola> Hi Joe...‚Ä¶...One thought.  We have Comcast, Xfinity, whatever they call it now.   We get many outages.....sometimes a full day.   And that's on a good day.

And if your power goes off, or there is a outage your alarm system doesn‚Äôt not work if there is no internet.

1238324995576791041 2020-03-13 00:44:20 EDT <americatheugly1> Hey @comcast @comcastcares @Xfinity @NBCcomcast,  When you cannot see any States east of the Mississippi because of the outages on your outage map, that is a problem. The fact that the previous fact is a common occurrence is an absolute disaster!  #comcastoutage #ComcastSucks pic.twitter.com/nY7nSsTWvR
1238288164818694144 2020-03-12 22:17:59 EDT <v_green22> @Xfinity please do something about these outages in Michigan that seem to happen every month this is ridiculous give us a credit or something here. It‚Äôs the Stone Age when we can‚Äôt watch tv or be on the internet
1238272941403574277 2020-03-12 21:17:29 EDT <RCB_FGC> Welp nevermind. Outage in my area. Again. Hey @Xfinity this is like the 5 time in two weeks internet has been down in my area. I better get a credit for all of this especially since I pay for your gig service.  https://twitter.com/RCB_FGC/status/1238271390576529408¬†‚Ä¶
1238239317954310146 2020-03-12 19:03:53 EDT <Xfinity> The  My Account app is the best way to keep track of the outages and get updates on your service.
1238235628757831681 2020-03-12 18:49:13 EDT <Xfinity> When the internet goes out is it due to an area-wide outage?
1238235459664273408 2020-03-12 18:48:33 EDT <judpom> 4th internet outage today, here in Santa Clara, CA. Xfinity is not facilitating WFH  @comcastcares @Xfinity
1238228650350149632 2020-03-12 18:21:30 EDT <Di_Ku> Indeed. In the past @Xfinity has given reasons for complaints (unwarranted charges, online help for ISP outage) but so far they have handled the extra load remarkably well with graceful degradation (e.g. turn off Zoom video). Compliments & fingers crossed.
1238217226978820096 2020-03-12 17:36:06 EDT <Conroy1021> @Xfinity my internet is out and my app says there an outage... When do you think internet will be restored?
1238196961494192128 2020-03-12 16:15:34 EDT <mattbtoday> @comcastcares @Xfinity another hours long outage in Seattle, that's two in a week. Thousands of people are forced to work from home and relying on you. Please get it fixed!
1238196042518183940 2020-03-12 16:11:55 EDT <DerfelMacGuffin> Of course this shitastic day had to include an Xfinity power outage.  pic.twitter.com/uxFP6tSpqN
1238194948698189826 2020-03-12 16:07:34 EDT <JohnRManzo> Bad timing, @comcast/@Xfinity/@comcastcares. I am bunkered to my studio apartment without access to NBA, NHL, March Madness and people, so you do me dirty and have a Chicago power outage? Can't even let me #HUT on @EASPORTSNHL. ü§î This ain't right. #SMH #COVID19 pic.twitter.com/lwxBLWhiSd
1238193642608754690 2020-03-12 16:02:23 EDT <mattsm00th> Another Xfinity outage ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1238187495214460929 2020-03-12 15:37:57 EDT <isthatkimmi> does xfinity have an outage every month?
1238178043971227648 2020-03-12 15:00:24 EDT <SamuelCish> Over the past 2 weeks I've experienced more outages than in the past year, what's going on Xfinity?
1238169767997046786 2020-03-12 14:27:31 EDT <messiah_Jay8890> @Xfinity y‚Äôall are ridiculous another outage kneeling damn well people are teleworking during the virus outbreak! Screw your guys and fuck your lack of empathy
1238159693853462536 2020-03-12 13:47:29 EDT <tylerremmel> What a wonderful day for an @Xfinity outage
1238148149505658881 2020-03-12 13:01:37 EDT <PotatoPupp> I live in Chicago suburbs and Xfinity is the best we have here. There are such frequent outages though... (late at night or midday) might be bad for a steamer if you live near a wildlife area like me. Idk what else would be causing outages so often lol
1238108337578934273 2020-03-12 10:23:25 EDT <comcast> Have you looked in the Xfinity My Account app to see if there was any maintenance or outages happening in your area? -Gabbie
1238100891561050113 2020-03-12 09:53:50 EDT <Xfinity> Hey Joe. First, I'd check the Xfinity My Account app to see if there is any maintenance being done in the area or if there is a known outage that's being worked on. Second, I'd try restarting the gateway. Let me know if you need further help!
1238083142902329344 2020-03-12 08:43:18 EDT <LFieldPenticuff> It just says there‚Äôs an outage until 11:32. I called and spoke to someone in retention who said it‚Äôs something that happens every three months while upgrading/repairing lines. It would just be more helpful if it wasn‚Äôt during work hours üëéüèª
1238078357755084807 2020-03-12 08:24:17 EDT <LFieldPenticuff> @Xfinity I‚Äôm going to need you to stop having outages during the workday so my husband can do his job. Please repair lines in the middle of the night so people can do their jobs. Or at least figure out a better way to communicate outages. Not cool after we just switched services.
1238076079618887688 2020-03-12 08:15:14 EDT <juliammccarthy> Yasss @Xfinity thanks for having a WiFi outage my first day of mandatory wfh!!!!!!!!!!
1238060416493813761 2020-03-12 07:12:59 EDT <metro_man> Us: Telework! @Xfinity: here‚Äôs a convenient outage for you! No cable, no internet. üòê  pic.twitter.com/FxCGfwYN4K
1238021685011304448 2020-03-12 04:39:05 EDT <IamTonyTequila> Is there an @Xfinity outage or just me and my phone?   @comcastcares ?
1238015740256583680 2020-03-12 04:15:28 EDT <pinkcars> @Xfinity several hours without internet and not even an estimated time on when it'll be up or the cause of the outage. Over $200 a month and I don't know a thing about what's going on. Awesome.
1238012404316815360 2020-03-12 04:02:13 EDT <sdakuri> @Xfinity so you guys don‚Äôt have the decency to update customers about scheduled outages, lasting ~ 6 hours and to make matters worse, you offer a compensation of <50 cents, while I am losing work hours and $$.
1237990908391497729 2020-03-12 02:36:47 EDT <tim_stotz> My internet is out because it must be a day that ends in Y, and I‚Äôm checking @Xfinity and yes, they are having outages, and yes they increased my bill by $40 without telling me because yes they are the worst.  But they‚Äôre a monopoly. So no way they‚Äôll try to make this right.
1237985084357193730 2020-03-12 02:13:39 EDT <Benjamin_sdw05> @Xfinity can you fix the outage?
1237968024189063168 2020-03-12 01:05:51 EDT <idkmeowmeow> I'm pretty sure @comcast  is punishing me for cancelling my cable with an internet outage in my area.  @comcastcares #XFINITY #comcastoutage pic.twitter.com/0Ehup7QtQS

1237825360064020482 2020-03-11 15:38:58 EDT <MaidenFan663> Ah, fair enough. I have Xfinity and get outages pretty frequently.
1237821313257025536 2020-03-11 15:22:53 EDT <Timinole> Hey @comcastcares, why does my internet keep going out while the xfinity app says there‚Äôs not an outage at my address?
1237791397576572929 2020-03-11 13:24:00 EDT <Mariana_Fusco12> It won‚Äôt work for me. Do you know if I‚Äôm in the area of an outage? Hammond, Indiana
1237791009905545217 2020-03-11 13:22:28 EDT <Xfinity> Hey. Check your My Account app to see if you're in an area outage.

1237747270495469571 2020-03-11 10:28:40 EDT <Xfinity> Are they are outages or is it just your service?
1237727247387242497 2020-03-11 09:09:06 EDT <Xfinity> Hi there. Sorry to hear this. Keep an eye on your My Account app for updates on the outage; we can also take a look at why they're so frequent. Use this link -  https://xfin.tv/support¬† - to DM us.
1237721784784490496 2020-03-11 08:47:23 EDT <MrSlowsky> @Xfinity @comcastcares why has my internet continued to have outages?  Working from home is becoming especially difficult.  Maybe time to switch to Att
1237628252354576384 2020-03-11 02:35:44 EDT <DNDigital> I am SO sorry everyone that was in my stream. We randomly had an outage with my ISP and everything was disconnected. I am trying to get back up and running but Xfinity is saying the outage is going to last a while and I don't know how long that will be ;-;
1237609113527304195 2020-03-11 01:19:40 EDT <SouthpawSwade> I get the time and motivation to set up my web store and work on my website and BOOM xfinity outage. It‚Äôs lit!!!  pic.twitter.com/3RF6ZH8vfs

1237597397158522881 2020-03-11 00:33:07 EDT <Jason_n_Pardise> @Xfinity is there a internet outage at in Miami Lakes!?
1237576523869114369 2020-03-10 23:10:11 EDT <HangmanSwingset> I love how @Xfinity always has an "issue" when I try to disable the public xfinitywifi access point. Most of your customers don't want this, it causes regular outages and hiccups in service, and unnecessary interference with other wireless devices.
1237574244155813888 2020-03-10 23:01:07 EDT <LinziKIRO7> Hi @comcast @Xfinity is this true? Should thousands of people through our region expect outages while they‚Äôre trying to work from home during this #CoronavirusOutbreak ? If so what areas are affected & how long?

1237299735209431040 2020-03-10 04:50:19 EDT <pimpdezz> Why Xfinity have a whole outage this morning

1237203169593049088 2020-03-09 22:26:36 EDT <MyRightWingSide> So @xfinity has decided to install fiber in Seattle in the middle of the coronivirus epidemic, and cause outages when people must to work from home, kids are tele-schooling, and we've been told to maintain social distance & can't go to hotspots to telecommute.  Thanks, @Comcast!
1237196088194379778 2020-03-09 21:58:28 EDT <WineDoctors> Is there an @Xfinity cable outage in 94025?

1237152989514792960 2020-03-09 19:07:12 EDT <AntiS0cialWrkr> Why is @Xfinity customer service so bad? No internet all day and their online help is glitchy and just keeps saying over and over there‚Äôs an outage. Brilliant update.   Yes, this is a first world problem, but it‚Äôs also important so my husband can work. @comcast @comcastcares
1237126307734904833 2020-03-09 17:21:11 EDT <ShaneDeMill> What is going on with @Xfinity and the internet outages? We have had multiple outages over the last few days. It has been terrible! It makes it impossible to work from home.
1237123918298783744 2020-03-09 17:11:41 EDT <Xfinity> For planned outages and scheduled maintenance customers will be notified up to 3 days prior through the Xfinity My Account app.
1237123704326324226 2020-03-09 17:10:50 EDT <TomBradysSon2> Outage in the area code 23114...?

1237077278695337984 2020-03-09 14:06:21 EDT <AlBurley> @comcastcares @Xfinity when are you going to keep your promises? You said our service would had already been restored as this outage is a Vomcast Owned and Caused Outage! Expecting a call and not received it! Where is the customer service promised?
1237016297591812096 2020-03-09 10:04:02 EDT <natezimmer> @comcastcares Our cable is out in 98661, and yet no outages are indicated on the Xfinity app. Please fix it.
1237009294589132800 2020-03-09 09:36:13 EDT <chipocrite> @Xfinity I see some other people tweeting about having trouble using the Xfinity Streaming app/channel on their @Roku devices.. I haven't been able to use it myself for almost a week now. Is this a complete outage or is there something I can do to fix it? Thanks!
1236876287039303680 2020-03-09 00:47:41 EDT <LosGato06042538> @Xfinity I hope you realize most people are working from home this week due to coronavirus. The San Jose/ Los Gatos outage was supposed to be fixed by 9:30 pm today and we still don‚Äôt have internet.
1236842061095211008 2020-03-08 22:31:41 EDT <Statsman80> @MediacomCable wow more outages again with no storms or bad weather in site...I really miss @Xfinity

1236347552037064709 2020-03-07 12:46:41 EDT <g______> @Xfinity I‚Äôve had an outage every day this week. What is going on? Agents not taking calls and chat non-response was useless.  Claiming you fixed the issue only for internet svc to be down again an hour later is not fixing the issue.

1236127483881234432 2020-03-06 22:12:12 EDT <HoosierEm> @Xfinity This is the second four+ hour outage in Clear Lake Shores, TX today.  This is ridiculous.  I pay you $200+ per month and I can‚Äôt watch TV on a Friday night?  Good Lord.  @comcastcares #comcastdoesntcare
1236068686349438976 2020-03-06 18:18:34 EDT <Xfinity> We can credit you due to this outage. Send us a DM here:  https://xfin.tv/support¬†
1236067916061323266 2020-03-06 18:15:30 EDT <ThaQueenFee> This happens at least one FRIDAY a month. This is the first time I‚Äôm seeing an outage report without an estimated resolution time. That can‚Äôt be good. @Xfinity give me my credit üò§  pic.twitter.com/dYQd9rKpTp
1236062824075612161 2020-03-06 17:55:16 EDT <Apraxif> Hey @xfinity I really LOVE how you guys are fucking me over. 3 + Techs over a year for outages and still no compensation besides 25$ fucking dollars. Thank god I'm switching providers.
1236005201158574081 2020-03-06 14:06:18 EDT <NJTxPyrCommuter> Hey @Xfinity what is going on with your internet service in Woodbridge, NJ? There have been MULTIPLE service outages in the area this week, including again today.
1235963054929539073 2020-03-06 11:18:50 EDT <cdnahill> Companies saying WFH if you can in Seattle area. @Xfinity outage in Kirkland making that not possible. #ParForTheCourse
1235925826022961152 2020-03-06 08:50:53 EDT <bakerjjj> @Xfinity outage taking place. Status back up in hours.... post work start time, so what gives? Some of us are needing to work from home these days... am I getting credit for the outages? #xfinity #coronavirus
1235924645704077314 2020-03-06 08:46:12 EDT <JaySaysStuff> There was an outage but you apparently just fixed it. Thanks!
1235924252026695682 2020-03-06 08:44:38 EDT <ortegar5> @Xfinity seriously!? Another outage? Second time this week. Definitely cancelling.
1235923474939555842 2020-03-06 08:41:33 EDT <RegularRuben> You can get money back G. Also if you get Truebill app, they'll get you your money back for outages and they can negotiate a lower bill.
1235919918312443905 2020-03-06 08:27:25 EDT <KylerJohnsonDev> @Xfinity has a great setup process, offers easy system control across devices, and consistent internet speed, but you can expect random outages to occur on a more frequent basis when compared to other providers. Something to consider when you often #WorkFromHome
1235902830516396037 2020-03-06 07:19:31 EDT <Tha_Aceman> Thnx. I didn't know they had something like that as I am new.Mine is saying a crazy time like 8 or 9am MSTü§îüòëüò≥ @Xfinity @comcastcares please offer up some insight to your customers on why the outage is taking so long. Ppl aren't as pissy when you let them know what's going on.
1235899360724103169 2020-03-06 07:05:44 EDT <CrackinWax> @comcastcares @Xfinity We have been experiencing intermittent internet outages multiple times per day in our home for some time now. When this happens, all our devices are able to connect to our network, but there is no internet signal. Cont...
1235890264150925314 2020-03-06 06:29:35 EDT <Tha_Aceman> @comcastcares @comcast @Xfinity Any ETA on the outage in Bountiful UT? Trying to game it up this Friday online.
1235887841676152832 2020-03-06 06:19:57 EDT <TheReallMrDean> @Xfinity @comcastcares care to update your customers about the widespread #outage in Colorado and New Mexico??
1235836743594602503 2020-03-06 02:56:55 EDT <DubsUSA> @Xfinity please fix outage. My @SeaOfThieves crew needs me!!!
1235833310162477059 2020-03-06 02:43:16 EDT <KingThelonious> Another day another @Xfinity internet outage.
1235758933538570240 2020-03-05 21:47:43 EDT <DerLindwurm> Xfinity outage. I was out for about 10 minutes in the middle of the match. I still managed to contribute quite a lot to my team's victory.
1235750159180578817 2020-03-05 21:12:51 EDT <dstipton> @comcastcares Ah yes, another outage in Braselton. If there is one thing I can count on with Xfinity, it is outages that take an extensive time to repair. 14 hours and counting. #trashfinity
1235738918164840449 2020-03-05 20:28:11 EDT <KeeeNicole> Xfinity finna piss me off talking bout a outage. ü§î
1235715370096513024 2020-03-05 18:54:37 EDT <Apraxif> @Xfinity I've been having internet outages for over a Year now. 2 agents, new Modem, etc. Nothing has been fixed despite what I recommend. I pay all this money so I could use my internet half a day? This is ridiculous & its sad that it's monopolized in my area and I can't switch.
1235649358252531713 2020-03-05 14:32:18 EDT <vegasmonarch> @Xfinity @comcastcares Why does your outage map show no issue in my area when almost every area around me is showing outages & I'm having internet issues? Hope there's a network team on this already.
1235646547238535168 2020-03-05 14:21:08 EDT <socie> @Xfinity having a WiFi outage in Media, PA. Any details? I work/tweet from home. This is holding me up!
1235588193225003009 2020-03-05 10:29:16 EDT <TreezyMorrison> I‚Äôm trying to figure out why every month there‚Äôs an @Xfinity outage in my area.
1235497266309283841 2020-03-05 04:27:57 EDT <jyozf> @Xfinity please stop having outages while im just trying to enjoy my evening free time. i want to watch youtube videos. fuck off.
1235488232889958401 2020-03-05 03:52:03 EDT <_ohdangit> in the middle of a quiz and discussion and @Xfinity decides to have an outage :)))) not to mention she‚Äôs been playing the game of going out every hour the past few days too :))))
1235464159367778305 2020-03-05 02:16:24 EDT <baaaaadass> Wow Xfinity gotta power outage going on üòí
1235434863882194944 2020-03-05 00:19:59 EDT <MisakiMiamoto> Jokes on you, att is on their 2nd outage in the past couple of weeks
1235434289023643648 2020-03-05 00:17:42 EDT <MisakiMiamoto> Att is awful, everyone has had 2 outages in the past 2 weeks and they're telling us we'll have no wifi for 2 days again
1235421971837566976 2020-03-04 23:28:45 EDT <ChiLanta_180> .@Xfinity are you all experiencing outages? My internet had dropped twice now within hours of each other. And it has yet to return on this last signal drop.  #XFinity
1235408066310336515 2020-03-04 22:33:30 EDT <ArieArie> Total @Xfinity outage at zip 94087 #comcastoutage  Estimated repair, 3/7! more than 2 days!
1235343178280177664 2020-03-04 18:15:39 EDT <Xfinity> Hi! Check your My Account app for any info on outages.
1235343000215138307 2020-03-04 18:14:57 EDT <Miss_Shalor> @Xfinity is there an outage in the Mt. Dora, FL area? We're getting code XRE-03090 on every channel. Already tried unplugging and restarting üò©
1235320713281667072 2020-03-04 16:46:23 EDT <GGosselink> So what I will be evaluating is cost of WOW Internet plus Medium or Large package versus WOW or Xfinity internet plus HULU plus Live.  I work from home with cloud software and your internet outage today cost me big time.
1235319781521321984 2020-03-04 16:42:41 EDT <xMinzu> Anything is better than xfinity 5 mbps upload with 16 hour outage
1235298498456752136 2020-03-04 15:18:07 EDT <TimothyWinfrey> Yes, I've had issues with comcast ever since the power outages. You haven't?
1235293654765506560 2020-03-04 14:58:52 EDT <Xfinity> We don't want you frustrated, are you currently in an area outage?
1235293190569299973 2020-03-04 14:57:01 EDT <BostonMerc> @Xfinity any outages in Revere, Mass? I‚Äôm at work and everything is down but when I call it‚Äôs not under my account.
1235289807175241730 2020-03-04 14:43:35 EDT <SkyWalker_Lupe> Yes I'm checked and it saids outage when will I get my internet back up
1235289450856550400 2020-03-04 14:42:10 EDT <Xfinity> Did you check your My Account app to see if you're in an outage?
1235284600169140224 2020-03-04 14:22:53 EDT <FranceMiami> @Xfinity @comcast worst service again after 10 hours of outages on Monday it is out again. 18 outages in 30 days #comcastoutage #comcast #xfinity #worst service #scam
1235273100142530561 2020-03-04 13:37:11 EDT <FknClimax> I‚Äôm gonna freak out if my internet doesn‚Äôt come back soon. The damn website won‚Äôt even work to tell me if it‚Äôs an area outage @Xfinity
1235268361682071553 2020-03-04 13:18:22 EDT <LaLindaMadre> Same thing is happening to me! App shows everything is fine and I restarted modem and still intermitent outages
1235261917498753025 2020-03-04 12:52:45 EDT <book_tart> As a remote worker, I really love when @Xfinity has consistent internet outages. It's just SUPER helpful to my workflow and well-being.  pic.twitter.com/GuLjMksfHz
1235246991610982400 2020-03-04 11:53:27 EDT <hoodrichxbl> @Xfinity is there an outage? i‚Äôve reset the box multiple times still get no connection.
1235204523464982528 2020-03-04 09:04:42 EDT <dearjanai> @comcastcares @Xfinity outage since i woke up @ 2 a.m. was supposed to be restored @ 7:44 a.m. still nothing!  pic.twitter.com/3rkihIVg4M
1235045290668769281 2020-03-03 22:31:57 EDT <VibrantSara> .... still waiting for this outage to be over... what's taking so long??? They should pro-rate our bill... it's been out for about 6hrs now! WTF! #comcastoutage #XFINITY
1235036002344980480 2020-03-03 21:55:03 EDT <xMinzu> Xfinity pulls a random outage on my entire area and it‚Äôs 8:54pm (peak hours)... been out for 15 min and this has happened at least 5 times in the last month, I‚Äôm switching to AT&T fiber tmrw so u guys will finally be able to watch much higher quality streams
1235035526413115393 2020-03-03 21:53:10 EDT <xMinzu> @Xfinity pulls a random outage, still out for the past 5 minutes, most dogshit internet that exists on the planet I‚Äôm switching to @ATT fiber tmrw
1235030520917946370 2020-03-03 21:33:16 EDT <Xfinity> We know this is frustrating. Are you in an area outage?
1235022942594945024 2020-03-03 21:03:09 EDT <okaypanda> I tried and it said there‚Äôs a video outage in my area. Could that be the problem?
1235001310233026560 2020-03-03 19:37:12 EDT <SparkyRadar> @comcastcares Comcast/Xfinity down again (5 hours and counting) ‚òπÔ∏è Becoming routine...4 local outages (Central CA) in a month and a half. More CapEx on maintenance please!!
1234999240083955712 2020-03-03 19:28:58 EDT <Xfinity> Are you in an area outage?
1234974284281286656 2020-03-03 17:49:48 EDT <JaredR324> That doesn‚Äôt answer my question as to why there was an outage. I missed a full day of work bc of this
1234963837469761537 2020-03-03 17:08:18 EDT <IsbillPhoto> This is one of the best sources for internet outage information.    https://downdetector.com/¬†
1234960553887649793 2020-03-03 16:55:15 EDT <JaredR324> @Xfinity can you please explain why there was a sudden outage at 10-11am this morning in Mt Juliet TN, and why it supposedly won‚Äôt be up until 9:30pm.
1234956106293764098 2020-03-03 16:37:34 EDT <LuisxMartinez_> Fuck Xfinity , And their outages
1234928959629824000 2020-03-03 14:49:42 EDT <BobKomin> @Xfinity my service across the board is failing. For the last 5 days TV did not work with multiple unplanned outages in zip 94027. Scheduled maintenance from 12am-6am this a.m. no improvement. Now I can‚Äôt even log to my account at all to see that my service is out.
1234911319406653440 2020-03-03 13:39:36 EDT <TwigerLoL> I‚Äôm sorry folks, @Xfinity has screwed me over one again and has a reported outage for today as well. Can‚Äôt tell you how sorry I am to have these streams constantly interrupted, will try to contact them and be back for tomorrow.
1234895420716916737 2020-03-03 12:36:26 EDT <TheGiggler64> Working at an answering  service and widespread outages are being reported.
1234891917143552002 2020-03-03 12:22:30 EDT <TearsaSmith> Are @Xfinity customers in #Knoxville having issues? I keep seeing people ask about an outage. #WATE
1234889487689359363 2020-03-03 12:12:51 EDT <acshort_11> got that far, tried to look at the map, and this is all I see. I can only see a fraction of the map due to poor mobile UI  At least I can see that there is an outage acknowleged near my area even though I can‚Äôt see the full area  pic.twitter.com/TKUclpdbBB
1234889160642744321 2020-03-03 12:11:33 EDT <k_trippy2> @Xfinity whats up with all the outages? My service has been down all day and isnt supposed to be fixed for hour????
1234885267045208069 2020-03-03 11:56:05 EDT <AlexEdCarter> Bold move by @Xfinity having an internet outage to get people in TN to leave their house and go vote. #GoVoteTN
1234883109490954242 2020-03-03 11:47:30 EDT <acshort_11> I don‚Äôt know what other service besides @Xfinity limits your ability to check outages by being logged in, but won‚Äôt let you log in because there is an outage in your area
1234873450067570690 2020-03-03 11:09:07 EDT <laxgani> Like salt on an open wound: @comcast @Xfinity forcing me to do an app upgrade before reporting the third outage in a week. (My cell carrier is pricey, but thankfully their dial tone is always on.)
1234868380848590849 2020-03-03 10:48:59 EDT <sunnypep> @Xfinity @ComcastCares 4 outages over an hour each this week alone and you want to raise our bill $80 in two months. Seriously!!
1234843416397258753 2020-03-03 09:09:47 EDT <missjennipher> So @comcast @xfinity rep tells me they can't give me a courtesy credit because they don't see outages last more than 4 hours in my area. Ummm, the app showed the outage. I lost money working b/c of your repeated outages & you tell me you don't see it?! üßêüò§
1234759072420896770 2020-03-03 03:34:38 EDT <KingThelonious> Yo @Xfinity two outages in one night is ridiculous.   I pay way too much to safely game online without having to worry about lag and outages like this.
1234709169275461634 2020-03-03 00:16:20 EDT <uwmy1> @comcast @Xfinity @comcastcares your CS agents need to do a better job. Told them today my Internet was down. They said yes there‚Äôs a known outage. I waited patiently and called an was told there was a TV outage today not internet. Very poor service.
1234634591690018816 2020-03-02 19:19:59 EDT <TheReyBashon> Hey @Xfinity how come you guys try to come fix the service outage in my area then leave my area WHEN MY SERVICE ISNT RESTORED and now I have to wait 2 DAYS for my service to be restored!? THIS IS PATHETIC AND I AM BEYOND PISSED!
1234631135201640448 2020-03-02 19:06:15 EDT <andy_gruhn> @Xfinity how do I view an outage map when I don‚Äôt have an xfinity account set up. I‚Äôm checking for Olympia, Wa

1234607529755324418 2020-03-02 17:32:27 EDT <FranceMiami> @ComcastCares #mobile_Care service is down all the time. No internet since 11:00 am no agent available #xfinity #badservice @Xfinity. Same thing last week. Over las 30 days had to call 18 times to restart modem or for outage.
1234591409354739712 2020-03-02 16:28:24 EDT <mindfulljae> @Xfinity internet outages are super annoying when you have deadlines to meet by 5pm üòí
1234590595655454721 2020-03-02 16:25:10 EDT <ImAllTeeth> Thanks @Xfinity for the second internet outage in under a month. How many more of these before you start prorating people‚Äôs bills, since charging for a month of internet service means, you know, actually providing service? ü§î
1234573674935726082 2020-03-02 15:17:56 EDT <CrawfishKing> So @Comcast #xfinity once again is dealing with an outage in my area. I'm officially done when my contract is up. Went out at 10am, now "probably" won't be available until 9pm. Very unhappy customer, not because of the outage but the amount of outages in a 3 month span. #cmonman
1234315826062331905 2020-03-01 22:13:20 EDT <_TruNaturalista> I am so sick of @Xfinity and these outages.
1234303912431190016 2020-03-01 21:25:59 EDT <Xfinity> Do you have the Xfinity My Account app? I'd screenshot the message if there is an outage in the area.
1234289345240207361 2020-03-01 20:28:06 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked the Xfinity My Account app to see if there is an outage or planned maintenance in your area?
1234263546956935168 2020-03-01 18:45:35 EDT <macnod> Xfinity internet outage in Manteca 95336. These are getting to be quite common. @Xfinity @comcastcares @ComcastCA @xfinitydown
1234258374067445767 2020-03-01 18:25:02 EDT <UnfitChristian> For the third time this week, @Xfinity is experiencing a service outage. One that won‚Äôt be resolved until 9:45 tonight allegedly. Every other day I‚Äôve had an all day outage in Atlanta. But I‚Äôm sure my bill will not reflect a credit üôÉüôÉüôÉüôÉ
1234258316513226753 2020-03-01 18:24:48 EDT <TfpTyler> @Xfinity this outage has been all day. I‚Äôm about to switch to another company
1234216704647057410 2020-03-01 15:39:27 EDT <Xfinity> We can look into crediting your account. Use this link:  http://xfin.tv/support¬† to DM us the info. Also download the Xfinity My Account app for all updates on outage info in your area.
1234202589715034112 2020-03-01 14:43:22 EDT <_2_mendoza> I swear xfinity always has outages üôÑ it‚Äôs the most annoying thing ever
1234200605301727232 2020-03-01 14:35:29 EDT <acylicxo> @Xfinity can you like fuck off with these outages. it's almost every other day
1234181253135552513 2020-03-01 13:18:35 EDT <Varis78> Figures that the one day a week I stay home is the one day there is an outage with Xfinity. Hopefully it gets fixed soon. üòï #FirstWorldProblems
1234160444190928896 2020-03-01 11:55:54 EDT <kaylaringdahl> @Xfinity @Xfinity y‚Äôall planning on fixing the internet anytime soon so I can do my school work or what? And I‚Äôm sure we won‚Äôt receive any type of credit for this outage üôÑ
1234140813233442818 2020-03-01 10:37:53 EDT <truss2016> @Xfinity service is horrible it‚Äôs been some type of outage everyday this week. Not one day but everyday. The prices aren‚Äôt worth all the hassle. Currently looking to cut the cord.
1233978309421211648 2020-02-29 23:52:09 EDT <kunaldo> @Xfinity what‚Äôs going on with the outages today?  I didn‚Äôt have internet this morning and it magically came back, now it‚Äôs back out again. All this with no acknowledgement of the outage and no ETA on restoration of service.
1233969780115136517 2020-02-29 23:18:16 EDT <JakeyBoy1982> @Xfinity you‚Äôre killing me with all the outages lately, but I‚Äôve never been more angry about it that I am tonight. I‚Äôm missing boxing because of this crap!
1233913484087353345 2020-02-29 19:34:34 EDT <flahoolick1947> Now X1Platform isn‚Äôt working. Picture pixelated. No outages reported in area. Get it together, guys @Xfinity  https://twitter.com/flahoolick1947/status/1233910269165940736¬†‚Ä¶
1233912251146436611 2020-02-29 19:29:40 EDT <MoonHuntersNJ> its always like xfinity to take your self funtime away :)  Ive had it where you go to the web browser annnnnnd internet drops out due to an outage. Sucks.
1233875233045700608 2020-02-29 17:02:34 EDT <movntainmama> Living on post means we can only get @Xfinity for internet and 100% they‚Äôre a fucking JOKE. We have outages every. single. day. It‚Äôs not our bill or router, they‚Äôre just the worst damn service imaginable. We pay way too much for this trash but there is nothing else. üôÉ
1233854663654506502 2020-02-29 15:40:50 EDT <Akikebi> @comcastcares @Xfinity Having an internet outage sucks, especially on the weekend. There was an ETA and now that's gone... what is going on?
1233834215340376065 2020-02-29 14:19:35 EDT <Vandevious7> I pay for Gigabit internet service... And it was rock solid for until about 1-2 months ago. Now, we are seeing weekly, sometimes daily outages... That go on for hours. The last two really long outages were 13 and 16 hours.
1233816152360603648 2020-02-29 13:07:48 EDT <JonCarroll03> If anyone is worried about getting their steps in for a day, I highly recommend getting @Xfinity Internet services.  Constant outages and the solution is always to Restart the Router. You will be getting up off the couch every 15 minutes or so.   #AngryJC
1233811842406985729 2020-02-29 12:50:41 EDT <eddiewouldgobro> @Xfinity #frequentiutages #xfinity the frequency of your outages is ridiculous!!!!!!
1233801521017606144 2020-02-29 12:09:40 EDT <ThePadMan26> What the heck @Xfinity why does it take almost 4 hours to resolve an outage??? Of all days and times now??
1233646826902802432 2020-02-29 01:54:58 EDT <techpro4000> ü§ó to @comcastcares because Xfinity g‚Ä¶  Comcast in United States: speed, performance, outages and user reviews üëâ  https://internet.fing.com/provider/Comcast%20Cable/US?utm_source=mobile_share&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=dropdetect¬†‚Ä¶ #fing #internet #Comcast  via @fingapp @outagedetect
1233598953230303239 2020-02-28 22:44:44 EDT <ShealynEllesse> @Xfinity What is going on? Is there an outage in my area? This is ridiculous
1233594974169698305 2020-02-28 22:28:55 EDT <JimmyTheDunn> It's back now. It would be helpful if there was some indication of what caused the outage when this happens and what steps Comcast is taking to prevent the same outage occurring in the future
1233588319042195457 2020-02-28 22:02:28 EDT <TheBodaShow> Friday night, settling in with my lady, ready to relax and unwind while watching some TV. Lo and behold, @Xfinity has a service outage. This along with their refusal to bring back @AltitudeTV has forced my hand. @DIRECTV what do you have to offer me in Denver?
1233577156401418241 2020-02-28 21:18:07 EDT <Xfinity> We know this has been frustrating, are you seeing a time of completion for the outage in your My Account app?
1233575600075550721 2020-02-28 21:11:56 EDT <JimmyTheDunn> That makes two days in a row with an evening @Xfinity local outage. Both times their site tried to tell me it was a problem with my equipment. Remind me why I do business with them again? Oh yeah, they're the only game in town.
1233574070165426176 2020-02-28 21:05:51 EDT <amkovacs> @Xfinity just stop patronizing us. You couldn‚Äôt care less how many lives, livelihoods & life events you are disrupting with this ongoing outage. Don‚Äôt pretend you‚Äôll make it right. Going on 6 hrs and maybe, just maybe it will be fixed by EOD. Incompetence in action.
1233560723831316485 2020-02-28 20:12:49 EDT <mbayer1248> @Xfinity outage on a Friday night. Not a time people expect to be able to use the cable/internet we pay an absurd amount of money for or anything. Will they reimburse us? Of course not. Do something to make it up to customers? L-O-L. Comcast is the undefeated worst company ever.
1233558639857848322 2020-02-28 20:04:32 EDT <gustavoacosta88> @Xfinity what‚Äôs going on with the outage in Chicago (Lakeview)? It was supposed to be repairs by 6:20 and now it says 10?!
1233558625785962496 2020-02-28 20:04:29 EDT <ortegar5> @Xfinity finally get time to sit down to relax and watch tv. But.. @Xfinity decides to stop working. Outages occurring everywhere? Maybe time to look into @Uverse
1233554811171287041 2020-02-28 19:49:19 EDT <PortierSeth> @Xfinity been without internet for almost 5 hours now.  App says there us no outage but there is.  Had a guy working on the lines on my street and have been messed up ever since. What gives? Pay 90 bucks and it's always out.
1233554294886019075 2020-02-28 19:47:16 EDT <mrbpconnelly> We shouldn‚Äôt have to pay when cable and ISPs like @Xfinity and @comcast have outages. Utilities don‚Äôt get paid if they aren‚Äôt transmitting. It might not be a lot for one house, but multiply it by 3 to 4 thousand and bean counters might take notice. They are a utility. #Outages
1233552951651840000 2020-02-28 19:41:56 EDT <debbles773> @Xfinity there‚Äôs been a Chicago outage since 3 - get your shit together. I also want a credit got my lost work time. #comcastoutage

1233546141565882368 2020-02-28 19:14:52 EDT <rbalbale> The fact that listening to my @Sonos is actually controlled by the quality of my @Xfinity internet is just wrong! #outage == #nomusic!!
1233533004548628485 2020-02-28 18:22:40 EDT <Harayda> @Xfinity what is the reason for my outage in Lakeview, Chicago? Was this scheduled? No internet, no tv. No message alert. Why?
1233526902297677824 2020-02-28 17:58:25 EDT <marasantanaaa> @Xfinity how exactly can you tell your clients there‚Äôs an outage that won‚Äôt be resolved until 9pm (it started at 3pm...) how am I supposed to finish my work day?  pic.twitter.com/2pYgDiUVpP
1233518831630536710 2020-02-28 17:26:21 EDT <Xfinity> Hey. You can use your My Account app to check if you're in an outage and for updates!

1233503596869832705 2020-02-28 16:25:49 EDT <Xfinity> We can check. Are you seeing an outage showing in your My Account app?
1233503398084907009 2020-02-28 16:25:02 EDT <itstokyorift> Idk who at Xfinity is trying to sabotage me...my internet will be fine every week, but when a qualifier weekend comes without fail there‚Äôs an outage.   I must‚Äôve shushed one of you guys for playing 1-bar OBS in Champs or something smdh üòí
1233493453251731456 2020-02-28 15:45:31 EDT <Xfinity> We know this is frustrating. Does your My Account app show an outage, and if so, a time of completion?
1233490658465284096 2020-02-28 15:34:24 EDT <kelly_virginia> lol xfinity has outage from west town to logan square. working from home is a treat.

1233472893520138240 2020-02-28 14:23:49 EDT <AnindaKar7> @Xfinity when you are working from home.. never trust xfinity internet , they can have outage at any moment.Disgusting @comcast
1233464760139730946 2020-02-28 13:51:30 EDT <ayeschepp> Need recommendations on a new WiFi. We have @Xfinity through @comcastcares and I swear we‚Äôve been having an area outage once a week and when it does work, it‚Äôs slow as can be
1233441452627238912 2020-02-28 12:18:53 EDT <NathanBlakeGame> Why is it, that the week I start streaming Xfinity has to start having daily outages in my area?
1233420720107073536 2020-02-28 10:56:30 EDT <carrieberry121> @Xfinity hey howcome my internet goes out ATLEAST once a day? And when I try to use your terrible website, it doesnt work. And no, there arent outages in my area.
1233395756696002560 2020-02-28 09:17:18 EDT <Xfinity> Hi, if you're still in an outage, and haven't done so already, check the My account app to track the status of your services.  Here's more on how to do that:  http://comca.st/2NhfkXB¬† <<

1233068734924939266 2020-02-27 11:37:50 EDT <svntivgxgh> @Xfinity y'all better work on this outage, my family literally pays almost 200 dollars for you to be on this bullshit? day in and day out it's guaranteed that we're going to have shitty fucking internet and we pay a premium price for lack luster internet. stupid asf.

1233002653036240898 2020-02-27 07:15:15 EDT <RipTideJay> @Xfinity everyday since February 17th between 5:30-6:00 EST, your internet service gets reported out or outages reported in my area. When will this be fixed?! And when will I get my awesome internet service back?
1232944943867416576 2020-02-27 03:25:56 EDT <WONPOO> Fuck @Xfinity your shit service cost me a ranked match in @LeagueOfLegends  I pay on time monthly for decent service and I‚Äôm hit with outages and random maintenance all month long. I should not be worried about my service if The only ISP in my area is you guys. 95340 get on it!
1232942072170254337 2020-02-27 03:14:31 EDT <theCRISTYshow> Oh it‚Äôs an outage. Count your days xfinity. Count your effing days
1232915786903310336 2020-02-27 01:30:04 EDT <natepthomps> Every time our Xfinity has an internet outage it makes me re-verify my modem and it‚Äôs the most annoying shit.
1232913027785265153 2020-02-27 01:19:06 EDT <jrock_nole> Imagine that, there‚Äôs a @xfinity service outage after it was down last week for ‚Äúsystem‚Äôs maintenance‚Äù üòÇ

Your expeditious attention toward service restoration would be much appreciated. Thanks, RE
1232787465653620736 2020-02-26 17:00:10 EDT <Bobdoll12809030> Noone worth buying is available near me also. They swear it isnt an outage. @Xfinity must not do a very good job of either training or hiring candidates that are competent. Still to this minute we are waiting for help lol
1232768220861476870 2020-02-26 15:43:42 EDT <Xfinity> We can hep with your bill due to this outage. Send us a DM:  https://xfin.tv/support¬† <---
1232767470739607552 2020-02-26 15:40:43 EDT <CocoCamm> @Xfinity we pay a ridiculous amount of money for your overpriced service the least you could do was not leave us without cable and internet all day. I don't suppose you're going to refund your customers for all the time of this outage?
1232756469281390592 2020-02-26 14:57:00 EDT <Tori_Rhea_Wats> @Xfinity Hey what's the point of having high internet speeds if there is CONSTANT OUTAGES?!?! So fucking stupid.
1232748224915660801 2020-02-26 14:24:14 EDT <andrew_pett> @Xfinity unacceptable! Three days in a row with ‚Äúoutages‚Äù and no visibility from a customer standpoint. Called and told no resolution to cable and WiFi being out until 6pm. Tough look
1232742891383975936 2020-02-26 14:03:03 EDT <Sammy_Sama> Two outages, two days in a row. Thanks @Xfinity for your shitty service and making sure I can't stream.
1232731568482832385 2020-02-26 13:18:03 EDT <Rasczack> @Xfinity why are we having daily outages for our internet?
1232731023521337344 2020-02-26 13:15:53 EDT <Xfinity> Hi, you can also let us know about an outage and troubleshoot through the My Account app. Here's more on how to do that:  http://comca.st/2NhfkXB¬†. <<
1232725897205207042 2020-02-26 12:55:31 EDT <Blkrockr> @Xfinity when someone calls because their service is down, maybe you shouldn't try to sell them something before fixing the problem. Also if you're calling to report and repair an outage, why do you have to verify the account twice?
1232711290382102529 2020-02-26 11:57:28 EDT <ng_tracyy> So, what‚Äôs #DCTech doing during the Xfinity outage?  pic.twitter.com/Dd8bahgtO5
1232683170610499585 2020-02-26 10:05:44 EDT <jmcfarland_> Both? Pay for gigabit and rarely do I see my connection over 150Mbps. Two outages in 4 days and disconnects peppered throughout the week. Fun times!
1232670171426414592 2020-02-26 09:14:05 EDT <brandonk204> I checked the outage map my area is having problems
1232646040051953666 2020-02-26 07:38:12 EDT <keithpille> Anybody else in Minneapolis with Comcast/xfinity having an internet outage?

1232627732787298304 2020-02-26 06:25:27 EDT <leiaflamingo> @nbcbayarea @kron4news @kpix @KTVU @ABCNewsBayArea_  what‚Äôs up with @Xfinity @comcast? They‚Äôre saying an outage that is going to last THREE days is routine maintenance. But using their app to see the areas of the outage it says ‚Äúunplanned‚Äù. So which is it? And why THREE DAYS?
1232591311418511360 2020-02-26 04:00:43 EDT <BuehlersSon> @Xfinity you shouldn‚Äôt take 3 and a half hours to fix an outage
1232579150793211904 2020-02-26 03:12:24 EDT <leiaflamingo> @Xfinity @comcastcares @comcast how can it be routine maintenance when all of the outages on the map were unplanned?  pic.twitter.com/8ASP8n2BO0
1232542992369455105 2020-02-26 00:48:43 EDT <jaredmecham> @comcastcares @Xfinity I am paying for 1gbps down/30mbps up and am not even getting 1mbps down right now. No report of outages... what gives? I‚Äôm hardwired and wireless with no change.  Can someone look into this?
1232496322902495232 2020-02-25 21:43:16 EDT <pavcrain> This outage is unbelievable. What's going on? It's been 5 hours and expecting several hours more?!
1232466437265969153 2020-02-25 19:44:31 EDT <Ayooo_Jasz> @Xfinity @comcast is trash. They make appts and don‚Äôt show up. They have ‚Äúoutages‚Äù and don‚Äôt tell their customers. & the fucking hotspots don‚Äôt even work.
1232446193491267584 2020-02-25 18:24:04 EDT <SoundAlertsApp> Comcast/Xfinity customers may currently experience outages with Sound Alerts. Comcast is wrongly blocking the connection to the Google Firebase server where Sound Alerts is hosted. Google is trying to get this fixed with Comcast asap. We deeply apologize for the inconvenience.

1232405094861328385 2020-02-25 15:40:46 EDT <lakersaretrash1> @Xfinity why i have no internet in my house? Is there an outage in Philly?
1232394386908045312 2020-02-25 14:58:13 EDT <Xfinity> How are you connected currently? Were you having any speed issues before the outage?
1232331408477171712 2020-02-25 10:47:58 EDT <buckner1673> @comcastcares I have telephone and Internet service but my TV service is down. I live in Dunkirk, Indiana. I noticed we had a power outage sometime early this morning. Is their a problem with Xfinity TV ?

1232125716113825794 2020-02-24 21:10:37 EDT <Xfinity> We can check. Do you see any outage notifications in your Xfinity My Account App?

1232016879402835975 2020-02-24 13:58:08 EDT <comcast> You'll be notified of any planned outages or scheduled maintenance up to 3 days prior through the Xfinity My Account app. -Gabbie
1232014761333862402 2020-02-24 13:49:43 EDT <Xfinity> Did you check your My Account app to see if you're in an outage?
1231927265505705992 2020-02-24 08:02:02 EDT <_smokebeard> .@Xfinity continues its abysmal performance from the weekend. The conflicting information on their site is really reassuring. Main webpage says there is an outage in my area but the outage map says I have service. .@comcastcares
1231830761751404549 2020-02-24 01:38:34 EDT <canyeetee> @Xfinity another outage, never experienced an outade with any other provider. nice! if youre going to force me to use your service in this area you better make it work right. üëåüèæ #xfinitysucks
1231781688289775616 2020-02-23 22:23:34 EDT <officiallyjnmc> man, listen... imma be 38 if Xfinity cause me to miss my deadline tonight. this outage been going on for hours.
1231780299354394624 2020-02-23 22:18:03 EDT <Jushido_Brown> This Xfinity outage really bodied me
1231751118029500416 2020-02-23 20:22:06 EDT <guywithspot07> @Xfinity is a 9+ hour outage normal when the weather is perfectly clear?
1231741924157075457 2020-02-23 19:45:34 EDT <markymarc__> Xfinity really decided to have an outage right now smh
1231736740123156485 2020-02-23 19:24:58 EDT <ImSareBear> I have Xfinity, and we often have internet outages every couple of months. It's just unreliable sometimes. That's just in my area, but I've heard of other areas with a similar issue. It's a great service when it works. I'd just look into it for your area.
1231720635392458752 2020-02-23 18:20:58 EDT <Xfinity> Do you have the Xfinity My Account app? You can keep track of the status of the outage through it.
1231720472712269824 2020-02-23 18:20:19 EDT <__NotSoSerious> There‚Äôs an outage that‚Äôs been going on for about two hours.
1231704965590257665 2020-02-23 17:18:42 EDT <kissthequeenb> Xfinity has a outage in my areaü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1231687758424358912 2020-02-23 16:10:19 EDT <gunnarwb> @Xfinity we had high wind storms in Medina,WA. I wanted to check if you were aware of a wide outage. Tried using your website but it wanted me to test my modem...
1231658838845087745 2020-02-23 14:15:24 EDT <zstuffs> Well @Xfinity & @comcastcares has no support staff working who reside in the US today. Major outage and nobody can respond for at least a day.
1231598973930082304 2020-02-23 10:17:32 EDT <Nikkkimm> Dear xfinity, there is no time for there to be an outage in my area. I have shows to watch. Don‚Äôt play games with my Sunday relaxing.
1231582584750137346 2020-02-23 09:12:24 EDT <marypjanoush> @Xfinity our outage has almost been 24 hours... this is ridiculous
1231561231158390784 2020-02-23 07:47:33 EDT <jessirobertson> I just got off a chat with @comcast @xfinity. They said internet won‚Äôt be fixed until 11PM tonight! The outage map estimate is obviously a lie. They won‚Äôt give any other info.
1231466497198813185 2020-02-23 01:31:07 EDT <steveterrell> I was at my brother‚Äôs house to watch the Fury/Wilder fight. He‚Äôd paid more than $80 for the pay per view. We caught a couple of the prelim fights, but right before the main event, the internet connection fails. @Xfinity told us there was an outage in the area. Thanks @Xfinity
1231462748787179520 2020-02-23 01:16:13 EDT <ShirleyAlaine> It‚Äôs so weird that it‚Äôs been and outage for Xfinity services in our area in Nashville all day long üò°  https://twitter.com/RaeOnTheNews/status/1231350846371164160¬†‚Ä¶
1231459679915606018 2020-02-23 01:04:01 EDT <SaraBeara_Beth> Happy 24 hours of no service!  We‚Äôre now looking at 32 hours of an outage/ no service.   If we reach 2 days- you‚Äôd better brace yourself for hell. @Xfinity    First world problems but still costing me extra money for data and other charges.  pic.twitter.com/fqfdgscjVA
1231418945862819840 2020-02-22 22:22:10 EDT <SaraBeara_Beth> I‚Äôm in the sylvan park area and my map is showing sylvan park, belle meade and into parts of green hills but that‚Äôs all.   They claimed there was a main cable that had a leak and it has been causing all the outages this past month and they are replacing it
1231413419070414849 2020-02-22 22:00:12 EDT <vipe29> Yeah, I didn‚Äôt even bother to call, because I had been fighting a migraine. Since my app was telling me there was an outage, I didn‚Äôt bother.
1231395385140219905 2020-02-22 20:48:32 EDT <djbigdaddy> Tried to order the fight on Comcast/Xfinity and it wouldn't come in. Said they are having a national outage. But it took 30 minutes to get that answer. @Xfinity you have to worst customer service
1231387764345712646 2020-02-22 20:18:15 EDT <StellaMaris159> One sucky situation about living in Baltimore City is being stuck with @Xfinity and still dealing with outages. Thanks for screwing up Saturday night with this crap. Now I get to try to fix my stuff that it messed up.
1231321084596756480 2020-02-22 15:53:18 EDT <SaraBeara_Beth> Lollll omggggg   10:pm now.  So we‚Äôre going for a full 24 hour outage huh.   @Xfinity   Y‚Äôall gonna day anything or....? Do I need to call in and start bitching  pic.twitter.com/7yRts17PWI
1231312664267116544 2020-02-22 15:19:50 EDT <Coach_DiegoB> @Xfinity is there a service outage in zip code 87113, Abq NM??
1231310088687824897 2020-02-22 15:09:36 EDT <mychempunk> Me waiting for @comcast / @Xfinity to fix the outage that we've been suffering from off and on for the past two weeks.  pic.twitter.com/zCPhUu4c01
1231299499194277888 2020-02-22 14:27:31 EDT <Richie_nez1> @Xfinity if there is no outage in my area, why don‚Äôt I have service. No other issues to report so there must be an outage...
1231286119037272066 2020-02-22 13:34:21 EDT <JordanQuinn7> . @Xfinity Just your daily outage report to remind you guys how terrible of a service you have. The typical troubleshooting doesn‚Äôt even work this time. If anybody would like to buy me out of this god awful contract, shoot me a message (talking to you @ATT)!
1231284611226927111 2020-02-22 13:28:22 EDT <DavidRyleeWill2> @Xfinity is there an outage in the Mississippi area? Just wondering
1231284558974160896 2020-02-22 13:28:09 EDT <BMeece92> What‚Äôs new.... Xfinity internet is having an outage üôÑ
1231244847199268866 2020-02-22 10:50:21 EDT <WillConwayEsq> @Xfinity Any idea on the outage in Nashville? I would like to watch the Tennessee basketball game.
1231237881924067330 2020-02-22 10:22:41 EDT <millster97> @Xfinity outage that doesn‚Äôt get fixed until 1....conveniently AFTER the @AuburnMBB game. Gotta love itüôÉ
1231173958621442050 2020-02-22 06:08:40 EDT <SaraBeara_Beth> Not to be that person but- monthly @Xfinity rant:   My rates keep rising and yet the service still sucks. 5th outage of the month in my area.  This one has last from 12:15am and I still currently running (5am)  Y‚Äôall lucky I literally have NO other internet option in my area ü§¨
1231050266683768833 2020-02-21 21:57:10 EDT <jhoanchacon> @Xfinity live in Doral FL and I have been without internet since 11:00 AM plus all I get is an answer machine saying "we are experience outage in your area" of course I'm that I already know, this is the longest I ever experienced.
1231041219700154368 2020-02-21 21:21:13 EDT <AlmyTimp> Booo to @xfinity. Service has been out since about 5:30pm (Augusta Georgia). The map says only "1 to 50" customers impacted...lol. I drove around the area, didn't see a single #Xfinity service vehicle anywhere. Might be time to switch to @ATT.   @comcastcares #comcast #outage
1231029399916511233 2020-02-21 20:34:15 EDT <mjtam> Please, @Xfinity - it‚Äôs the weekend and my teens are home. We need you to fix the outage! #Chicago #SouthLoop #Chinayown
1231017593411997696 2020-02-21 19:47:20 EDT <HorrocksTyson> Gotta love when everyone‚Äôs internet is out in your neighborhood and has been all afternoon but @Xfinity refuses to call it an ‚Äúoutage.‚Äù  Great customer service üôÑ
1230973843398942723 2020-02-21 16:53:29 EDT <sherlock2g> Xfinity you fucking up my money with these power outages.
1230915201513463808 2020-02-21 13:00:27 EDT <recarm_> Ok yeah it's an outage i can't connect to the Xfinity public WiFi either
1230905243094876161 2020-02-21 12:20:53 EDT <robpetrozzo> Do you have Comcast/Xfinity internet? Theres an ongoing issue w/ outages on their network causing this w/ a bunch of apps, ours included. Off wifi should work + we're working w/ Comcast to get updates and distribute too all members. drop me a note if it continues (rob[at]rallyrd)
1230899544180871168 2020-02-21 11:58:14 EDT <WozTen> I get drops and long outages constantly when temps drop below 5 and Comcast doesn't believe it is them. Must be my new modem and router that is better than their piece of junk.
1230864616953204736 2020-02-21 09:39:27 EDT <LetsGo_Ugo> The one day I decide to work from home, Xfinity has an outage and I have to come into this office anyway.  pic.twitter.com/Hm4V6qaJpz
1230854597348151296 2020-02-21 08:59:38 EDT <SrRdn> It says there are no service outages in my area.
1230851304806899712 2020-02-21 08:46:33 EDT <tunedout> Xfinity tech was out, and ran into another tech while checking my connections at the pole. Looks like a bigger network outage.
1230823804919853058 2020-02-21 06:57:17 EDT <FrCuzn> @Xfinity outages in my area.... How's about I have a payment outage!
1230817282374406144 2020-02-21 06:31:22 EDT <FrCuzn> Is there currently a @Xfinity outage in the Fox Lake area in Illinois?
1230782443340226565 2020-02-21 04:12:55 EDT <Vole182> @Xfinity there is an outage in my area. I need to get back online for work with our Australian office.
1230721571876032514 2020-02-21 00:11:03 EDT <Bizzy_Creations> @Xfinity ur WiFi is still shit y‚Äôall need to do something bout all these random outages mid stream/game and it just goes out fuck y‚Äôall
1230611841560326145 2020-02-20 16:55:01 EDT <Xfinity> Are you able to check the My Account app to see if you are in an area wide outage?
1230552774670245888 2020-02-20 13:00:18 EDT <DanielNist> Internet has been down, or limping along for 3 hours now. So @comcast @Xfinity @comcastcares can you explain how there isn't an outage, when the most recent outage map clearly shows the majority of the US having issues?   "Nothing to see here. Please disperse." üôÑ  pic.twitter.com/ApCCXkxB7j
1230507071973580804 2020-02-20 09:58:42 EDT <Wntrlily> Why does @Comcast make calling them for an issue so difficult? @comcastcares @ComcastILLINOIS @Xfinity I shouldn't have to fight so hard arguing with a machine to find out there's an outage.

1230231675814191107 2020-02-19 15:44:22 EDT <Xfinity> Have you been in an area outage?
1230218023841271808 2020-02-19 14:50:07 EDT <maverickred_02> Once again, there is a Comcast/Xfinity outage in my area. After what happened Sunday and Monday I signed up for the text alerts when there is an outage. There was no alert, now I see on the app that a technician is working on things...
1230202293867470848 2020-02-19 13:47:37 EDT <Xfinity> You can keep track of the outage with updates through the My Account app.
1230151509792432128 2020-02-19 10:25:49 EDT <JdubK3986> @comcast @Xfinity @comcastcares this is the 4th or 5th outage mid-day in the last two weeks while I'm working online.

1229993221356306433 2020-02-18 23:56:50 EDT <JojoShunk> @Xfinity I have officially had it!  Les and less channels, yet no reduction in the bill, and now our 4 outage in a month!  It used to be I‚Äôd put up with you bc your product was good although your service sucked.  Now they both suck!  So fed up with the BS!
1229978882943651840 2020-02-18 22:59:52 EDT <BlackNTheCity> @comcast @Xfinity I want to pay what the service is worth. Service outages every week I‚Äôm paying over $200 a month. Service is worth half that. Can‚Äôt even get someone on the phone. How long must we endure substandard services?

1229876802279104513 2020-02-18 16:14:14 EDT <MrCobaltCRG> @RCNconnects really makes me consider switching to xFinity. They deny outages and try to get you to pay for technician visits instead. Terrible and shady business practices.

1229468523048644608 2020-02-17 13:11:52 EDT <TheErikHood> @Xfinity Is there any known outages in the Pittsburgh area? I have reset my modem several times and no internet.
1229427245422403584 2020-02-17 10:27:51 EDT <jamesctaylor123> @Xfinity @comcastcares need to report an internet outage in Jacksonville, FL
1229401792347353096 2020-02-17 08:46:43 EDT <Xfinity> Yes you can check on outages or planned maintenance through the Xfinity My Account app. You'll be notified of maintenance up to 3 days prior.
1229398612498579456 2020-02-17 08:34:04 EDT <coheeba7> @Xfinity Service outage 24 hrs in Lower Grand Lagoon Panama City FL. WHAT GIVES???
1229397606352269312 2020-02-17 08:30:05 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Michele. Does your My Account app indicate you're in an outage?
1229267378460119040 2020-02-16 23:52:36 EDT <AdamAndrew> @comcastcares Why in the Xfinity Account app does it show my modem red status after restarting in the troubleshooter? There is also no reported outages in my area according to that tool as well.
1229192759099166721 2020-02-16 18:56:05 EDT <kranzman> Today in oddly specific statements, xfinity is having an outage in my area and they promised it would be back up "by 8:08pm"
1229175833891426307 2020-02-16 17:48:50 EDT <xMinzu> Xfinity is THE worst internet service provider of all isp‚Äôs, there is ZERO excuse as to why an internet outage happens at 4:30PM CST with NO warning for a good 15 minutes
1229103894074200064 2020-02-16 13:02:58 EDT <TaraNMay> Explain to me the f***ing point of having to pay for @Xfinity when I‚Äôm having outages every single week, for hours on end?!?! What ‚Äúservice‚Äù am I exactly paying for??
1229039154236973057 2020-02-16 08:45:43 EDT <BivenKitty> Comcast/Xfinity Not happy with my service which goes out frequently. Was told after two LOOOOOOOOOOONG outages that I would receive refunds. Another lie.
1228981513389211648 2020-02-16 04:56:40 EDT <aw055> Outage has been going on for hoursssss feel free to Fix it @Xfinity
1228875200571281410 2020-02-15 21:54:13 EDT <aw055> Feel free to fix the outage @Xfinity  horrible timing ü§¨
1228860462546268160 2020-02-15 20:55:40 EDT <blazinpyro123> I apologise for any one who was watching my last 2 streams and they cut out....Xfinity had outages only on those 2 days for 6 hours each sooo I'm a bad streamer haha  pic.twitter.com/uNw7eo3QEJ
1228853169960181762 2020-02-15 20:26:41 EDT <preischbeer> @Xfinity tried to report an outage and instead you cancelled my account and say it can‚Äôt be reinstated without getting a new plan!! Seems shady to me
1228844386735337474 2020-02-15 19:51:47 EDT <1001cranes> Playing the "is there an Xfinity outage or am I just special" game
1228843959545466881 2020-02-15 19:50:05 EDT <LalaThomas_> @Xfinity when are you guys going to fix the outage in Chicago?
1228811493908582402 2020-02-15 17:41:05 EDT <fabshannille> @Xfinity @comcastcares @comcast is there some sort of outage with the boxes? Voice control went out, got a new remote & that one doesn‚Äôt work either. #xfinity
1228809882444406790 2020-02-15 17:34:40 EDT <Okay_OofBaboof> @comcast @Xfinity is awesome because they‚Äôll tell you there‚Äôs no outage and the issue is on your end even though you‚Äôre in the middle of a sea of outages.  pic.twitter.com/YFbpVE7HeS
1228804142799446017 2020-02-15 17:11:52 EDT <LuvableNissa> @Xfinity this outage is simply outrageous!!! The customer service is horrible . #NotAHappyCustomer #ItsBeenAllDay #MissingWork
1228774961554157569 2020-02-15 15:15:55 EDT <Gregg22832715> @comcastcares So, I checked outside connections -- tight. Indoor connections...tight. So why is the US/DS light blinking on modem? Status center on xfinity website doesn't say any outages. Howver, in past, when this happened, customer service sent out a techc -- but tech said....
1228764072033677312 2020-02-15 14:32:38 EDT <knightnurse2> @Xfinity another outage?? 2 days in a row now??
1228757609542324224 2020-02-15 14:06:57 EDT <Scribbles69> Well I was attempting to stream #metrolastlight but apparently theres a #xfinity outage in my area sooo postponed I guess
1228725844132192258 2020-02-15 12:00:44 EDT <davelatella> @comcast @xfinity the frequency of your outages lately is ridiculous!!!!!
1228725513130213377 2020-02-15 11:59:25 EDT <davelatella> @comcastcares, @xfinity your frequency of outages lately is ridiculous!!!
1228723764856266752 2020-02-15 11:52:28 EDT <recoba_bruno> @Xfinity Ur taking too long to fix the outage. I need to watch the office.
1228723719415193601 2020-02-15 11:52:17 EDT <geenosr> @Xfinity my internet is down, and after trying to check your status center and outage map on my cell phone they are both unavailable right now. Is this a local issue or something more serious? Panama City FL
1228583041301389313 2020-02-15 02:33:17 EDT <Clabian96> @comcast @Xfinity Is the worst ISP I've ever had. I've never had so many outages... 6 in the last 30 days is absurd. I wonder if I can be compensated for the money I've lost...
1228556729329147905 2020-02-15 00:48:44 EDT <Angry_Optimist_> Not as frustrating as the expected 10-plus hour outage we‚Äôre in the midst of.   ü§¨ü§¨  And yes, I‚Äôve been through all the troubleshooting including a few exotic ones.  However, I did not sacrifice a goat in the parking lot of an @Xfinity store.  That one seemed messy.  üòâ
1228524300178583552 2020-02-14 22:39:52 EDT <EroticaGood> . @sonic Use to have Xfinity. Outages were frequent. Switched to Sonic. This is first outage since, other than the one that was our fault (water in outdoor circuit blowing GFI).  Anyway THANK YOU. People love to hate when something breaks but forget to love when it all works +
1228510739997978625 2020-02-14 21:45:59 EDT <dekeOquirrh> Well now I‚Äôm hearing the @Xfinity outage is affecting the whole county and it might not be restored until Sunday! Well @Xfinity when will we have services restored? Seriously you have too many outages for the amount of $$$$ you bleed from us.
1228504033683484674 2020-02-14 21:19:20 EDT <brianhwaters> Dear @Xfinity, you are running a inhome date night by having an outage. Signed a married man with two kids and no baby sitter.
1228488774637772801 2020-02-14 20:18:42 EDT <kevputz> @comcastcares @Xfinity Outage Report from here in Evanston, IL:  No @MSNBC tonight. Just a blank screen with a rolling ‚Äú...‚Äù thinking/working graphic. ü§¨ When will this channel be back on the air?
1228484704288038913 2020-02-14 20:02:32 EDT <e_cooper> @Xfinity 2 days without internet service.  Facebook lit up with people complaining.  I‚Äôm told there is no outage.  BS!  Ask to speak to a manager.  You hang up on me.  Get your act together!
1228464809865166848 2020-02-14 18:43:29 EDT <8bittroy> Only Xfinity would have an outage on Valentine's day. There goes our plans for the night.  pic.twitter.com/5k8fAe28Nz
1228463159159271424 2020-02-14 18:36:55 EDT <gaurav_anand76> @Xfinity @comcastcares wondering why Xfinity cannot resolve my intenet issue for the last 3 days. My internet service at home went down Wednesday afternoon. Per Comcast no service outage. My neighbors Comcast internet works and mine doesn‚Äôt.
1228459681284157440 2020-02-14 18:23:06 EDT <TheBadMerc> Thanks @xfinity for the outage until 730. .... Some people have work to do.
1228425829128003585 2020-02-14 16:08:35 EDT <haleybriggs> When you take the afternoon off to do homework but there is an @Xfinity outage #typical
1228410064014323712 2020-02-14 15:05:56 EDT <FloridianEagle> @Xfinity Internet Service outage in 33901 area again! Losing business, losing customers.
1228406190025170949 2020-02-14 14:50:33 EDT <SDNgeek> Ok, confirmed xfinity outage in my area. Lawn guys are off the hook.
1228403093676711938 2020-02-14 14:38:14 EDT <BellAustinJames> Another day another @comcastcares @comcast @Xfinity outage. Hard to work from home with no internet. This after I got it back up last night after two days without. So frustrating.  pic.twitter.com/J0YuzQgGYt
1228384828535582720 2020-02-14 13:25:40 EDT <Xfinity> Do you see an outage showing in your My Account app?
1228329645298323456 2020-02-14 09:46:23 EDT <pdubuque> You have an outage and you refuse to take a call from your customers!  Not good customer service.  Actually anti-customer service.  You won‚Äôt even talk to you customers????
1228314040528711681 2020-02-14 08:44:22 EDT <Xfinity> Hey. If you're in an area outage, keep an eye on your My Account app for updates.
1228313667411873792 2020-02-14 08:42:53 EDT <_isissssssss> @Xfinity Why am I experiencing a internet outage. Count your days!!!
1228309004922900480 2020-02-14 08:24:22 EDT <Xfinity> Fight the urge to buy something! Are you seeing yourself in an area outage in your My Account app?
1228259273110675456 2020-02-14 05:06:45 EDT <AscariHusky> Had to call @comcast @Xfinity tonight due to an internet outage at my house. The rep did an absolutely terrible job with resolving my issue AND talked down to me. I now understand why so many people are switching. @comcast has the WORST reps i have ever delt with.
1228253805428404225 2020-02-14 04:45:01 EDT <iKolbyyy> That‚Äôs ong I swear the first half of the month I can‚Äôt even play Bc there‚Äôs so much outages in my area
1228226693187293185 2020-02-14 02:57:17 EDT <SendITBass> Ah yes, time for my nightly internet outage. Thanks @Xfinity , this doesn‚Äôt get annoying at all.
1228187305833197568 2020-02-14 00:20:46 EDT <Jenomous> Looks like @xfinity has an outage in Alexandria, VA. Been out for over 15 minutes now. Wi-Fi is very intermittent at any given time. Well so much for midnight tv.
1228185181699203072 2020-02-14 00:12:20 EDT <WRECKERMAN_1> @Xfinity why have I had so many outages and "system maintenance" days this month? #ridiculous #hopeigetacredit #XFINITY #annoying
1228170989801857025 2020-02-13 23:15:56 EDT <ohheydarb8355> I don‚Äôt know, at this point I‚Äôd just take something that works? My service has gone down (but don‚Äôt worry, no outages in the area) at least 3 or 4 times this month. And we are only halfway through. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1228168464797323266 2020-02-13 23:05:54 EDT <pilarhari> You missed the point entirely. I wanted to watch it THEN because I had the time. Also, are you sure about it being an outage in my area? My profile isn‚Äôt indicative of my home town/viewing area.
1228162581832990726 2020-02-13 22:42:32 EDT <rachiehg> @Xfinity is one of the worst companies. 3 outages in 2 days. Can't talk to anyone about something other than an account. Should be showing a nationality televised hockey game on NBCSN but instead showing a stupid car auction show.
1228158148562698240 2020-02-13 22:24:55 EDT <AlexReteguin11> I think it‚Äôs been happening since Tuesday the outage
1228127969580683264 2020-02-13 20:25:00 EDT <AlexReteguin11> Dear @comcast @Xfinity this outage is starting to piss me off fix it
1228083457328402437 2020-02-13 17:28:07 EDT <Xfinity> Hi, do you notice you are in an area-wide outage when this happens? If it's not an area-wide outage our digital support team can pull up your account here:  https://xfin.tv/support¬† üëà

1227992799435509760 2020-02-13 11:27:53 EDT <Xfinity> Are you in an area outage? What does your My Account app say about the status of your internet?
1227984326131953664 2020-02-13 10:54:12 EDT <RyanBohac> Chicago is anyone experiencing WiFi issues with @Xfinity right now? No reported outages but my internet isn‚Äôt working

1227942685786374145 2020-02-13 08:08:45 EDT <readingmatters1> There has been no outage. We have a broken cable. It has been this way for months, with promises to fix it. Nothing ever happens. Thank you for responding. Terry Verduin, Jupiter, Florida.
1227901823098523648 2020-02-13 05:26:22 EDT <eaphen> Xfinity has way too many outages
1227839817909583872 2020-02-13 01:19:59 EDT <thehub81> Power outage according to twitter page
1227837081264611328 2020-02-13 01:09:06 EDT <bryand85> I read that they had a power outage or something
1227778224773619713 2020-02-12 21:15:14 EDT <jpTheSmithe> Nice thing about an Xfinity outage: no garbage television glaring in the cardio room
1227764473584287744 2020-02-12 20:20:35 EDT <CC_Midg3t> @xfinity @comcast you suck. Why do I pay you monthly to have consistent service outages? #annoyed
1227756752512462849 2020-02-12 19:49:55 EDT <MacGregorga> Hey @Xfinity , is there a cable outage at 2221 I Street, Washington, DC?  Internet working but both cable boxes out.
1227747726198218752 2020-02-12 19:14:03 EDT <Aldbarnes67> #xfinity #comcastoutage these outages are costing me serious work time and data usage on my phone.  #saline #Michigan
1227713924163874818 2020-02-12 16:59:43 EDT <WISEWIZARD777> @Xfinity @comcast  Frequent Local outages are costing time, money, and safety to all customers. This has to stop please. #comcastoutage
1227713896103993349 2020-02-12 16:59:37 EDT <HulkDad79> We‚Äôre currently experiencing an Xfinity outage & Verizon data coverage is weak. I CAN‚ÄôT EVEN GIF RIGHT NOW!!!! I‚Äôm not sure how much longer I‚Äôll be able to last. It‚Äôs been nice knowing you all... #TheEndIsNear
1227710421647450112 2020-02-12 16:45:48 EDT <jss1113> Yet another total @Xfinity service outage. I‚Äôm beginning to think that my old 110 baud acoustic coupler would be more reliable... except my local landline is ALSO having issues. #Grumpy
1227700923419545603 2020-02-12 16:08:04 EDT <aamark6969> @comcast @Xfinity I hadDIRECTV for 3 years and not one outage. I have had Comcast for 2 months and we have had several outages. Right now to and won‚Äôt be fixed until 8pm
1227699273317388289 2020-02-12 16:01:30 EDT <taralynn87> @comcastcares @Xfinity internet outage in SE MI?! Awesome right during my online coursework... ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Any ETA of restoration?!
1227698843871055875 2020-02-12 15:59:48 EDT <mafiretones> @Xfinity These outages are happening too frequently. We had one cvs just a week or so ago and now we have another today.
1227696427125673990 2020-02-12 15:50:12 EDT <MGT1275> It started Thursday or Friday of last week.  At one point my app indicated an outage but I would think it would be corrected by now.  As for the wifi is used for the internet and one cable box, not sure on the security system.
1227657419070857216 2020-02-12 13:15:12 EDT <ogvek> wow didnt even know you could do that lol, guess there is an outage. thanks for the help, my bad about coming at yall like thatüíÄ
1227631825805365249 2020-02-12 11:33:30 EDT <AshleyBurns1020> @Xfinity experiencing an outage for the past few hours
1227588610477740032 2020-02-12 08:41:46 EDT <Iron_Lr> I already chatted with an agent last night. Outage map shows ‚ùóÔ∏èin some parts around me but not mine. Technician is supposed to come out on Friday but I don‚Äôt see any reason on my end as to why my internet should be acting like this.
1227588106481741826 2020-02-12 08:39:46 EDT <Xfinity> What's going on? Check the Xfinity My Account app first to see if there was maintenance or an outage in your area.
1227542093398265857 2020-02-12 05:36:56 EDT <lovelenahampton> Look like it's time for my monthly @Xfinity internet outage. A technician was here less than a month ago to replace the modem. You can't even tell me if there's an outage or let me log into my account. This is ridiculous. I'm about done. Where's that @metronetfiber door hanger? pic.twitter.com/07dfagW0Ng
1227539442686201858 2020-02-12 05:26:24 EDT <lovelenahampton> I'm having similar issues. Internet isn't working, can't log in,  and can't check if there are outages in my area.  pic.twitter.com/O1xx98j0YK
1227464189188374529 2020-02-12 00:27:22 EDT <jrock_nole> @Xfinity always performing scheduled maintenance outages. I‚Äôm curious what type of maintenance bc my services have been working perfectly fine lol  pic.twitter.com/ugzohgxbLF

1227345834678702080 2020-02-11 16:37:04 EDT <JacobJoyGames1> @Xfinity your service is terrible, you should be ashamed of how often there is an outage.
1227338698473328640 2020-02-11 16:08:43 EDT <ItsThuggaBabyyy> Xfinity Got A Outage In My AreaüôÑüöÆ. Bastards
1227336015607746562 2020-02-11 15:58:03 EDT <hk_lilly> @comcastcares I am trying to get assistance about intermittent WiFi outages on xfinity router Comcast account. When using website to schedule callback, it‚Äôs just a big loop with no help offered. Frustrating.
1227314070044409858 2020-02-11 14:30:51 EDT <popist_kt> @Xfinity Seattle outage: fixed when?

1227297247072788487 2020-02-11 13:24:00 EDT <mamajo76> Some type of outage that apparently won‚Äôt be fixed until after 5pm
1227290977745768448 2020-02-11 12:59:05 EDT <BebeDuarte> @Xfinity 3rd day of outage. No one can tell us when it will be back up. No phone, TV, or Internet service. I think we deserve more than we are working on it and will send you a text when its up again. FRUSTRATING for someone who works from home!
1227281878287253505 2020-02-11 12:22:56 EDT <bethfrye29> One minute @Xfinity says there's an outage in my area and now there's not. Think y'all are full of crap

1227271062855069697 2020-02-11 11:39:57 EDT <Xfinity> Are you in an area outage?
1227258842733367296 2020-02-11 10:51:24 EDT <rachcodes> Me: I‚Äôm gonna get up and be super productive today  @Xfinity: Take this 5 hour+ outage with zero knowledge of when it will be back up    Guess who‚Äôs going for a run? Not me but I‚Äôm certainly gonna walk this nature trail. Maybe I‚Äôll run. Big maybe. üòÇüòÇ
1227254080784830464 2020-02-11 10:32:28 EDT <Athoughtsoup> I just got off the phone with Comcast. They told me 10am (for Kent, WA). That makes today the 5th outage in about a week and the longest outage. So far, February has been the least reliable month for Comcast. Apparently the technician(s) who know what they're doing quit.
1227234340096151552 2020-02-11 09:14:02 EDT <Xfinity> We can help with the internet issues! Do you know if there was an outage in your area?

1227024810322153480 2020-02-10 19:21:26 EDT <carlaLOVEScrack> xfinity always with a damn outage

1226956459101032449 2020-02-10 14:49:50 EDT <JusteMoi7x> @Xfinity @comcastcares Stop with the freaking internet outages already!!! üò° It is constantly happening. Working from home and can‚Äôt get my work done! üò° How about you pay a penalty for failing to provide adequate service? üò° #scam #fraud #comcast #xfinity
1226946345971273728 2020-02-10 14:09:39 EDT <daniellesublett> @Xfinity @comcastcares no word on the 3 day #outage in Oakland?
1226935749246881792 2020-02-10 13:27:32 EDT <Xfinity> What's going on that you're offline? Is your gateway disconnecting or is your area experiencing an outage?
1226920036536868866 2020-02-10 12:25:06 EDT <dalsondecap> Well the internet outage was fixed. I got a 10 dollar credit to the bill after losing 100 dollars that day in hourly pay and getting an attendance point. I work in customer service and I think that‚Äôs terrible. But that‚Äôs just me. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1226864378093408258 2020-02-10 08:43:56 EDT <Xfinity> This isn't the expectation we want you to have of us. You can send our Digital Care Team a DM:  https://xfin.tv/support¬† - and we can credit you due to the outage.
1226755748723478528 2020-02-10 01:32:17 EDT <ms_tlovee> I saw none of the Oscars thanks to @Xfinity and their outage. üò°
1226728150777774081 2020-02-09 23:42:37 EDT <davidfarinella> Anyone know why @Xfinity @comcastcares is out in Oakland? Can‚Äôt find a reason for such a huge outage.
1226727409208066048 2020-02-09 23:39:40 EDT <PrinceGhuman248> @Xfinity what's the official word on the internet outage in Oakland, CA?
1226696055888068609 2020-02-09 21:35:05 EDT <otiffy> internet outage all day. issue will be resolved by 2/12!? that's 3 days away... why @Xfinity. i expect to be credited for this down time. üò© wasting data on @xfinitymobile too because of this, ugh. #xfinitysucks
1226692405564444677 2020-02-09 21:20:34 EDT <TN_hnybdgr> @xfinity it has now been 24 hours in SE TN with no internet, no TV??? Are you crediting our bills for this outage? Just pushed service back time to 12:16AM.
1226686064007536641 2020-02-09 20:55:23 EDT <lbaccus_poetry> @Xfinity @comcast @comcastcares  I just finished a chat with a great customer service rep.  However, my service has been down since 0554 this am & is still in outage. I wfh & need service restored for work tomorrow. Please? Thank you! (We have  never had an outage last this long)
1226685381812244480 2020-02-09 20:52:40 EDT <mthiara5> @Xfinity @comcast there's still a friggin internet outage in my area #xfinity sucks balls
1226685363009343488 2020-02-09 20:52:35 EDT <Rgrasshopper> Use the chat with agent option. We encountered the same with calling service center. Still no service. Outage since 0554 this am.  "Engineers are aware & working to resolve"
1226684761424506881 2020-02-09 20:50:12 EDT <Rgrasshopper> @Xfinity @comcast @comcastcares  I just finished a chat with a great customer service rep.  However, my service has been down since 0554 this am & is still in outage. I wfh & need service restored for work tomorrow. Please? Thank you! (We have  never had an outage last this long)
1226678629045821440 2020-02-09 20:25:50 EDT <daniellesublett> @Xfinity your reps confirmed there would be a 3 day outage in Oakland affecting over 1000 customers but could give no further info on cause?
1226670068542533633 2020-02-09 19:51:49 EDT <ms_tlovee> The power is back, but Xfinity has an outage. Sighhh
1226666440637501440 2020-02-09 19:37:24 EDT <JokerOfTheNorth> I‚Äôve been having issues with xfinity since the other week. We have 1g up and down and we have been getting really bad lag spikes/ outages lately.
1226631613699776519 2020-02-09 17:19:01 EDT <Xfinity> Hi, I just want to verify-are your services in San Jose, and is your MyAccount app reporting an outage?
1226625462232735745 2020-02-09 16:54:34 EDT <seabiscuit7> @Xfinity @comcast @Comcastcares Just had entire city have full outage...tried to call as did neighbors...."We are aware....and an agent won't be able to help you further." Never allowed us to talk to you all...that is wrong #Comcast.  Tell the higher ups.  It has been restored
1226621831496339456 2020-02-09 16:40:08 EDT <jamesofur> I gotta love the @Xfinity outage maps/notes where every hour the 3ish hour estimated time frame just gets pushed back by another hour. First it‚Äôs by 3:30, then 4:30, then 5:30. So we have a 6:30?!  pic.twitter.com/MwrHmfNrsx
1226556496684748803 2020-02-09 12:20:31 EDT <ohheydarb8355> @Xfinity not to mention today is the second time this week that our service has gone down. But, they refuse to acknowledge a service outage in our area ever. So I‚Äôm paying more for less. Fix this @Xfinity or I‚Äôll go somewhere else.
1226554455916777472 2020-02-09 12:12:25 EDT <ImRyke> @Xfinity y‚Äôall trying to hurry up with this damn internet outage in west Michigan it‚Äôs been 2 damn hours.
1226343017440849921 2020-02-08 22:12:14 EDT <erinleeryan> Tonight : oh, comcrap says there's no outage, but how convenient that no one with @xfinity has service. Between this and removing Starz from the package I pay for for Outlander, I hope Ting gets here soon so I can drop @comcastcares that didn't even give me my gift card üòê
1226302250680823809 2020-02-08 19:30:14 EDT <TheBretMunson> Another unexplained @Xfinity @comcast outage.  #routine
1226253742225461249 2020-02-08 16:17:29 EDT <XvJericovX> Having a major internet outage in my area, hope they get it fixed soon! @Xfinity Will start stream when I know it is stable!
1226209172112343040 2020-02-08 13:20:23 EDT <YaSimuse> Bet...guess I have to wait for this ‚Äúpower outage‚Äù to be over

1225990008240140288 2020-02-07 22:49:30 EDT <HawksCougs> @Xfinity outages in 98338?
1225980079005716480 2020-02-07 22:10:03 EDT <kjccreates> Found the outage map! No outages in our area. We're stuck on the last channel we were watching before the problem. Every time the show goes to commercial, it plays the same 5 second snippet of a commercial over & over. Can't change channels either.
1225978917951021058 2020-02-07 22:05:26 EDT <kjccreates> Downloaded, installed, & logged into the app. Couldn't find anything like a local outage report. Started troubleshooting via the Xfinity Assistant & it's rebooting a "gateway."
1225973620654170112 2020-02-07 21:44:23 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked your My Account app to see if you're in an area outage?
1225953535453487105 2020-02-07 20:24:34 EDT <Xfinity> Are you in an area outage?
1225948460882518016 2020-02-07 20:04:24 EDT <kreepsymusics> Stated on your website that TV outage would be resolved at 7:43 PM --it isn't. How long do you expect TV outage to last? @Xfinity
1225940234237599744 2020-02-07 19:31:43 EDT <Xfinity> Hmm. Have you checked the MyAccount app to see if there is an outage in the area?
1225932384249565184 2020-02-07 19:00:31 EDT <Xfinity> Are you in an area outage?
1225927268108787714 2020-02-07 18:40:12 EDT <NursesrulePeggy> @comcast @Xfinity who knew that it would be impossible to report a downed wire running across the road that a high vehicle could get caught up on. Stupid automated call center center tells me that they know there is an outage in the area. Let‚Äôs hope this doesn‚Äôt cause a crash

I can't call out...calls last about 7 seconds-long enough for me to confirm phone number then nothing. There's no message indicating outage. internet/tv work. Mobile pmt$ is auto

1225854331452194816 2020-02-07 13:50:22 EDT <mrsmedsss> Xfinity has ANOTHER outage today until 2pm (estimated) for tv AND internet. Like wtf is the point of y‚Äôall then? I need to switch services ASAP I‚Äôm so over this.

1225783181317754881 2020-02-07 09:07:39 EDT <lasky525> @Xfinity we don‚Äôt have internet connection in our office and we were told it is an East Coast outage. Trying to get confirmation. We need to work!
1225779671301640192 2020-02-07 08:53:42 EDT <HaseldenSean> I can‚Äôt even pull up the status map now to check and see if my issue is part of the same outage. The @Xfinity account section  isn‚Äôt fully loading (over lte since my service is down)
1225778261461999617 2020-02-07 08:48:06 EDT <Xfinity> Is there an outage reported? Track that through the Xfinity My Account app or use this site:  https://comca.st/2H1L14B¬† for updates and information.
1225754257154023424 2020-02-07 07:12:42 EDT <Troopakoopa240> I asked them to check the Nods and Circuits on the poles by my house, there was a recent outage two weeks ago an it has been on going internet issues.

1225047681577508865 2020-02-05 08:25:02 EDT <Dcoleworld> Wish I had another reliable internet service. I'd drop Xfinity in a heartbeat. $100 for 100 mbps ain't it. Prices went up twice and there's an outage like every other week
1225046058855567363 2020-02-05 08:18:35 EDT <DizKraze> Yes. Let's remove the device that will protect all your investments from mass destruction in the event of a power outage. Next on "What's It Worth to YOU?"
1225045006316199943 2020-02-05 08:14:24 EDT <Dcoleworld> I feel like I pay Xfinity way too much for this slow internet that always has outages
1225043954753769472 2020-02-05 08:10:13 EDT <aubietiger1928> @Xfinity so uh maybe stop saying the outage will be fixed by a certain time when it‚Äôs not even close to be fixed‚Ä¶
1224944997449064465 2020-02-05 01:37:00 EDT <XaSOSA901> @Xfinity is getting cancelled,overpriced as it is, but always upping fees and now want to charge for Starz that was already included. I'm not paying another $1 more for a hit or miss service quality always a outage or slow "high speed internet"
1224937581500162048 2020-02-05 01:07:32 EDT <iamweeza> Xfinity would have an outage right now while I‚Äôm doing my homework smh
1224899706872127494 2020-02-04 22:37:02 EDT <GroggyBuTWoke> @Xfinity So glad we can depend on your consistent outages. Maybe direct tv is in my future
1224899041919631360 2020-02-04 22:34:23 EDT <GroggyBuTWoke> @Xfinity Sure would be nice if your services worked. I mean its not like your customers don't have things to do. Guesss a refund for the outage is out of the question
1224896173498085377 2020-02-04 22:22:59 EDT <PUPFILMS> .@Xfinity stop with the outages every god damn weeküò≠üò≠
1224851369183465472 2020-02-04 19:24:57 EDT <KCChronister> @Xfinity why the monthly outages in my area???
1224836452472717314 2020-02-04 18:25:41 EDT <Xfinity> Does it say whether you're in an area outage? Have you tried restarting your gateway?
1224834074243731457 2020-02-04 18:16:14 EDT <tommy07397968> can you just fix the outage in little egg harbor? wifis been down for 5 hours
1224833481659711488 2020-02-04 18:13:52 EDT <ebrls60> @Xfinity internet outage all afternoon with a 6:00pm possible fix ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è that‚Äôs almost a 5 hour outage
1224818157677879298 2020-02-04 17:12:59 EDT <Xfinity> We can help with your bill due to any outages you had. Send our Digital Care Team a DM:  https://xfin.tv/support¬† <----
1224807528241852417 2020-02-04 16:30:45 EDT <SouthSoundShane> Power outage and PSE takes care of t within the hour. Xfinity meanwhile expects to restore internet in four hours...
1224793765052911617 2020-02-04 15:36:03 EDT <ReggieThayil> Keep complaining publicly. I ended having a supervisor show up without me asking for 1 and he determined they needed 2 upgrade all the lines at no cost 2 me. Now my only issues are related to major outages like when a construction crew cut the main line for the entire area I'm in
1224782240154079232 2020-02-04 14:50:16 EDT <_TruNaturalista> @Xfinity is down in my apartment, so I‚Äôm having to work from home using my hotspot and it‚Äôs a mess. Please get this fixed ASAP! Over 1000 ppl are affected by this ridiculous outage!
1224772731528470533 2020-02-04 14:12:29 EDT <Kristen_Sellars> You know you‚Äôre an @Xfinity customer when internet outages become a weekly occurrence. @comcast @comcastcares ...worst company ever
1224751350854180867 2020-02-04 12:47:31 EDT <alienrendel> #comcastoutage @xfinity @comcast - Full service outage in Chicago for hours in the middle of the day on a Tuesday and your 800# tells me it's "scheduled maintenance"? I call bs.
1224710356435656704 2020-02-04 10:04:37 EDT <senpaisquish> This is my second time working from home this past month with Xfinity having an outage...
1224701533306195970 2020-02-04 09:29:34 EDT <topherlytle> I want to give a shout out to @Xfinity .  They have been super helpful for me today and even though I will probably have to go to a different internet service, I want to say thanks.  Besides a few outages, they have been great.
1224654784705257473 2020-02-04 06:23:48 EDT <dnice1101> @Xfinity @comcastcares going on 24 hours of an outage. If it‚Äôs not fixed this morning I will be canceling my service
1224654474494349312 2020-02-04 06:22:34 EDT <ogre1500> @comcastcares @comcast @Xfinity Stop fucking around with my service! Every time you do an update, I have to hard reset all my equipment and even then I'm out of service for an extended period of time. Outage once again! And because you're a monopoly, you don't have to care.
1224545892251897856 2020-02-03 23:11:06 EDT <jeap89> @Xfinity here we go again. Another unexplained outage in my area. But don‚Äôt worry, I can purchase on demand internet? What kind of sick joke is this???  pic.twitter.com/JlxPUIYny7
1224529835927592961 2020-02-03 22:07:18 EDT <tatted_bby> I really fucking hate Xfinity and their shitty ass internet outages
1224527833361502209 2020-02-03 21:59:20 EDT <BenBteg> @Xfinity 3 hours of messaging and still won‚Äôt let me TALK to someone about service outage. Customer service is nonexistent with xfinity. Cancelling service in the morning. Never seen service this bad, and I work for an airline,  so that really means something.
1224519832181379074 2020-02-03 21:27:33 EDT <jackeyxoxo131> yes, another area outage for the night. second night in a row, and when I call customer service it says yall are experiencing higher than normal call volume and to call back later üòí
1224516833845370880 2020-02-03 21:15:38 EDT <03jayhawks> @Xfinity outage 66061????? C‚Äômon!!!!
1224501262655336449 2020-02-03 20:13:45 EDT <Xfinity> We can help. Are you in an area outage?
1224486827777761280 2020-02-03 19:16:24 EDT <Xfinity> Check your My Account app to see if you're in an area outage. The app will also provide updates if that's the case!
1224486218743844865 2020-02-03 19:13:59 EDT <LisaAnnRiddle> @Xfinity is there an outage in the Atlanta area???
1224476692543967237 2020-02-03 18:36:07 EDT <MirSter22> @Xfinity there‚Äôs an internet outage in my area Denver 80209 1st said fixed by 3:45. Now says 7:30 mt. Will it def be fixed by 7:30??
1224464159334494208 2020-02-03 17:46:19 EDT <eachus> Comcast/Xfinity?  Depends on where you are, I think.  Here, there are too many outages for my taste. But I think some of them are intentional, for example often being down for a while at 3 am. Probably maintenance.  But sometimes daytime too. I had a brief outage this morning.
1224460993855619073 2020-02-03 17:33:44 EDT <Xfinity> Are you in an area outage?
1224441121218027522 2020-02-03 16:14:46 EDT <LynnePena75> Especially since there‚Äôs a major Xfinity outage here.
1224439101538963464 2020-02-03 16:06:45 EDT <resistasistah> Then, I find out from a former customer of yours that the daily outages are a feature of your service.  Your internet service is horrible too. If I try to have more than one page open at a time, I have to wait for the page to re-load before I can switch pages. Horrible service.
1224438678841245696 2020-02-03 16:05:04 EDT <resistasistah> Sure you do!  LOL I've already spoken with 3 different "supposed" tech support people and have gotten NO HELP. With the price increase, they blame the government and fees. With the daily outages, they say I cannot get support while my service is OUT. That makes no sense.
1224425984180359168 2020-02-03 15:14:38 EDT <resistasistah> Beware of taking out service with @comcast @Xfinity  My second month under contract they raised my price, but that's not the worst part.  I have outages every day and when I call for help (they make it nearly impossible to speak to a real person,) (1)
1224412452286353408 2020-02-03 14:20:51 EDT <Stephh_Dixon> Hey @Xfinity are we just gonna have an outage every single time it snows? This is ridiculous, never using Xfinity again üôÉ
1224380615098761217 2020-02-03 12:14:21 EDT <OldHeathcliff> Unexpected internet outage. ü§¨ I'll try to get back to it as soon as I can.  @Xfinity fix your $#!+!!!  Is it possible that you could let your customers know ahead of time when you're doing "scheduled maintenance"?  (Sooooooo much self-censoring here!)
1224206918022942720 2020-02-03 00:44:08 EDT <Atticus182880> @Xfinity y‚Äôall need to get it together, this is the 2nd outage this week.
1224170103987720192 2020-02-02 22:17:51 EDT <doomtree87> @Xfinity you guys successfully ruined my Super bowl party with this outage in my area
1224164062570909696 2020-02-02 21:53:51 EDT <jchiodo43> In the other coast, but spectrum/twc had outages earlier too. Idk if it's related or not.  .
1224141061255131137 2020-02-02 20:22:27 EDT <TheKeithZen> And even though @Xfinity says there are no outages in the area... reset the modem and router... and the direct LAN connect is also not working. So pretty sure all that‚Äôs left is you guys :-/
1224126798797119489 2020-02-02 19:25:46 EDT <N4BFR> Second @Xfinity outage of the night.   I guess there was an interception?  Went to the bedroom with my antenna. #SuperBowl pic.twitter.com/hQYguJzj7S
1224103889944756226 2020-02-02 17:54:44 EDT <tha1jonjon> @Xfinity I've been with Xfinity for a year now. I have had non-stop outages, speed drops, and repeated tech visits and still the issue persists.. I've been paying you for 1GBPS and most of the time I get 90MBPS... You make sure you take every penny every month though.
1224102109936787456 2020-02-02 17:47:40 EDT <Xfinity> What's going on with your internet? Are you in an outage?
1224095785865711616 2020-02-02 17:22:32 EDT <They_Call_Me_7> Yes, it says there‚Äôs an outage in my area.
1224094897411588097 2020-02-02 17:19:00 EDT <Xfinity> We can help. Are you seeing yourself in an area outage in your My Account app?
1224093664319877120 2020-02-02 17:14:06 EDT <Xfinity> We can help out with your internet issues. Have you been in any area outages during this time?
1224092131561803777 2020-02-02 17:08:01 EDT <Xfinity> We can help. Are you seeing an area outage showing in your Xfinity My Account App?
1224091649460047872 2020-02-02 17:06:06 EDT <OGTweetsDog> @Xfinity Who else knew we‚Äôd have an Internet outage on Super Bowl Sunday, raise your hand üñê Another fine job by worse internet and TV provider in America. Good thing we still have our AM radio, we‚Äôll probably get less interruptions and a better signal. Break out the tinfoil, ma!
1224086863255830530 2020-02-02 16:47:05 EDT <blassey> There's probably never a great time for @Xfinity to have an outage, but Superbowl Sunday has to rank up there with the worst options.
1224086731017924610 2020-02-02 16:46:33 EDT <Xfinity> Have you looked into your My Account app and seeing an outage in your area?
1224086208533475328 2020-02-02 16:44:29 EDT <N4BFR> The dreaded cable oops.   Less than 2 hours until kickoff and there is an outage in my area.  @Xfinity #SuperBowl pic.twitter.com/t6mjxhFHAn
1224060616001720320 2020-02-02 15:02:47 EDT <aristeordiaz> @Xfinity Outage before the SB 80923
1224057488573595648 2020-02-02 14:50:21 EDT <1825_Tulane> How about fixing the outage in my area instead of making stupid tweets
1224035953926230016 2020-02-02 13:24:47 EDT <JoshBenson_PDX> #SuperBowl2020 wouldn‚Äôt be complete without an @Xfinity outage. Certainly cutting it close with that ‚Äúresolved‚Äù time estimate. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  pic.twitter.com/x676Olh4n7
1224016283890569216 2020-02-02 12:06:37 EDT <SwaggBoyBam> Bro Xfinity has an outage right now wtf ü§¨üò§
1223989890838335489 2020-02-02 10:21:45 EDT <tamphilli4> @Xfinity how do you have an outage on Super Bowl Sunday!!??
1223984282261168135 2020-02-02 09:59:28 EDT <AMOURCHAR> And I dnt understand how there‚Äôs always an outage. I call @Xfinity and you can‚Äôt provide any details on how your gonna credit my account for everything being completely out!
1223867069420072961 2020-02-02 02:13:42 EDT <bennetyee> .@Xfinity outage. Now my @LIFX smart lights are idiot lights. They used to work when phone is just on the same network, but "improvements" for server control/automaton now require always on internet. Enough to make me want to buy dumb lightbulbs.
1223847761394618375 2020-02-02 00:56:58 EDT <kylemoonsgirl> @Xfinity once again! I‚Äôm definitely switching to @dish #outage #xfinityoutage #xfinitysucks!
1223794378596143110 2020-02-01 21:24:51 EDT <JohnnyYewwwtah> @comcastcares my xfinity wifi has been out of service all day. There is a service outage in my area of Nashville. When is this going to get fixed?
1223746290586091520 2020-02-01 18:13:46 EDT <MIsForMerkin> Just 2 weeks since I had to leave @googlefiber for @Xfinity bc I moved, and I‚Äôm experiencing my first internet outage! At least I‚Äôm paying 50% more for slower speeds, less reliable service, and a data cap.
1223725736055447552 2020-02-01 16:52:05 EDT <adamfortman> Hey @Xfinity! I've had more service outages since moving to Texas (just over 2 years) than I did when I was in Michigan (11 years)! What's up with that?! Would love to be reimbursed for all these outages, too.
1223701583311052805 2020-02-01 15:16:07 EDT <PappasChristy> Yo @Xfinity y‚Äôall wanna like, send a text or something next time to let us know when we‚Äôll have an outage because of maintenance?
1223586339595194368 2020-02-01 07:38:11 EDT <ACB_1219> @Xfinity power outage in my neighborhood and apparently won‚Äôt be fixed until 8ish #CST do they know what it‚Äôs like for a toddler not to be able to watch Cocomelon ü§¨ #FirstWorldProblems
1223470203046178816 2020-01-31 23:56:42 EDT <UTTuck24> @Xfinity 6 hours and counting outage in Robertson County, TN. Let‚Äôs step it up.
1223467857251618816 2020-01-31 23:47:22 EDT <apaininthetech> #Comcast charges me for overages so can I charge them for #outages?  My Friday night is shot!  Thanks #xfinity!  @Uverse can you please work on getting GB speeds in White House, TN!
1223431188515315712 2020-01-31 21:21:40 EDT <tiffanybmorris> Hey @Xfinity @comcast @comcastcares what‚Äôs with this outage and why is it taking so long to fix?! You have a lot of unhappy customers right now in my town.
1223430999951978496 2020-01-31 21:20:55 EDT <Rewritehell> F**k @Xfinity! Two outages in one day. Daily occurrences of the modem needing to reset, plus this means the television component is down, too.  $269 a month for this?  #reliability
1223430423520403457 2020-01-31 21:18:37 EDT <drushotya> Welp. Xfinity service outage at the crib. So much for watching this Lakers game......*grabs keys*
1223420655061946370 2020-01-31 20:39:48 EDT <msfashdesigner> Soooo this just happened... SMH I am sooo annoyed with xfinity who knows when this outage is going to be fixed! Sorry Family we were having so much fun with our Crazy Hospital SMH ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  pic.twitter.com/com4eU35c9
1223416219417612289 2020-01-31 20:22:11 EDT <__savvyleigh> If there is one thing I can count on with @Xfinity ....is weekly outages for 5+ hours....
1223406890694201344 2020-01-31 19:45:07 EDT <Andrew_White5> I've read what I can get, $3 a day. Considering the amount of outages and issues we have, that's a slap in the face. I've reached out, but I have no faith in your company to make anything right.
1223404486338715648 2020-01-31 19:35:33 EDT <Andrew_White5> No they wont, it's a service outage in my area and there's nothing a tech can do per your automated system. Time start refunding some funds because quite frankly, we aren't getting anywhere close to what we pay for. I'm on the phone with ATT praying the offer service in my area.
1223401213854724097 2020-01-31 19:22:33 EDT <himynameis_jon> Update @Xfinity I was told to call back whenever I experience a service outage and I‚Äôll get my day refunded. Since I‚Äôve only called twice I get $6. So when I call back tomorrow I‚Äôll get $9.
1223391361526726658 2020-01-31 18:43:24 EDT <jakehasler> CenturyLink has been surprisingly awesome for me. Almost 3 years at consistently $45/month for 80Mb. No caps, and just one weird outage that I can remember. Not the fastest but pretty tough to beat in my book.
1223356251230363648 2020-01-31 16:23:53 EDT <borja_burgos> With @Xfinity you need to turn it off, and turn it back on 3 days later, after the outage has been resolved.
1223271629746245633 2020-01-31 10:47:38 EDT <DJ_Shecky> Must be some major issue with @Xfinity in my area. The outage that started this morning has its fix ETA increased to two more hours. That would put it at around 5-6 hours of downtime for people.
1223249950391328769 2020-01-31 09:21:29 EDT <iFiddleDeeDee> ‚ÄúAn xfinity agent cannot help you until the outage in your area is resolved. Thank you for calling xfinity. Goodbye.‚Äù So now I can‚Äôt even speak with customer service when I need to? And I thought directv was awful! Y‚Äôall take the cake.
1223184692561596418 2020-01-31 05:02:11 EDT <DarkYoshi19> Sorry yoshi crew, I have an internet outage from 2am to 5am, damn Xfinity. I appreciate all the support Yoshi crew, ya'll the realest üòâ i'll be back sometime in the morning üëç

1223121899770671105 2020-01-31 00:52:40 EDT <JudithSherwin> @Xfinity outages in Rogers Park

1223010091793776641 2020-01-30 17:28:22 EDT <ffshifflett> Pa-COMCAST (XFINITY) is experiencing an outage in the Greencastle (Southern Franklin PA area).  According to Comcast:  We're working hard to get your service up and running. The issue will be resolved 01/30/2020 06:16 PM (Eastern). Thank you for your patience.
1222954359610318850 2020-01-30 13:46:55 EDT <olive_panda> Xfinity knew I couldn‚Äôt get off Destiny so they decided to have an outage mid strike. Nice üòí
1222953240259694592 2020-01-30 13:42:28 EDT <Xfinity> We know these outages have been frustrating. We're working to get this fixed ASAP.
1222946894571286529 2020-01-30 13:17:15 EDT <Wilbot2000> #xfinityoutage There seems to be outages happening in Houston right now. Very frustrating. The xfinity app keeps reeling me that there‚Äôs a problem with my modem when I know that‚Äôs not true.
1222945461146935296 2020-01-30 13:11:33 EDT <sramosec> @Xfinity what's up with all the outages in NW Indiana? This is the 3rd day in a row!
1222923809562529795 2020-01-30 11:45:31 EDT <Melissa_H_Chi> #Xfinity outage in Chicago. They should pay my salary for every hour I can‚Äôt work. These outages are too often and too long.
1222922856524320769 2020-01-30 11:41:44 EDT <Melissa_H_Chi> I‚Äôm regretting my decision to switch to @Xfinity about 3 months ago. There‚Äôs another outage in my area today. As a work from home person I rely on the internet to do my job and they are causing me to get behind. Hopefully it‚Äôs back up in time for my meeting. #xfinityoutage
1222908440298708992 2020-01-30 10:44:27 EDT <ToreyJonesYT> @xfinity @comcastcares Is there an outage in the Vancouver, WA area? Internet hasnt worked for 10 hours or so ...
1222892560387100672 2020-01-30 09:41:21 EDT <Xfinity> Ok, use this link:  https://comca.st/38SCVY0¬† to start troubleshooting. Also be sure to check the Xfinity My Account app for outage or scheculed maintenance updates.
1222851581013422081 2020-01-30 06:58:31 EDT <royzzz> @comcastcares @Xfinity your outage status page is not loading so I need you to give  me an update on how long this outage will last on Portland Oregon.
1222835342149083142 2020-01-30 05:53:59 EDT <a_dix83> @Xfinity would love an update on when you plan to address this outage in my area.  pic.twitter.com/qRW6OrYaQW
1222734025225310211 2020-01-29 23:11:23 EDT <MrBrianSimmons> Was so excited to have dinner and catch up on shows with my gf on the only night in the month we have together. Unfortunately, @Xfinity decided service isn‚Äôt provided on the 29th day in January. Thanks for the 5 hour and counting outage!
1222718242998947841 2020-01-29 22:08:40 EDT <beomsnyangi> There ARE reported outages here, but the issue is... Why the fuck is xfinity wifi working, but not the internet on my modem? I don't know if he booted the modem off the account or if there's an issue with it internally, or if it's just an issue with Comcast WIRED connections.
1222690171218468865 2020-01-29 20:17:07 EDT <MLYJumpeR> AYEEEE we love @Xfinity @comcastcares   There has been 3 outages in the last week. This is actually frustrating asf   Looks like I‚Äôm moving to Colorado  https://twitter.com/MLYJumpeR/status/1222688986549964805¬†‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/K7G7MxWNWr

1222645449418510336 2020-01-29 17:19:25 EDT <RGuajardo18> Yes, there is an outage. Can I set up a text alert so y‚Äôall can alert me when it‚Äôs back up?
1222619923635167237 2020-01-29 15:37:59 EDT <hrishirao> @comcastcares @Xfinity another outage in Chicago suburbs in less than a week? #internetoutage #comcast #outage #comtage ??
1222615258679869453 2020-01-29 15:19:27 EDT <Xfinity> Check the Xfinity My Account app for updates on maintenance or outages.
1222605926739456000 2020-01-29 14:42:22 EDT <emilyweberwood> @comcastcares Is the Internet outage I'm seeing in Doylestown PA so bad that it's also affecting the open Xfinity wifi network too? Usually I can jump on that when my wifi is down but not today.
1222605383723712512 2020-01-29 14:40:13 EDT <cb_smithdahl> Slow connections and frequent outages from @Xfinity @comcast in #WestOakland over the past month. Supporting #smallbusinesses and #lowincome folks includes making sure your regular internet service is consistent.
1222590931238621184 2020-01-29 13:42:47 EDT <DonaBeverly> @Xfinity any idea when the outage in the 77040 zip area in Houston, TX gonna b fixed? I work from home. I‚Äôm essentially dead in the water w no wifi. Thx!
1222571490928885767 2020-01-29 12:25:32 EDT <Jeffbizzle> @Xfinity what‚Äôs up with all the network outages? We gonna have to get some credits going, can‚Äôt work when internet keeps going out
1222561607768776705 2020-01-29 11:46:16 EDT <GrellyBeans> @Xfinity there must be a big outage though because from the looks of it so many people are reporting problems throughout the country
1222560520051609601 2020-01-29 11:41:56 EDT <GrellyBeans> @Xfinity my internet is out is there an outage in Connecticut?
1222554813218598914 2020-01-29 11:19:16 EDT <Xfinity> Hey what's going on with your internet; are you in an area-wide outage?
1222521902314422272 2020-01-29 09:08:29 EDT <happyaloy> @Xfinity @comcast so when are you guys going to fix this outage? i havent been able to do any work in the last 5 days. i pay you guys almost 200 dollars. i'm barely getting 1mbps for speed and it keeps going in and out. FIX THIS.
1222509658356830208 2020-01-29 08:19:50 EDT <clofwhoville> Ugh - sorry to hear it. I've usually gone hunting for a cafe with service when I've had to ride out outages in C'Port, but I know sometimes the work you're doing doesn't really allow for that. Hope it's back up soon. Service is fine over here in C'Port & Flour has a fireplace.
1222376688677421057 2020-01-28 23:31:27 EDT <fightforoleDC> @comcastcares @Xfinity   Awful, this is like the 3rd outage in the last 2 weeks or so and today's been hit or miss all day to boot
1222353205759180801 2020-01-28 21:58:09 EDT <PatheticGirl_22> This outage is making me lose my mind @Xfinity
1222350692825759745 2020-01-28 21:48:10 EDT <chrisdreagan> Why do I suspect you never have a computer outage when you are processing my payment each month?
1222350121540694016 2020-01-28 21:45:53 EDT <Xfinity> We don't want this to continue. We can take a deeper look into your area to see what's causing these outages. Send us a DM:  https://xfin.tv/support¬† <--
1222348467823095809 2020-01-28 21:39:19 EDT <himynameis_jon> @Xfinity Really needs to figure out their service in Davie. The only ISP I‚Äôve used that has outages at least once a day. I‚Äôm stuck with this for 2 years?...
1222345198887493633 2020-01-28 21:26:20 EDT <ugottapaytoplay> @Xfinity I spend over $220 a month on your bullshit internet and television service and at least twice a week there is an outage for hrs at a time

This is happening on a regular basis, several times last week and twice now this week! My Xfinity app stating that there is an outage in my area.

1222164200748994560 2020-01-28 09:27:06 EDT <jemolney> I've been waiting to get a response from @comcastcares for a phone outage for almost 12 hours in Maryland.  I sent them a DM, and no one has responded to that either!! #ComcastFailure #Xfinity
1222161423142457344 2020-01-28 09:16:04 EDT <waiiveurn> My one last bit of good mood before roasting someone on the phone at Xfinity for my outages.  pic.twitter.com/hGJOvSaFXz
1222154285481451520 2020-01-28 08:47:42 EDT <jemolney> YES, the services are STILL DOWN.  I've been told it is an "area outage" but that doesn't answer my concerns!  My Mom has a LIFELINE that depends on her HOME PHONE!
1222043310933663749 2020-01-28 01:26:44 EDT <kencom420> @comcastcares @Xfinity Care to get your shit together? I'm baffled by the number of recent outages here in Northern Virginia. Soon it'll be a national pastime watching the 5GHz light blink as it fails to connect.

Also, how can you expect people to be without internet for two whole days. you need to hire more techs or need to make outages priority
1221239238412378112 2020-01-25 20:11:38 EDT <pshin> @comcastcares @Xfinity  Been out of internet all day. Outage resolution time keeps pushing back later and later. When will this actually be fixed?

1221193052095688705 2020-01-25 17:08:06 EDT <Nicki_Simone94> So not only do we have an @Xfinity outage in the area, we also have no electricity and it‚Äôs been like this for almost 12 hours @MyBGE  We‚Äôve had more electricity problems since we moved at the end of 2018. I understand sometimes more trees causes more issues but it‚Äôs been a mess.
1221192112835874817 2020-01-25 17:04:23 EDT <KulStoryBr0> @Xfinity @comcastcares No internet for an entire day, and the second outage in three days. What's going on here?

1221134346960166913 2020-01-25 13:14:50 EDT <vanme8443> @xfinity outage in my area not ok
1221129968668807168 2020-01-25 12:57:26 EDT <EliHershkovich> Hey, @Xfinity. No more internet outages on Saturdays. Tysm.
1221127689597120512 2020-01-25 12:48:23 EDT <DaveLack> Not sure which is more frustrating.   No internet at all so @Xfinity HAS to acknowledge and fix the problem, or whatever this is that has been happening the last 3 days where Xfinity claims there is no outage on my map yet everything runs at 1990 dialup speed.
1221117629684994053 2020-01-25 12:08:24 EDT <On441LikeWaves> @Xfinity's customer service reps are actually good, but the company itself will outage you weekly, jack up your bill and take channels away gleefully. I really, really, hate the company, much as I love their reps. Pity to give "valued customers" the shaft like that.

Bet @verizonfios isn‚Äôt out right now, maybe we‚Äôll go with them next time. #creditplease pic.twitter.com/REXwpw2bz9
1221098302374137857 2020-01-25 10:51:36 EDT <joseloyola1686> There is a national outage. They are offline.
1221095189030342656 2020-01-25 10:39:14 EDT <QuingKayo> Can‚Äôt watch my tv, play my Xbox or shit cuz @comcast @Xfinity got an outage in the area! Y‚Äôall know I better get a credit for this inconvenience
1221086222447185923 2020-01-25 10:03:36 EDT <emberkkk> Kingston told me we were gonna watch ‚ÄúFlippy‚Äù so I thought, ‚Äúa show where people do awesome flips? Dope.‚Äù Turns out he was saying ‚ÄúBlippi‚Äù so @Xfinity if y‚Äôall could go ahead and have another outage
1221085808196714497 2020-01-25 10:01:58 EDT <SirDinoHelm> Starting the weekend off with a @Xfinity outage in my areaüò¶ So I should be seeing you guys before 430pmüôå Let's hope they get it fixed fast
1220902140723396610 2020-01-24 21:52:08 EDT <DaelunGaming> Anything Comcast (Spectrum, Xfinity, etc) is going to have garbage DNS servers, moreso the past few days with their national DNS outage. Try switching to OpenDNS servers and you will probably see improvement. I got a few streamers up yesterday that way
1220899572957859842 2020-01-24 21:41:56 EDT <_Payks> Hardwired but there‚Äôs another outage in my area. This shits been off since 4:00

1220809626343690240 2020-01-24 15:44:31 EDT <JoNathanVol77> They are both crap! They sell you inferior technology solutions at a premium. I intentionally moved to an area with gig Fiber run by a smaller company with awesome service. 0 outages in the past 763 days.
1220780327838388226 2020-01-24 13:48:05 EDT <Xfinity> Are you in an area outage?

This morning, no internet. "No outages in your area, restart..." /me checks internet. "Nationwide Xfinity outage"  /me shakes fist at Xfinity  Brilliance.

1220585934074400768 2020-01-24 00:55:38 EDT <XeroxCopycat> If its comcast/ Xfinity, check your connections. They had a big outage earlier today.
1220543714378027008 2020-01-23 22:07:52 EDT <ginalou> Actually, I like them. It's super rare that there's ever an outage like today's. I honestly don't have any complaints. I know that's rare, but it's true. And RCN isn't any cheaper.
1220538890303373312 2020-01-23 21:48:42 EDT <chrisorourke> Dear @Xfinity having the same 20 hour outage in SE #pdx every single time it rains is entirely your fault.   Sincerely,  Competent network infrastructure engineers.
1220530552769601537 2020-01-23 21:15:34 EDT <aerysten> Yep, it‚Äôs the same here in terms of cable. Only outage that was listed was Cedar Bluff
1220523089185783808 2020-01-23 20:45:55 EDT <maggi_mae> @Xfinity @comcast @comcastcares is the internet outage impacting TV? Kinda want to vegg and watch some ABC!
1220512653396676608 2020-01-23 20:04:27 EDT <sweet_cheri_pie> Hey @Xfinity...what‚Äôs up with the outage? It was working fine all day while I was working, but now that I want to veg out and watch some tv, you wanna go out üôÑ #thisisBOOTY
1220511326071427073 2020-01-23 19:59:10 EDT <cometumor> @Xfinity why is there an outage? What happened?
1220505668823601154 2020-01-23 19:36:42 EDT <Chappah> @comcast @Xfinity outages are news? Seems like mine is out every morning at certain times!    https://www.mystateline.com/news/local-news/comcast-xfinity-experiencing-nationwide-outage/¬†‚Ä¶
1220501074509029378 2020-01-23 19:18:26 EDT <bsniz> Hilarious that the @Xfinity app doesn't let you take screenshots of outage maps for "security policy" reasons.
1220494950988570626 2020-01-23 18:54:06 EDT <RaginVolCANO> @Xfinity hey when is the internet outage over? The internet in our house has been down all day with no updates

1220491178271002624 2020-01-23 18:39:07 EDT <MistaRafik> @comcastcares @Xfinity @comcast 6 days of TV outage and no eta of repair. No communication or apology from Xfinity. @verizonfios what a big loss that you are not in IL! I miss having a reliable TV/Internet provider. 3 years with Fios and no issues at all.
1220488170334310401 2020-01-23 18:27:10 EDT <JKSuperTrooper1> Do you have xfinity? Cause my friend has it and shown where a bunch of outages across the nation
1220474609801318400 2020-01-23 17:33:16 EDT <wemeow2> Was there an Xfinity outage?
1220469391680143360 2020-01-23 17:12:32 EDT <epochnesss> I dont say this word much, but i HATE @Xfinity with a burning passion. These outages and errors are non-stop.  pic.twitter.com/7zRpk1Ul8p
1220468633626914816 2020-01-23 17:09:32 EDT <TrailJunky22> @xfinity Internet Outage!  Its seems your service is degrading, without a way to escalate.  Monthly discounts are not enough anymore!
1220467084846485505 2020-01-23 17:03:22 EDT <davidnburgess> I get there and the the guy checking people in had the personality of a dead earthworm. After waiting for a while I called the local number for Xfinity only to find out that there was an outage in the area. I'm REALLY unhappy with my service lately.
1220467030182129664 2020-01-23 17:03:09 EDT <toowitttolegit> Because they can control the outage?
1220465552445136897 2020-01-23 16:57:17 EDT <jonny290> Today's @Xfinity outage undoubtedly will be answered with a stock price bump tomorrow due to their thriftiness  pic.twitter.com/9EgQ7XtmL4
1220463854511181824 2020-01-23 16:50:32 EDT <BillyGoat2798> Xfinity had nationwide outage earlier maybe that‚Äôs affecting it
1220462685751513096 2020-01-23 16:45:54 EDT <RenaeIRL> I've been having internet issues all day. I guess there's been a massive Xfinity outage everywhere but it hasn't quite stabilized for us yet. Will stream as soon as I think we're good and won't drop stream over and over!
1220461671715692545 2020-01-23 16:41:52 EDT <d3VINN> Got a new computer and OF COURSE @Xfinity had a nationwide outage  pic.twitter.com/BSuw76ZYQh

1220456003067699204 2020-01-23 16:19:20 EDT <andman0832> @comcastcares @Xfinity so 48 hours from now is your current estimate for outage in my area to be fixed?!  Here‚Äôs my request for a credit then (ha yeah right!) since customer service is unreachable.

1220452609976340480 2020-01-23 16:05:51 EDT <DetroitIllinois> So there seems to be an xfinity outage and I'm guessing that half of the people complaining aren't the ones who are paying. #Mommy #Daddy It'll all work out when Xfinity and Comcast provide refunds for the outage.
1220452210091462656 2020-01-23 16:04:16 EDT <Dave90643419> @Xfinity won‚Äôt even acknowledge the outage lol

1220443415428718600 2020-01-23 15:29:19 EDT <n8dom> Honestly, as much as I hate Comcast, Xfinity has been really reliable lately. I rarely experience outages.
1220443276609826816 2020-01-23 15:28:46 EDT <OldTownCards> Is the US being cyber attacked right now?   I lost internet which is Xfinity/Comcast and my Verizon is slow af on my phone.

1220439681499791360 2020-01-23 15:14:29 EDT <MiamiSeda> Exactly. We've had so many outages since Sept and I've literally had to beg online for help keeping it on this month since I work from home. I remember Adelphia always gave us a credit when their internet would go down for more than an hour.
1220439521046777857 2020-01-23 15:13:51 EDT <MsBeckyBrooks> what is up with the outage and nobody can access any apps or their account? @comcastcares @comcast @Xfinity

1220438924637745153 2020-01-23 15:11:28 EDT <StuartJolly> @Xfinity can you acknowledge you have a nationwide outage as network is down and account access is blocked.

Finally managed to pull up the service area map. Said there was no outage in our area, but that 501-1000 customers in my area were experiencing service ‚Äúinterruptions‚Äù (1/2)
1220438196066115584 2020-01-23 15:08:35 EDT <astonishingjack> This full blown @Xfinity outage won‚Äôt even let me report an outage

1220437822341029889 2020-01-23 15:07:06 EDT <JMile305> @Xfinity My account app, website account info, and your phone aren‚Äôt working. We‚Äôve got an outage in the Seattle area. What gives?
1220437741441355778 2020-01-23 15:06:46 EDT <TwonThymes> @comcastcares @Xfinity So what happened in the U.S. just now? Is anyone on your end going to talk about the outage? Does @comcast really "Care"?

1220437175457734657 2020-01-23 15:04:31 EDT <XeroxCopycat> Looks like @xfinity starting to come back up again after that outage. Finally getting back to most sites. Probably a DNS routing issue.
1220437080049881089 2020-01-23 15:04:09 EDT <Ashton_Welsh> Anyone experiencing outages, change your DNS server address to 8.8.8.8. It will fix it for now. If you don‚Äôt know how, google it. @Xfinity @comcast

1220436924118204417 2020-01-23 15:03:31 EDT <SteveRothaus> It appears @Xfinity is experiencing a national outage. Along with national outrage.
1220436922117566470 2020-01-23 15:03:31 EDT <marklarforever> Is there a nation wide outage? I cant call your support number is a busy signal?? Your messing up my work!!!

1220436463038365696 2020-01-23 15:01:42 EDT <JustOzzy82> I hope the nation wide xfinity outage isn't a national security problem.
1220436439571234816 2020-01-23 15:01:36 EDT <TracyDeLopez> So, if you have #comcast #xfinity apparently there's a nationwide outage.  pic.twitter.com/wAnHaX2O8R
1220436418708852737 2020-01-23 15:01:31 EDT <DavidCarrino> Same here. Comcast or Xfinity  charges me up the ass, but doesn't care that my work is affected. How many more outages will I get this week?

1220435333944352779 2020-01-23 14:57:12 EDT <TheCodySkinner> Comcast/Xfinity DNS servers appear to be having issues. You can use the Google DNS servers at 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 if you're having issues  #DNS #Xfinity #Comcast #Outage

1220435028615868416 2020-01-23 14:56:00 EDT <ZeroShadesOfJay> Why haven‚Äôt you guys made an announcement post about the outage instead of acting clueless under every reply?
1220435025625329664 2020-01-23 14:55:59 EDT <OutstandingSDW_> Congrats Xfinity, you've managed to knock out 21,000 home networks with either a massive outage or faulty gateway update.

1220433337426288640 2020-01-23 14:49:16 EDT <SterlingCBeard> @comcastcares Is there an outage in the Arlington, VA area? Everything went down and my Xfinity app can't log me in on 4G
1220433314454089728 2020-01-23 14:49:11 EDT <angelquiroz1212> Welp just time to wait until the xfinity outage is over üôÑ
1220433255243165698 2020-01-23 14:48:57 EDT <Dillpicklz> I think Xfinity is completely dead. Tweets about outages from everywhere and their website is down
1220433158245703680 2020-01-23 14:48:34 EDT <Benson_Elliot> @Xfinity is there an outage or something?
1220433135839727619 2020-01-23 14:48:28 EDT <JimmyTheDunn> Apparently this @Xfinity outage is so bad that their outage map and service center are completely unavailable. Have to wonder if this is something larger
1220433085302439938 2020-01-23 14:48:16 EDT <Moggula_> Wow nationwide xfinity outage ? Vex is a understatement üò≠
1220433076943192065 2020-01-23 14:48:14 EDT <yousuuuuuuuuuck> Can‚Äôt exactly work from home #wfh without internet. ‚ÄúNo outages in your area‚Äù ...but right down the road there‚Äôs an outage. Once again, @comcast @Xfinity, #yousuck.
1220433010455126016 2020-01-23 14:47:58 EDT <MelMcB23> Internet outage in south jersey. What's going on @Xfinity?
1220432961042030594 2020-01-23 14:47:47 EDT <CarDestroyer1> @Xfinity outage in Orlando WTH...
1220432930633388039 2020-01-23 14:47:39 EDT <m4ttbit> @Xfinity Lost all internet at my house. Logged into My Account app to check the status. Not available. Tried to do customer support call back. Not available. Tried to check outage map. Not available. No support page is available. I'm guessing something's gone terribly wrong.
1220432715385909248 2020-01-23 14:46:48 EDT <mikeaguilarjr> @Xfinity fix your wifi - Dawsonville, Georgia is down - shitty I pay this money for outage after outage - only reason I‚Äôm with you is my apartments have contract - FIX IT
1220432647106842626 2020-01-23 14:46:32 EDT <chelkweber> @RocketFiber please expand down Jefferson üôèüèª had to switch to @Xfinity and I have an outage monthly

1220432361495629824 2020-01-23 14:45:24 EDT <smryan08> Any outages @Xfinity ? Outside of boston area and my internet on my laptop isnt working, and my roku isnt either
1220432255497179141 2020-01-23 14:44:58 EDT <RyanBohac> @Xfinity are we experiencing internet outages in Chicago? My service has been in and out (and now completely out) all day.
1220432240536182790 2020-01-23 14:44:55 EDT <HeAboutMadge> @Xfinity is there an outage in the DC area ???? I need to get work done!!!!! What an inconvenience!
1220432052643946496 2020-01-23 14:44:10 EDT <aprilataylor> Yet another #comcastoutage here in #MetroDetroit. Can‚Äôt even get the service app to load, and the outage map is down too. Please fix this, @comcast @Xfinity
1220431826310893575 2020-01-23 14:43:16 EDT <imshvrk> @Xfinity goes down in my area, lists no outages, and you can‚Äôt even call in to get a status? What gives, guys? Is this what I pay you for?!
1220408020615802880 2020-01-23 13:08:40 EDT <imayra21> @Xfinity a technician has been at my house since 8:30 this morning.  Still no service, no word on when the "outage" will be fixed.  #NotAGoodLook
1220405592394817537 2020-01-23 12:59:01 EDT <imayra21> @Xfinity what is wrong with the service in DC? Is there an outage?
1220389031328067591 2020-01-23 11:53:13 EDT <himynameis_jon> My weekly #XFinity outage is here. What reliable service! ü§ó  pic.twitter.com/GrE2ZhJw0E
1220381542276616192 2020-01-23 11:23:27 EDT <jmcolli> @Xfinity I‚Äôm really over all the internet outages and slow internet when it is working!  We pay too much money for it to keep happening way too frequently!  üò°üò°üò°üò°
1220381256485089281 2020-01-23 11:22:19 EDT <32Reith> Had techs out by me for an outage last week we talked for a while and they both said separately Feb 20th. Well see.
1220367428086943744 2020-01-23 10:27:22 EDT <jonam_indus> I have an outage too. Its a widespread outage in San Jose. Not just for individuals. Crazy.
1220351737510297600 2020-01-23 09:25:01 EDT <RealTurboman> Good morning!  Hoping to stream later today assuming Xfinity outage is resolved by then..still no internet for me since last night üôè
1220347128263790592 2020-01-23 09:06:42 EDT <dbertauche> @comcastcares San Jose @Xfinity outage since 9pm Wednesday...what's the status of getting things up and running?
1220295465427554304 2020-01-23 05:41:25 EDT <LilJaysin76> Stay at @ATT at least you‚Äôll have service instead of an outage every other day. Like shitty xfinity
1220234230732673024 2020-01-23 01:38:06 EDT <bennybeats_> Hey @Xfinity every single night between 1-2 my internet shuts off.   It says a routine maintenance but also says an ‚Äúunplanned outage.‚Äù Which one is it? Can my internet not get shut off every night? Honestly terrible service and any time I can I get no help at all.  pic.twitter.com/h5UHazpgHj
1220233053320241153 2020-01-23 01:33:25 EDT <Mr_DRP> Three outages in 24 hours with 4-5 hour resolution times? Great work @Xfinity
1220225251616808960 2020-01-23 01:02:25 EDT <SmartedPAnda> After spending 40 troubleshooting my own damn internet. @Xfinity / @comcast finally tells me it's on their end. @comcastcares have an outage map like every other company.
1220223175989944321 2020-01-23 00:54:10 EDT <LilJaysin76> @Xfinity y‚Äôall could be half decent people and at least post where the outage areas are instead of lying on the app
1220207191879311361 2020-01-22 23:50:39 EDT <ChavezRB6> @Xfinity your app had me playing with my modem for  40 minutes because it said there wasnt an outage in my area. Then I check downdector and see that there is a large spike of reported issues in my area. I would like my 40 minutes back...
1220199344726511616 2020-01-22 23:19:28 EDT <drwaterski> @xfinity is the WORST! 2 days of on/off outages and still not resolved... and of course they are not going to refund 2 days of service fees. @comcastcares is ironic... because they don‚Äôt! pic.twitter.com/nlFcD79hzz
1220191953591185408 2020-01-22 22:50:06 EDT <valagnew1023> Second @comcast @Xfinity outage in as many days   No one has been paid this much to suck this bad since Tim Tebow played football
1220184454947274752 2020-01-22 22:20:18 EDT <Clecoes> @comcastcares @Xfinity Any updates on the outage in Illinois?! -Signed, Mr. Fed Up!
1220183634491080706 2020-01-22 22:17:03 EDT <bcgaden> Yet another @Xfinity outage here in Bucktown... it‚Äôs getting ridiculous
1220166643348885504 2020-01-22 21:09:32 EDT <GarrasOso> Ive heard so much horrible shit about spectrum over the years that i dont think id touch it with a 10ft pole at this point im on xfinity currently and ive never had any outage or problems at all
1220161561416867844 2020-01-22 20:49:20 EDT <Latinovichh> @Xfinity GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER  3 OUTAGES IN THE PAST 2 WEEKS FUCK YOU
1220156610548523008 2020-01-22 20:29:40 EDT <PushPlayTheDJ> So @Xfinity let me know what‚Äôs good??? 3 outages 3 minutes from each other
1220144601656446981 2020-01-22 19:41:56 EDT <seajay4600> No outages in area per app.  This happens at least 1-2 times a week.  Sometimes the reset button does the trick and sometimes we have to wait for it to com back on its own.  Extremely frustrating Sign of a bad router?
1220141391331975168 2020-01-22 19:29:11 EDT <diastiss> @ATTSportsNetSW channel not working through xfinity stream app in Dickinson texas. Is there an outage? Your channel is the only one affected
1220138184266473476 2020-01-22 19:16:26 EDT <seajay4600> @Xfinity WiFi is down.  Located in south jersey.  I am assume there is an outage???
1220127155692154884 2020-01-22 18:32:37 EDT <luv4randb1231> Thankfully the #XFinity outage was short lived. Not sure it's back 100%, as things seem to be running a little slow, but at least I have connection.
1220120994934853634 2020-01-22 18:08:08 EDT <tat2girl> @Xfinity what's with all the outages this week?!
1220117869314355200 2020-01-22 17:55:43 EDT <gworrellstyle> Honestly I paid almost 200 per month with no premium ch. there have been outages- 2 repair guys out to my home with no knowledge of the problem! Each time I call I‚Äôm routed to a call out of the country with a person neither n knowledge! At this point some one should be calling me
1220111322479833097 2020-01-22 17:29:42 EDT <sshreck22> Ah, the annual @Xfinity outage. I love it.
1220110465604317185 2020-01-22 17:26:18 EDT <sjworkingmom> So @Xfinity @comcastcares internet outage in my area.  Your outage map has conflicting info.  One thing says it was a planned outage for ‚Äúroutine system maintenance‚Äù but another part says it‚Äôs unplanned.  So which is it? And when will it be back up?  I have work to do.
1220108377835089921 2020-01-22 17:18:00 EDT <luv4randb1231> Ah, the joys of technology. Apparently, #XFinity has an outage in my area. No internet, phone, or TV for me until it's fixed. Thank goodness I at least have unlimited data on my phone.
1220081097620574213 2020-01-22 15:29:36 EDT <mymaxie> @Xfinity here is a novel thought for a telecom co. When there there are techs working in the area and WiFi is going to be disabled or when there is a planned outage why not notify customers ahead of time? Would seem simple enough to do & foster customer goodwill!!!!!
1220074166017196037 2020-01-22 15:02:03 EDT <hrishirao> @comcastcares @Xfinity is there any update? It‚Äôs getting close to 12 hrs of outage. Your outage page doesn‚Äôt provide any additional details either
1220067910238003202 2020-01-22 14:37:12 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Tracy, are you in a service outage according to the My Account app?
1220039104227880962 2020-01-22 12:42:44 EDT <Xfinity> The best way to stay up do date with any possible outage info is by using your My Account App.
1220008223677321216 2020-01-22 10:40:01 EDT <Xfinity> Are you in an area outage?
1219998246711562240 2020-01-22 10:00:23 EDT <ToriMeyer47> In the middle of coding a damn claim and xfinity goes ‚Äúthere‚Äôs an outage in your area, you will not be able to access anything until it is restored‚Äù COOL
1219996141779066880 2020-01-22 09:52:01 EDT <AnneM24> @Xfinity I'm trying to find out when the outage will start in my area but fell down the rabbit hole when calling you and only managed to get my modem reset even though I kept answering no to the "reset modem?" question. Please help!
1219977797206265856 2020-01-22 08:39:07 EDT <Xfinity> We know this is frustrating. We appreciate your feedback on this outage situation.
1219973183962525696 2020-01-22 08:20:47 EDT <clayton__knight> Nothing like waking up to the second major .@xfinity outage in 5 days. Nothing like telling google to turn off my alarm and hearing "we can't reach the internet right now..." which means lights downstairs didn't come on, coffee wasn't made, and it's 10 deg cooler downstairs.
1219964736076382209 2020-01-22 07:47:13 EDT <hrishirao> @Xfinity @comcast service is down in #chicago northwest suburbs for over 4 hrs. When is the service expected to be restored? Your outage website doesn‚Äôt provide much info.
1219912615738200065 2020-01-22 04:20:07 EDT <garjen99> @comcast @Xfinity almost gave me a heart attack tonight making me think we were overdrawn.  Telling me we were cut off due to nonpayment.  Then I learn that outages were reported for my area and that it was not cut off...ASSHOLES...FUCK YOU SO THOROUGHLY
1219877467239997440 2020-01-22 02:00:27 EDT <skimmylatte> .@Xfinity internet outage in Alexandria VA zip 22312 What‚Äôs going on? Status?? #xfinityoutage
1219781266633039872 2020-01-21 19:38:11 EDT <MakeupByEvette> @Xfinity  what‚Äôs up with outages? Like no cable al day?
1219751629530042368 2020-01-21 17:40:25 EDT <SarahPHL_> Considering how much I pay for @Xfinity every month, the amount of outages is almost as high as my bill!
1219750171090788353 2020-01-21 17:34:37 EDT <jjl_ice_yard> @comcast @Xfinity @comcastcares Services outage in the area (60618)  since before Noon. Initially told it would be restored by 2:45. Now saying 6:39 (seems oddly precise). Project sunk and plans to DVR Illini basketball threatened. What gives? 1/31 refund coming?
1219746592552554496 2020-01-21 17:20:24 EDT <bunsofbread> Thanks for the outage, @Xfinity. I didn't want to play @PlayTemtem tonight anyway.
1219738841101279232 2020-01-21 16:49:36 EDT <Xfinity> You can check the status of the outage through the Xfinity My Accout app or go to:  https://comca.st/2RdkHdM¬†
1219738626155778053 2020-01-21 16:48:44 EDT <pawzprint> How long will the outage in Central City, KY last this time @Xfinity ? You raised rates again but cannot provide reliable service
1219710355083026432 2020-01-21 14:56:24 EDT <webster_tech> Working from home is so much more difficult when @comcastcares has an outage. I've had no internet since before 10 AM. The first update said it would be fixed by 1:35, but here I am - still without internet. What gives, guys? #comcast #xfinity #comcastoutage
1219664506906927104 2020-01-21 11:54:13 EDT <terrellwilson42> @Xfinity another outage in two days get your shit together

1219537192080404481 2020-01-21 03:28:19 EDT <Ms_Tj080184> @Xfinity I just want to know how many more outages do I have to continue to experience in my area this becoming very disappointing frustrating and inconvenience. It‚Äôs been over a month of this and it‚Äôs unacceptable. What‚Äôs the point of paying for service that doesn‚Äôt work?
1219534937490984960 2020-01-21 03:19:21 EDT <deifrankone> Should I expect to see a credit on my account every week now? I will always ask for one every outage so ... Is this the new trend from you all @comcastcares @comcast @Xfinity ? üòíüò†ü§¨üò§
1219534303446519808 2020-01-21 03:16:50 EDT <deifrankone> 13 days after this outage ... Another one occurs! Thanks @Xfinity @comcastcares  your service is so trash that it's gone out 2x in one month! https://twitter.com/deifrankone/status/1215140882417995777¬†‚Ä¶
1219525450600534018 2020-01-21 02:41:39 EDT <alexhawk_x3> Came home from work and my internet is down thanks to an ‚Äúoutage‚Äù in my area. Thank you xfinity for shitting on the rest of my night.. atleast I paid you for fucking something üòë
1219503965446066176 2020-01-21 01:16:17 EDT <SasakiJustin> Why does @Xfinity have so many outages in my area bro üòî i literally pay $100 a month for good internet to always be disappointed. Outrageous.
1219468334598709248 2020-01-20 22:54:42 EDT <Draxxx15> Hey @comcast @Xfinity I pay a lot of money to get your best internet, and you literally have an outage from morning to night in my area, whilst having a ton of work, I just wanna let you guys know im going to switch providers when my contract ends, and you can fuck yourselves.
1219459156622692352 2020-01-20 22:18:14 EDT <Kaityx333> ok @comcast @Xfinity this outage is getting ridiculous y‚Äôall suck
1219449933796913152 2020-01-20 21:41:35 EDT <skumnick> @xfinity, what does one need to do to get internet service that doesn‚Äôt drop/have reported outages, multiple times, on a regular basis?
1219425855744761856 2020-01-20 20:05:54 EDT <de_chanchan> @Xfinity we are getting random disconnects of our internet service. Is there an outage right now?
1219417407959240704 2020-01-20 19:32:20 EDT <LivingWitness87> @Xfinity killin me with these outages üòíü§¨
1219416957268611072 2020-01-20 19:30:32 EDT <DeannaGifford> There are no words to explain how angry I am getting with this garbage Comcast Xfinity service.. Months worth of intermittent outages and one day after the latest tech replaced my cable box this is today  pic.twitter.com/oozWqFTx8m
1219365142271594496 2020-01-20 16:04:39 EDT <MrsMarMan> After all the complaining I tried to do to @RockstarGames about Red Dead online and when I finally think shit is fixed and it's nothing but animals around and I finally get to start shooting some bucks in the head again... Here come fuxking @Xfinity with a damn outage...  pic.twitter.com/d1ZXiKf650
1219342924581949443 2020-01-20 14:36:22 EDT <tsmcnair1993> So @stuartkmcnair, did we go two whole weeks without a @comcast @Xfinity service outage? Countdown starts over again today.
1219327072612405250 2020-01-20 13:33:22 EDT <MrRichardWeaver> Eagerly waiting for the @TMobile 600MHz expansion in Carnation WA. Especially when dealing with @Comcast @Xfinity outages.
1219321092671557632 2020-01-20 13:09:37 EDT <US_Patriot_SF> @comcast @comcastcares @Xfinity This is day 5 in a row in my neighborhood that you've had an hour or longer outage. What the heck? This is getting really annoying and @DIRECTV is looking pretty good about now.
1219316862800089089 2020-01-20 12:52:48 EDT <CLuskus> @Xfinity @comcastcares Internet has MAJOR packet loss! Makes the internet unusable for my purposes!!!!! Your website says no outages in my area but CLEARLY there's an issue on your end (Diagnosed everything on my end and its fine)
1219303870985273347 2020-01-20 12:01:11 EDT <Domitrov1Janeen> Xfinity outage in KNOXVILLE, TN?
1219256396862103552 2020-01-20 08:52:32 EDT <BlondHousewife> For me, the big winner last night was @XFinity. For having a complete outage before the AFC Championship game was over and lasting until after midnight. After raising our monthly bill yet again. Great job boys, now jam the local airwaves about how customer service is your goal.
1219104823250997248 2020-01-19 22:50:14 EDT <AnaPhylaxis721> Hey #XFINITY! What‚Äôs the average credit you issue for lack of service? Just ballpark. Or is there actually NO CREDIT FOR A SERVICE OUTAGE?!?! ü§îü§îü§îü§î
1219103274395148288 2020-01-19 22:44:05 EDT <AnaPhylaxis721> Hey @Xfinity! AMAZING how you only admit to a service outage once you get caught! AMAZING how I can sign in to chat w/ a rep yet the rep demands ALL my account info. Like, same info I needed to sign in to chat w/a rep? ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I have no service & you OWE ME A CREDIT! Get a clue!!
1219096108384866304 2020-01-19 22:15:36 EDT <internude> there has been an internet outage in my area for a total of 24 hours now. yes i am using my moms 1gb of monthly data on her obama phone to hotspot to my phone to complain to xfinity to get a bill credit and to write this tweet  pic.twitter.com/KJNPvX6V9s
1219086706344898561 2020-01-19 21:38:14 EDT <AYEDATGURLBRI> I‚Äôm missing tv shows and Playoff games because of your outage problem are you kidding me but let the bill be late y‚Äôall ready to cut something off real quick  @Xfinity
1219077522673078273 2020-01-19 21:01:45 EDT <jamesdocjones1> Thanks @Xfinity for the outage during tonight‚Äôs playoffs
1219054861213425667 2020-01-19 19:31:42 EDT <SnarkyMushroom> Thanks @Xfinity for the service outage... great damn timing...
1219053930841329664 2020-01-19 19:28:00 EDT <darlingnikki_52> Second day of the ‚Äúoutage‚Äù @xfinity
1219041130018418688 2020-01-19 18:37:08 EDT <Eddie_Vietnam> Sure would‚Äôve been great to see the AFC Championship... too bad there‚Äôs been a cable outage for the past 5 hours.  Will I be able to see the next game at all @Xfinity??
1219039610359177226 2020-01-19 18:31:06 EDT <blekdiamonds> Can‚Äôt believe xfinity had this outage go on from early this morning until now.
1219031988168024064 2020-01-19 18:00:49 EDT <MyNameIsSir_> So uh, @comcastcares @Xfinity , massive instability and piss poor speeds and outages in Coon Rapids, MN I take it?
1219016694942851077 2020-01-19 17:00:02 EDT <ScarlettYoli> @Xfinity experiencing outage of  @CBS @NFLonCBS is not cool. When will this be resolved?
1219012499053277184 2020-01-19 16:43:22 EDT <deleon_mechi> @Xfinity be ruining Sunday football and vids with the guys. Unplanned outages blow. No service til 5 now
1219012242198401025 2020-01-19 16:42:21 EDT <DavidKaib> So apparently @Xfinity has an outage that means no sound on the channel the game is on that is scheduled to be fixed in four hours?
1218995185805332480 2020-01-19 15:34:34 EDT <Pens_Lynn> Yay for xfinity outages. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôÑ
1218968363419996165 2020-01-19 13:47:59 EDT <ReaGrover> This @Xfinity outage has me very frustrated! Im getting no planning done for the week and no TV.
1218945620993507328 2020-01-19 12:17:37 EDT <Allexandriia> Xfinity got an outage fml
1218941430590132229 2020-01-19 12:00:58 EDT <Bradie_101> Comcast was reporting an outage as well, but it was only Attsportsnet that wasn't working. Attsportsnet was working on Dish and Dirtecttv, so there is some mutual dysfunction between the Comcast and attsportsnet.
1218928488327020544 2020-01-19 11:09:32 EDT <IndyBlackGirl1> @Xfinity another outage in the 46224, 46214 zip code...just thought u should know. And on #Playoff Sunday!!? Get it together
1218647484202962944 2020-01-18 16:32:56 EDT <Spizzirri247> @Xfinity please check for outages in the 60051 area.
1218633893982756864 2020-01-18 15:38:56 EDT <stanradomski> @Xfinity Is anyone else dealing with an #Xfinity outage on their tv only. Error message XRE-00002. Set top box issue going on since Thursday afternoon. Still down and it‚Äôs Saturday.
1218632019199938560 2020-01-18 15:31:29 EDT <MikeCharlieGolf> @westseattleblog Looks like there is an Xfinity TV/Internet outage around the Junction. Confirmed as ‚Äúunplanned outage‚Äù in their app.
1218623197026955265 2020-01-18 14:56:25 EDT <bigbrainjuke> @Xfinity get your fucking shit together. we dont pay to have outages every month. I cant do my job today because of you guys. maybe you'll realize after the 10,000th tweet YOUR INTERNET SERVICE SUCKS DICK
1218545743386025984 2020-01-18 09:48:39 EDT <tobygh67> @Xfinity Experiencing outages in the Botanuc Lakes community, Fort Myers, FL 33913
1218430385975177216 2020-01-18 02:10:16 EDT <Sincereshy> You might have an outage
1218416968035962880 2020-01-18 01:16:56 EDT <sometimesoff> @Xfinity is there an outage in chicago
1218413390621577217 2020-01-18 01:02:44 EDT <spartankingv> Welp it turns out Xfinity has an outage
1218374342716903430 2020-01-17 22:27:34 EDT <RelUnrelated> @comcastcares It would be nice if future versions of your Xfinity app allowed customers to *report* an outage, rather than merely load a map that erroneously tells me there is no outage. Zip code 61802.
1218348472052658178 2020-01-17 20:44:46 EDT <beccavivian> I think it‚Äôs common knowledge that @Xfinity is AWFUL, but I cannot wait until Chris and I move to Colorado and we can get rid of this horrendous internet service. Outages EVERY week???? REALLY???
1218309401947205632 2020-01-17 18:09:31 EDT <rcummins64> What‚Äôs going on with the SB8200 firmware and the multi-day outage?   Why was a rollback not done to prevent further corruption?  When should we expect a fix?  @comcastcares @Xfinity
1218265948429352961 2020-01-17 15:16:51 EDT <MeatWagonBBQ> Of course @Xfinity @comcastcares has an #outage two minutes after I sit down at my desk. It‚Äôs been a whole entire two months since I‚Äôve had a outage. And I thought this time they got there #ShitTogether
1218263894898233355 2020-01-17 15:08:41 EDT <SS_Scrambler> @comcast @Xfinity yinz having an outage?
1218179995819966464 2020-01-17 09:35:18 EDT <Xfinity> Are you seeing an outage showing in your My Account App?
1218166082546143233 2020-01-17 08:40:01 EDT <comcast> Do you have the Xfinity My Account app? You'll be able to tell if there is maintenance happening, outages in the area or if the interruptions are specific to your equipment. -Gabbie
1218076335639269376 2020-01-17 02:43:23 EDT <joccywhite824> See I‚Äôd follow the steam if you guys didn‚Äôt always have fucking outages every two fucking seconds
1218072788721917952 2020-01-17 02:29:18 EDT <w0lfmilk> @Xfinity fix this unplanned outage I‚Äôm trying to stream the new @Eminem wtf get it together
1218051033412313088 2020-01-17 01:02:51 EDT <chrisObserved> Did you service go out completely now, as well? I was experiencing the same thing, now xfinity is showing an outage in my area and all services are down.
1218025654622412800 2020-01-16 23:22:00 EDT <Vafinesthp> @Xfinity hope my bill is prorated for this outage in Fairfield CA!!
1217984110641270784 2020-01-16 20:36:55 EDT <nnnyia> xfinity this is not the time to have an outage in the area !!!
1217979157759610881 2020-01-16 20:17:14 EDT <nrpzookie> Ok, seriously @Xfinity , that‚Äôs four internet and cable outages in the last 24 hrs. What the heck?!!
1217956501228269569 2020-01-16 18:47:13 EDT <Swasserific09> @Xfinity since it‚Äôs an outage in the area, will you all be crediting my account for this inconvenience
1217947627163017217 2020-01-16 18:11:57 EDT <CheckTheseNA> Good thing I streamed that smash direct today lmao An XFINITY Services outage has been reported in your area. We're working hard to get your service up and running. The issue will be resolved on 01/16/2020 11:18 PM (Mountain). Thank you for your patience.
1217849755650400256 2020-01-16 11:43:02 EDT <Xfinity> Are you in an area outage?
1217844404154748934 2020-01-16 11:21:47 EDT <lleytus> xfinity having outages in my area is just what i needed :( ugh

1217700642275254273 2020-01-16 01:50:31 EDT <Travanoid> Fuck Xfinity, but the GIGA-specific recovery time in their messaging amuses me greatly.  "An XFINITY Internet outage has been reported in your area... The issue will be resolved on 01/16/2020 02:28 AM."
1217675284285181952 2020-01-16 00:09:45 EDT <Falvey317> @comcastcares Xfinity outage in Happy Valley, Oregon?
1217660032445296640 2020-01-15 23:09:09 EDT <slsjr1> @comcastcares what's up with national outage SI040217868.  @ARRIS @Xfinity @comcast @ATT fiber looks better every minute and every hour this lasts. 3am to 11pm so far...  Hard to even get someone to acknowledge they have a problem!!!
1217623491249418241 2020-01-15 20:43:57 EDT <kelsey_burgess> How dare @Xfinity have an outage in my area when im trying to watch @CircleNetflix!?!?!
1217623036335132674 2020-01-15 20:42:08 EDT <Jsrunnlus> While unusual, today the service has seen more outages than functional. Might be up 30 minutes then out an hour.
1217592778718355459 2020-01-15 18:41:54 EDT <rachelkmcintyre> Xfinity service outage mid S1 Episode 5 üò≠
1217586011150176256 2020-01-15 18:15:01 EDT <chase314s> 2/2 - After a no-show, I contact customer support and am informed that my appointment was cancelled/put on hold with no one telling me because it was actually due to an outage. They could text me multiple confirmations but not inform me that they had cancelled my appointment?
1217585701182722049 2020-01-15 18:13:47 EDT <chase314s> For today's installment in Adventures with @comcast @Xfinity - I experienced an internet outage this AM - talked to multiple agents who ultimately determined it was an issue with my modem and scheduled an appointment for this afternoon. I take half a day at work to be here  1/2
1217580246356107270 2020-01-15 17:52:06 EDT <Xfinity> Check the Xfinity My Account app for outage or interruption information.
1217578459108560896 2020-01-15 17:45:00 EDT <iHateBooski> So I‚Äôm really getting pissed OFF @Xfinity ! 2nd day this is an outage in my area. All my cable boxes are out, Internet & phone are all unavailable
1217539064502480896 2020-01-15 15:08:28 EDT <johnpjoseph> Frustrating day- lots to do and @comcast / @Xfinity have an outage that they say will be resolved by 3:55. Guess I'll pull out the old file-o-fax and schedule some meetings that way.
1217511030198276096 2020-01-15 13:17:04 EDT <McmillanKathi> This has nothing to do with my equipment but instead either service outages in my area, 9which happen far too often), or contracted employees that have cut into my lines to install neighbors service.
1217503070411804672 2020-01-15 12:45:26 EDT <McmillanKathi> @Xfinity I cannot begin to tell you how frustrating it is to have this service and pay as much as I do and have consistent outages. I work, (when the internet is available) from home and have to hotspot far too often from my phone!!
1217494417604370433 2020-01-15 12:11:03 EDT <OfficeMonkey> I'm sorry, I already spent twenty minutes on Sunday on the automated system trying to get a human being only to be hung up on.  I did get a human by applying online, and the conclusion was "they're supposed to give 24 hour notice." I'll waste my time next time there's an outage.
1217486478454022144 2020-01-15 11:39:30 EDT <KingMikeBeon> Hey @Xfinity @comcastcares is there an outage? WiFi just dipped on me
1217481982214647808 2020-01-15 11:21:38 EDT <AmethystAmber87> #Xfinity always has outages but they want you to pay that bill on time. üòí
1217481202883387392 2020-01-15 11:18:33 EDT <anthonyikeda> @Xfinity Please tell me the 2 internet outages in the Mission/Dolores area of San Francisco in the last week are going to produce a new super speedy network connection upgrade for us all!  If not, Why????????? This impacts my job every time we have an outage.
1217463239912710145 2020-01-15 10:07:10 EDT <Xfinity> Hi there. If you think you're in an outage, check your My Account app for info and updates.
1217444980358373376 2020-01-15 08:54:37 EDT <MichaelMistak> Already did. Your outage map that doesn‚Äôt show any outages (even thoug support says there is one) was particularly unhelpful. Difficult to explain to my boss that I can‚Äôt connect when your outage map says everything is hunky dory.
1217442746706944001 2020-01-15 08:45:44 EDT <dgreichert> No it isn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm reporting an outage. You can‚Äôt see my equipment because there‚Äôs an outage. If you can see it to perform a restart, don‚Äôt you think it‚Äôs because there‚Äôs an outage?
1217442406490046467 2020-01-15 08:44:23 EDT <Xfinity> Hi Daniel. The best way to keep updated on outages is by using the My Account app.
1217441114933932032 2020-01-15 08:39:15 EDT <BoneAlone2> @Xfinity we‚Äôve had an outage in our area for over 10 hours. This happens once a week but never for this long. Are y‚Äôall gonna credit us? We gotta pay that bill still right? This is crazy how trash your service is and people don‚Äôt have an option to switch.
1217440513936252929 2020-01-15 08:36:52 EDT <dgreichert> Of course you can‚Äôt run a modem health check @Xfinity! THERE‚ÄôS AN OUTAGE. Why do you think I‚Äôm calling?! This is the dumbest automated support ‚Äúfeature‚Äù I‚Äôve ever encountered.

1216810063584808961 2020-01-13 14:51:41 EDT <daveungersound> Yes. Apparently ‚Äúthere is a technician in my area‚Äù doing something to cause an outage. Two days in a row. Seriously impacting my ability to run my business.
1216808241994387461 2020-01-13 14:44:26 EDT <iFiddleDeeDee> An area outage that‚Äôs so far lasted 12 hours. I think I should be allowed out of my contract without penalties since you cannot provide the services that you promised. This is the 4th long term outage and I‚Äôve been a customer for less than a yr.
1216808222297903105 2020-01-13 14:44:22 EDT <Xfinity> Sorry for the inconvenience! Have these been are outages?

1216534916432912386 2020-01-12 20:38:20 EDT <DeedoPeedo> Update: @Xfinity, the internet outage is still going strong, 4 hours in. During the playoffs.
1216503967217139713 2020-01-12 18:35:21 EDT <robertmcgilvrey> Comcast cable and internet in Seattle outage just in time for the Seahawks Divisional playoff game. @comcast @Xfinity
1216492426962993153 2020-01-12 17:49:30 EDT <OfficeMonkey> Hey, @NFLonFOX! Did your licensing agreement with @Xfinity to allow streaming allow for exceptions to the in-home-wifi-only policy when Xfinity has service outages?
1216488335943905285 2020-01-12 17:33:15 EDT <galawssi> @comcastsupport @xfinity seriously a ‚Äúoutage‚Äù 1 of the greatest games/comebacks and now you have a ‚Äúoutage‚Äù.  Time to switch!!
1216488318692515840 2020-01-12 17:33:11 EDT <OfficeMonkey> @Xfinity FOUR outages in three days and your damn automated system won't let me TALK TO A HUMAN BEING to get a service credit?? I'm your CUSTOMER.
1216477241200332801 2020-01-12 16:49:10 EDT <indianapolis420> .@Xfinity Hell of a fucking time for a  system-wide outage in my area don't you think? .@Uverse is sure looking really good right now.
1216476646724841473 2020-01-12 16:46:48 EDT <emilymoser0127> @Xfinity outages again in Tinley Park.  6th day of no internet service!  When will you have a solution and when am I getting a credit for a service I don‚Äôt receive!  #xfinity sucks!
1216469249192972288 2020-01-12 16:17:24 EDT <ammiano> @Xfinity @comcast Thanks for getting the work done quickly on Friday 1/10 in my south Seattle neighborhood. It was a delightful surprise. And the communications about the outage were excellent. #CustomerService
1216458156445962240 2020-01-12 15:33:19 EDT <neonladder> @Xfinity thanks for another 3 to 5 day outage on our telephone, cable TV and internet. No chance of service today. You will reimburse us $6 to $8 - thanks! I wish we were not forced to use you by our HOA.
1216443223037616137 2020-01-12 14:33:59 EDT <Z_Kaffenberger> @comcast @Xfinity literally the worst and most unreliable company in the country. Cable outage YESTERDAY and they can‚Äôt come fix our internet or cable until THURSDAY. I will spend the rest of 2020 getting everyone possible to leave @Comcast unless something is done TODAY.
1216350575660498945 2020-01-12 08:25:50 EDT <PhilSwindall> @Xfinity first, you said the outage would be fixed at 5:55 pm yesterday. Then 5:45 am today. Now 5:35 pm today?
1216279824957870080 2020-01-12 03:44:42 EDT <cynthiamckinney> Extinct @Xfinity: Got away with operating a slush fund from @CityofAtlanta subscriptions yet telephone outages are a regular feature; what about a health emergency when our Comcast phone is out? Collapsing @Comcast shouldn't be allowed to operate in this life-endangering manner.
1216230075147980800 2020-01-12 00:27:01 EDT <connorterrelldt> Xfinity owes me the hours and visuals I lost due to their outage in my area
1216227622369341440 2020-01-12 00:17:16 EDT <05RS1tC> @Xfinity where is my service?! Been out all day and the outage map is useless when it won't show me the area that is out. And the time for it fixed has constantly been pushed back since 130pm est!
1216208857946607617 2020-01-11 23:02:42 EDT <Bim_Binzer> @comcastcares ty for ruining my life with ur xfinity outages. I‚Äôm going to punch a random pedestrian now because of you.
1216175929921363969 2020-01-11 20:51:51 EDT <weirdfood> @Xfinity How about fixing the cable outage so I can watch some football?
1216167250257944576 2020-01-11 20:17:22 EDT <kg_woltz> @comcastcares another prime time outage WTF? #Xfinity #badservice
1216160785019424769 2020-01-11 19:51:40 EDT <AntWayneWorld> This Xfinity outage is blowing me right now!
1216144183704027136 2020-01-11 18:45:42 EDT <AtlantaGrinch> Atlanta power outage and playoff football not a great combo. @wsbtv Thanks @Xfinity streaming app #clutch
1216114073525460995 2020-01-11 16:46:04 EDT <jeffsgo17> @Xfinity what the ever loving he‚Äôll is going on!?!?  I pay you guys a crap ton on $$$$ and now you‚Äôve been on an outage for hours and looks to be for at least 6 more hours!!!  I can‚Äôt watch the Vikings game!!ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨
1216049190461169664 2020-01-11 12:28:14 EDT <MzMoe204> Thank you @Xfinity for resolving the power outage before the time frame told to us after the storm we had last night in Houston.
1215799590248763392 2020-01-10 19:56:25 EDT <itspi314> Hey @Xfinity any update on the outage please??  I would like to stream games live on @mixer and watch TV...  Instead I'm sitting here alone.. twittling my thumbs waiting for service to come back that was supposed to be restored 45 minutes ago!!! pic.twitter.com/sQIDCSS5Uc
1215792117345329153 2020-01-10 19:26:43 EDT <Hank_Von_Douche> @xfinity y'all niggas wildin with this outage shit again!  Trying to play 2k you gay monkeys!
1215777736624492545 2020-01-10 18:29:35 EDT <NewYorkcitisevl> @Xfinity Get your shit together man!!    Another outage!?
1215759973730455553 2020-01-10 17:19:00 EDT <KingBean904> @Comcast This makes no sense. My home service the internet and the cable is down. But if I drive 1 mile and the xfinity WiFi hotspot is working and working well. ETA time for the outage to be fixed in our area is 7pm. Every month there is a damn problem with you guys service.
1215734783919165440 2020-01-10 15:38:54 EDT <BiancaXaviera_> Every time Xfinity have an unplanned outage; they need to knock $10 off my high ass bill.
1215725372945457152 2020-01-10 15:01:30 EDT <jfm2_> Really?? I‚Äôm in the middle of working and @Xfinity has an internet outage! ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è #ImDoneForTheDay
1215722244925616128 2020-01-10 14:49:04 EDT <mrmatthew> Why of course Xfinity is having an area-wide outage today while I‚Äôm working from home and have two huge reports, two important meetings, and a bunch of important insights-asks popping up. Yep, that‚Äôs about right.  pic.twitter.com/qezcOYHFCo
1215703128525418498 2020-01-10 13:33:07 EDT <ThisIs__Me_> Got an outage. Xfinity always disappoints.
1215696874507649024 2020-01-10 13:08:16 EDT <ogre1500> Paid the @Xfinity bill at night. Hey home from work this morning, flip the TV on. And guess who's having an outage, @comcastcares...
1215661411851833345 2020-01-10 10:47:21 EDT <chrodriquez> Outage resolution was 9pm, then 12:30am, now no time given. @Xfinity @comcastcares @comcast do you think the #XfinityOutage in Clovis will be resolved today?
1215650102183940096 2020-01-10 10:02:24 EDT <_stillamystery> But nooooo Xfinity has yet ANOTHER outage!   You bitches better count your days! üòí
1215598101001621504 2020-01-10 06:35:46 EDT <nikkidelphia> Um...@Xfinity it is now 6:32am and TV and Internet outage still going on after you stated 12:45am, then 3:33am and now ‚Äúresolved ASAP‚Äù? I work from home. I guess I can‚Äôt work today. Great job, assholes. Customers won‚Äôt even get credit for the inconvenience. Time for new cable/TV.
1215556054903214080 2020-01-10 03:48:42 EDT <chubbiebunz> Seriously Xfinity??! There‚Äôs another outage right when I was streaming my game üò≠ can y‚Äôall send us emails when there will be a maintenance PLEASE??!  pic.twitter.com/hlVCvVzJGt
1215503658835566594 2020-01-10 00:20:29 EDT <chrodriquez> Thanks for the incorrect #XfinityOutage information. @Xfinity @comcast @comcastcares outage was to be resolved an hour ago, just updated 10 mins ago now it will be 3 more hours.?
1215490385193193472 2020-01-09 23:27:45 EDT <aliciabella> #xfinity is horrible they never communicate to their overseas customer service when there is an outage so it wastes everyone's time . Wish we had other choices
1215458842668040197 2020-01-09 21:22:24 EDT <nikkidelphia> Damn @Xfinity outage won‚Äôt be resolved until 12:45am? Wtfffffff...
1215402353739825154 2020-01-09 17:37:56 EDT <Princess2kool> @Xfinity you raggedy bitch. HOW and WHY does MYYY service keep getting interrupted when the outages ARE NOT EVEN IN MY AREA? Or are your outage maps A LIE? EXPLAIN!
1215385923010973696 2020-01-09 16:32:39 EDT <Ashweryy> I don‚Äôt know? But there has been an outage since 6ish pacific time last night   That your app says ‚Äúwe‚Äôre working diligently to fix‚Äù
1215374215672582144 2020-01-09 15:46:08 EDT <rocknrollgeek> Curious what the riots would be like  if power or water companies had outages and issues as often as US cable companies (@Ask_Spectrum / Charter, @comcast / @Xfinity, Cox/ @CoxHelp ) do. It‚Äôs 2020. The internet is a needed utility not much different than the others. üòµüòî
1215371092912746498 2020-01-09 15:33:43 EDT <dedelashlabbb> Xfinity trippin w the outage üòí
1215355500520493057 2020-01-09 14:31:46 EDT <KirstinStone> @Xfinity stopping calling an outage ‚Äújust an hour more‚Äù when there‚Äôs no way to know. Some of us work from home and wind up with wasted days when u do. Just tell us if we need to go elsewhere for the day (and then credit us for the lost service).
1215348885163597825 2020-01-09 14:05:28 EDT <KingCGame> @Xfinity outage started at 9:42AM. Here we are waiting for maintenance to be done a 1PM, apparently not finished. At least give us a warning.
1215345176152928256 2020-01-09 13:50:44 EDT <MoonRocks303> On it. Weird part is that everything was cool, I was inactive for over an hour because of an Xfinity outage and when I logged back in I was suspended.
1215329064937897985 2020-01-09 12:46:43 EDT <Orangebalr0g> Of course Xfinity has another "outage"...
1215324687900823556 2020-01-09 12:29:19 EDT <tyon305> @Xfinity service outage in Miami Dadeü§î
1215295671558901760 2020-01-09 10:34:01 EDT <ahomsher> Another minor outage with @xfinity in vero beach.  While I'm on the phone with a medical provider. We just downgraded our service to 60mbps , obvious customer harrassment.
1215283180388917249 2020-01-09 09:44:23 EDT <kristenhewitt> Hey @Xfinity @comcastcares - how can I go online to report an outage of internet when I don‚Äôt have internet?  Please DM me - I need someone to call me ASAP.
1215231975520448513 2020-01-09 06:20:55 EDT <BigtimeAallyhia> The fact that xfinity still has an outage really scares me. Like I get its a new decade and all but shit like....get your shit together.
1215205185074561027 2020-01-09 04:34:28 EDT <IVdrifter5> Xfinity is so fucking trash. These outages are annoying as all hell, and they happen way too often.
1215161928638705665 2020-01-09 01:42:35 EDT <AndrewReise> The best part of @Xfinity internet?  The constant outages really make me spend quality time with my family.  pic.twitter.com/9phxKuWzFO
1215151569320022016 2020-01-09 01:01:25 EDT <deifrankone> I just don't understand it. I'm over here on LTE cuz @Xfinity can't provide internet service whenever I'm home. I should've checked for outages while I was away and just complained to get refunds even when I wasn't here.
1215124836227436545 2020-01-08 23:15:11 EDT <swimsuz> @Xfinity my app both account and Xfinity stream won‚Äôt work - is there an outage or system is down happening?
1215026607678734338 2020-01-08 16:44:52 EDT <S3_ADot> Come on with this nut ass outage @Xfinity
1215021908028252160 2020-01-08 16:26:11 EDT <zipzephir_deb> @comcastcares any updates on Xfinity tv & internet outage? Apparently been out all day
1215021066545848320 2020-01-08 16:22:50 EDT <therealmarilyn2> @Xfinity @comcast Hey! Look, false advertisement! #Day5 this company lies and won‚Äôt help us! Customer Service is important!!! No internet and it‚Äôs not due to an outage. It‚Äôs due to lowsy service set up for a new customer!!!!!  pic.twitter.com/LprBJ3K57h
1215018293226029057 2020-01-08 16:11:49 EDT <BigtimeAallyhia> The xfinity outage IS STILL going on from where I live.
1215009242899501057 2020-01-08 15:35:51 EDT <musicncolors> @Xfinity @comcastcares So, my wifi has been down since last night and it‚Äôs still down! These outages have been happening frequently in my area (zip code 77072). I hope y‚Äôall fix the issue soon! I would hate have to change services. Also, I hope we get a discount on our next bill!
1215007362903367680 2020-01-08 15:28:23 EDT <emilymoser0127> @Xfinity another outage in our area.  Just wondering if this will ever get fixed?! #xfinitysucks

1214956811356385281 2020-01-08 12:07:31 EDT <jgulden> Literally within five minutes, my internet goes out  I open the Xfinity app using cellular internet on my phone to check if there's an outage, initially not connecting the two things  Oh look! I'm no longer signed up for internet service, just TV (I don't even have a cable box)
1214917406998564865 2020-01-08 09:30:56 EDT <Xfinity> Hey there, sorry for the delay! You can always check on service outages & updates on the My Account app.
1214852112154288129 2020-01-08 05:11:29 EDT <BigtimeAallyhia> Can Xfinity just end their outage already? Its been HOURS...

1214731008282701825 2020-01-07 21:10:15 EDT <bo_riser> @ComcastCares this is what happens when you cancel service after months of outages. They promised no fees. #xfinity #comcast pic.twitter.com/D2K31urmsJ

1214612001760018432 2020-01-07 13:17:22 EDT <Mnt_Thunder92> @comcast @Xfinity is the biggest rip off I have ever seen. Pay for internet, and there is a random outage on a sunny day? Pay for cable to watch local live sports including a regional $10 sports fee, and they don‚Äôt broadcast the nuggets or Avs

1214562454149066752 2020-01-07 10:00:29 EDT <Xfinity> Hi when this haooens, does your internet disconnect  or are you referring to area-wide outages?
1214561790194880514 2020-01-07 09:57:50 EDT <ahomsher> @Xfinity is so lousy. Lots of small outages and the dishonesty with plan arrangements is staggering. In December we signed up for a total cost $79 per month, tv package & internet, taxes. Bill comes $97. Zero help in store and on phone. #tuesdayvibes
1214542224400224257 2020-01-07 08:40:06 EDT <Dumajad> @Xfinity do you have knowledge of a outage in service for the Denver area? WiFi.

1213948604508966913 2020-01-05 17:21:16 EDT <emilymoser0127> @Xfinity outages just about everyday in Tinley Park!  Unreal.  Can‚Äôt watch footfall!  Would like a credit!!  üò°üò°üò° #Xfinitysucks
1213877362854637568 2020-01-05 12:38:10 EDT <Puckbrat> @comcastcares @Xfinity how is it that Comcast has so many outages? And often after I pay my very expensive bill? Once again no internet or TV service. And I switched why?!? Still waiting for that Visa card the promotion promised too...another load of crap
1213871224520167429 2020-01-05 12:13:47 EDT <gennatay> Is @googlefiber available on Chicago‚Äôs Southside yet? I‚Äôm am SO tired of @Xfinity going out every weekend.  @comcastcares, I‚Äôm expecting another credit for this outage
1213852135693139969 2020-01-05 10:57:56 EDT <austinatlanta> Reached out to @Xfinity about the outage in Atlanta. There is no ETA. Is this part of a #ComcastCyberAttack?
1213842342244954112 2020-01-05 10:19:01 EDT <austinatlanta> I might be reaching, but the outage I am experiencing began around the same time that Iran hacked US Government websites.
1213751980696322048 2020-01-05 04:19:57 EDT <510MenaceLDS> @Xfinity why is my internet not working in the bay area??? Is there a service outage??
1213693227414347777 2020-01-05 00:26:29 EDT <pcnerd37> I know the feeling with Centurysnail.  We have their 7mbps service out at work.  The speed with Comcast is great but the outages really suck.
1213690442945925120 2020-01-05 00:15:25 EDT <moonglowSiberia> Don‚Äôt get me wrong we had centurysnail before and 4 people sharing 12mbps was just poop and since we switched to like 200 from Comcast it‚Äôs been a dream but a lot of outages lately when I‚Äôm tryna play my games ‚òπÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1213689166158061569 2020-01-05 00:10:21 EDT <MsWitts> @Xfinity having an on demand outage tonight is a major party foul.
1213663384937402368 2020-01-04 22:27:54 EDT <Jorgeyprep9> @Xfinity why do I not get a credit for having so many outages in one month its ridiculous! I talk to your "customer service" people and one of them just laughed about the issue I'm a college student and i need this internet to at least not go down every other day!!!!!
1213642282425036800 2020-01-04 21:04:03 EDT <_iclixz_> @Xfinity @comcastcares This is ridiculous theres another service outage in my area! There seems to be one at least once a week, this is horrible and it always happens at the worst times. This type of service is trash. You would think for how much money we pay this wouldn't happen
1213592464763817984 2020-01-04 17:46:05 EDT <KSaindore> Excuse me @Xfinity Why in the Atlanta area Y‚Äôall  I want to play with my cable?  I pay $200 every month that means I want to watch these NFL playoffs and it says the Cable outage in my area will not be coming back on until 7:30 tonight ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1213583021321814021 2020-01-04 17:08:34 EDT <ndabeesing85> Who‚Äôs hates @Xfinity as much as me? Once again another outage for internet and cable during the football playoffs. I honestly can‚Äôt wait till my contract is up with this horrible company.  pic.twitter.com/rp94q3vzlM
1213577763053080583 2020-01-04 16:47:40 EDT <Sammy_Sama> Ey @Xfinity how about when there is an outage or someone working on lines in an area, you send out an automated message so people aren't in the middle of streaming when shit hits the fan. Thanks.
1213557638157479936 2020-01-04 15:27:42 EDT <ThatBitch_MAC> This xfinity outage finna blow me.
1213557224456540167 2020-01-04 15:26:03 EDT <JCraig519> Seriously @xfinity!!??  Outage right before the playoff game and when I called you offered 1 day ‚Äúcredit‚Äù to my account!  What about the $200 plus in food spent and plans all centered around having tv being ruined?  Wow glad you care so much, will be cancelling.
1213547292902461441 2020-01-04 14:46:35 EDT <jeffbalke> Poor timing for an Xfinity outage that won‚Äôt be repaired until 5:30. #Texans
1213546135345909760 2020-01-04 14:41:59 EDT <MarkRam53328809> Of course a @Xfinity outage in Houston, right before the @HoustonTexans playoff game! üò°üò°
1213488032109809664 2020-01-04 10:51:07 EDT <BmoreShawty> It's always an WIFI or cable outage with Xfinity/Comcast üòí
1213485687888068614 2020-01-04 10:41:48 EDT <modemjunkie> . @Xfinity outage In River Forest.  I don't know the full area of coverage  pic.twitter.com/jLZ5H413kW
1213479061625946114 2020-01-04 10:15:28 EDT <theinfamouscpa> @Xfinity outages always come at the most inconvenient times
1213308963846066176 2020-01-03 22:59:33 EDT <IrishMartzall> @ATT once again no internet or cable service. Nonstop outages in our community, you fix one home, cut service at another, the 5th time for us. Zero Customer service. @Xfinity can you do better? We will switch tomorrow! @Hmartzall
1213255457143480320 2020-01-03 19:26:56 EDT <comcast> You can check the Xfinity My Account app for updates on outages in the area. -Gabbie
1213254326786940928 2020-01-03 19:22:27 EDT <comcast> Hmm, is there an outage in the area? Using the Xfinity My Account app as a resource to identify outages, maintenance and to troubleshoot your connection is helpful! I would also make sure all of your connections are finger-tight. -Gabbie
1213197070322085888 2020-01-03 15:34:56 EDT <wickedbruinsfan> It said there was an outage earlier in Brighton area. My zip code is 02138. Anything around here? Internet is still down.
1213174456031408128 2020-01-03 14:05:04 EDT <simonlutrin> Hey @Comcast @Xfinity you‚Äôre terrible. Why do I pay so much for these constant outages?
1213160840674906112 2020-01-03 13:10:58 EDT <sydneycalmes> @Xfinity i hate y‚Äôall. fix this outage bruh
1212931110793076741 2020-01-02 21:58:06 EDT <HoppyConserv> Great news @ATTHelp you have another outage in Fort Worth. Another cryptic 24 hours where I can't do my job save spawning a hotspot from my phone - which can't serve our whole house and kids doing school work - never had this problem with @xfinity #attfail #imisscompetition
1212895411578572800 2020-01-02 19:36:15 EDT <Xfinity> Have you checked the Xfinity My Account app to see if there is an outage in the area? If there isn't, try doing a System Refresh.
1212841975944224772 2020-01-02 16:03:55 EDT <FadedCurry> How Comcast got an outage in my area but the public xfinity WiFi working ü§®
1212830637268312067 2020-01-02 15:18:51 EDT <Steam_Sports> What's the deal with these outages today @Xfinity @comcast @comcastcares?
1212791324107255809 2020-01-02 12:42:38 EDT <trjenkins> My services aren‚Äôt disconnected! I paid my bill, ON TIME and the next one is not due until the 11th. It clearly says an outage in the area! I have to be at work for NOON and I work from HOME! 3:12pm is unacceptable! This entire ordeal is unacceptable!  pic.twitter.com/nGTi8qGGSX
1212790222972477440 2020-01-02 12:38:16 EDT <Xfinity> Hi, when you experience outages are your services listed as disconnected in the MyAccount app?
1212788637915631616 2020-01-02 12:31:58 EDT <trjenkins> @Xfinity Hey! I‚Äôm a new customer, & I absolutely HATE your service! I work from home & I am unable to work because there is ANOTHER outage! Get it together! I was with @ATT for years & this never affected my job! I was forced to come to U because we moved! Do better! DO BETTER!
1212770864430768128 2020-01-02 11:21:20 EDT <cmichaels620> Not in our neighborhood, and a Comcast exec lives across the street!   We‚Äôve had only 1  outage, for a whopping 10 seconds, since moving to PA a year ago.  Our neighbor, who has Xfinity, has come over several times to connect to our FIOS.
1212738808111865856 2020-01-02 09:13:58 EDT <I_mak_u_nsecure> Switching to @Xfinity for WiFi was biggest mistake. The first tech didn‚Äôt install it correctly, 2nd tech somehow mess up my air and heating and now I have to use space heaters for me and son to stay warm, the bill was way more and I‚Äôve more outage in area then in. #theworst
1212677845845204992 2020-01-02 05:11:43 EDT <nexusplays_> Swear to God Xfinity is such dogshit. Literally keep having outages in my area.. seriously thinking about switching to AT&T Fiber soon üòíüôÑ
1212654105534971905 2020-01-02 03:37:23 EDT <sabbysaabz> @Xfinity is there a outage somewhere in WA?? the wifi on my phone is terrible! its literally been out for 3 days. fix it or I'm going to another internet provider.
1212580423970111488 2020-01-01 22:44:36 EDT <KingMckellop14> Dear @Xfinity, Since y‚Äôall want to experience power outages during my football games when this months bill comes I believe my bank account will experience a power outage when you try to get your money. Thank you
1212567458260963329 2020-01-01 21:53:05 EDT <dstipton> @Xfinity why do you keep saying outage will be fixed by a certain time, and when that time comes you add another 3 hours? Are you really even trying to fix it? Missed a whole day of football! ‚ÄúGreat‚Äù service.
1212497117442383872 2020-01-01 17:13:34 EDT <internashnald> @Xfinity is there an outage is 21224/21222
1212484485826134017 2020-01-01 16:23:22 EDT <Neatfreax> Ah yes, what better way to kick off the new decade than with an internet outage from Xfinity.
1212469118089256961 2020-01-01 15:22:18 EDT <puj_sixfourteen> Even if I still gave a shit about 19-20 CFB and wanted to watch the Bowls* I could not because @Xfinity has conveniently been experiencing an outage in my area since right before the fireworks #14hrsandcounting
1212459693630730241 2020-01-01 14:44:52 EDT <Firewalkwithm17> I'm in Baltimore. From what I gathered, I saw people down in DC reporting outages too. It was very widespread if it ran from at least DC, to here!
1212443601155842048 2020-01-01 13:40:55 EDT <H_TownRacer> Really xfinity? Going to start 2020 wirh a fucking outage? Like there ain‚Äôt all these Bowl Games on? This is BULLSHIT.
1212418749741043714 2020-01-01 12:02:10 EDT <jvodomjr> Once again @Xfinity fails. Just lost internet and TV. Going to call @comcastcares but will be told it‚Äôs only an issue at my house and they‚Äôll need to schedule a tech sometime Saturday because none are available for days. Then, they‚Äôll acknowledge the outage is broader.  @comcast
1212393446167785473 2020-01-01 10:21:37 EDT <BamaBoyee89> What‚Äôs up with that? I had several hours-long outages last week too.
1212375368075796480 2020-01-01 09:09:47 EDT <Lariidahh> Yo xFinity can you fix your shit? You‚Äôve had ‚Äúoutages in my area‚Äù since 11:45 last night, I have shit to do. üôÑ
1212360397732364289 2020-01-01 08:10:18 EDT <d_christophor> @Xfinity service has been trash for the past 2 weeks with these ‚Äúoutages‚Äù I better get a discount on my internet bill ü§Æü§Æü§Æ

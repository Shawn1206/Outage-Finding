Xfinity's 1-800 number won't let me connect to an agent.

I've had 5 or more outages since June. these outages last all day. like a lot of people, due to Covid, i am working from home. the outages are directly impacting my ability to do my job. my leadership is understanding, but this is ridiculous. 2 outages a month. no pro-active communication about it. 

i would like you all to help pay me for the time I'm missing from work.


 everything was stable and reliable until this summer. i need you all to remedy this - not by having an outage at 11am and being told, by an automated voice, that the outage will last until 430pm. those are working/office hours.

can someone contact me?"
2020-08-20 15:25:14,Comcast_Xfinity,Outages back to back,"I recently started working from home and outages have been happening on a monthly basis.

Now in August, I'm on my third outage. Not to mention, my internet has been going out every couple of hours in the morning as of the last couple of days.

When I got in touch with a rep, they advised the outages are due to the heavy traffic. Really? And when I advised of my internet drops, they blamed my third party modem . I told them it happened same days of outages, and then the rep blamed the heavy traffic again . 

I live in sfl, Broward county if it makes any difference. But what is going on? How many techs / days does it take to fix an outage .  Or restore it in manner that it won't happen again . 

There was one time where my internet was gone half the day... 12 hour outage.

I need Google fiber in my area :(  

Anyone else experience frequent outages recently ?"

I started recording my modem signal levels every 1 minute and it appears my connection drops occur when there is a signficant temporary spike in my upstream power level, and occasionally the modem status page will be unreachable but the modem lights appear normal. During each outage there is an increase in uncorrectable codewords and T3/T4 timeouts in the modem logs.

My house wiring setup has the cable drop connecting to a 2-way splitter with one leg going to the modem and the second leg going to a 3-way splitter for 3 tv's.

2020-08-18 18:49:25,Comcast_Xfinity,Bunch of T3 Timeouts and Dynamic Range Window Violation,"In the last month or so we have been getting outage spikes that last anywhere from 10 seconds to a minute about 15+ times a day. I first upgraded my modem as I had the current one for about 5 years and figured it was time. No success.  


 I've called customer service a few times and finally had a tech come today. i told him about my errors and he told me the only thing he could do was test my signal strength. He checked it and said i was getting about 9dBs from the line and that was possibly too strong a signal so he told me adding an attenuator directly to my modem would be his only bet. He also mentioned he couldn't really check the exterior line because i live in a townhouse and all of our lines go underground, and he didn't have a key to the junction locker. 

Network worked for maybe an hour until i received the attached errors and had the network go down about 5 or 6 times for a few seconds at a time. 

Note: the T3 Timeouts were happening before the tech came and also with an older modem. Once the tech added the Attenuator i am now receiving the Dynamic Range Window Violation. I am willing to call Customer Support again but I am looking into any direct way I could possibly have our exterior line checked as I am pretty confident that is my issue at this point.

I received a notification things were back up, but they're not back up for me; I still have no connectivity.  Modem is a Netgear CM600; when I log into it, it tells me my cable connection is good on the dashboard, but logging in my Netgear router tells me no internet.  I have bypassed the router entirely and connected both a PC and an Xbox directly to the modem via two separate ethernet cables, and had internet on either.  I've cycled the power and reset the modem a number of times, and I've talked to Comcast support both via chat and phone, and it appears I have a good connection I think they said to the outside.

I'm not a network guy, but have enough familiarity with this to where I think I've done everything, and I actually sucked it up and went to Nextdoor for once, and several people are reporting their modems have essentially stopped working due to some network upgrade.  This does appear to be at my modem level, as bypassing the router doesn't change a thing; does this seem viable?  I've had the modem for several years with no issue, and, really, this is the first outage of any length of time I've ever had, and my internet has been rock-solid and faster than I think I even signed up for, and, well, if I""m giving Comcast props today, tech support has been amazingly polite and helpful.

But, anyways, is my modem toast?  As an IT person working from home losing internet is . . . aggressively unfortunate, and just curious if I should just suck it up and buy myself a new modem, and, if so, what a solid option would be."

2020-08-14 23:46:58,Comcast_Xfinity,Getting RFC 1918 address from modem,"I have a SB8200 and I have the following issue: when connected to my router/firewall (pfSense) I cant get a DHCP lease. If I connect a laptop directly to the modem, I get an IP in 192.168.100.0/24 and can access the Internet. I suspect pfSense will not take this on the WAN because it’s reserved private. This behavior persists modem reboots and router reboots. I see no way to change any settings in the Arris to enable bridge mode. This used to work perfectly, but I’ve been offline for a few months due to construction. Has Comcast changed their network to give RFC 1918 addresses and do some CGNAT or something? (I’m told there is an outage in my area so they will not help me until that is cleared, but I have Internet access if I connect directly so I don’t think I’m impacted by the outage.)"

I can't figure this one out.  So like everyone else in the world I'm WFH.  This week at one point, my wife and a child were also Work/School from home.

Consistently for about a month now I have been having an outage at noon, and then random times throughout the day.  The first thing I did was upgrade my router to the TP-Link Archer AX10.  Left that for about a month and didn't fix it, so this week I upgraded my Arris SB6141 to the SB6183 (I know it's not DOCSIS 3.1, but it's the only one I could find in stock around here.

2020-08-12 06:04:13,Comcast_Xfinity,Why The Misinformation / Lies Around Service Outages?,"I'm not trying to be cruel or offensive; I'm just trying to understand better. I can understand why outages might happen, but I don't understand why each time I contact Comcast/Xfinity I get, seemingly, lied to.

Here is my specific example, but this happens all the time...

Monday afternoon we have a storm. Internet is fine. Three hours later, internet goes down. At first, the app/website says no outage. Sometimes it will never report an outage, when I know both my house and my neighbors both have an outage at the same time. Sometimes it just takes 15 minutes.

So I end up with a chat rep telling me the service is fine, telling me to tighten screws, offering to schedule a service tech... But it is all lies.

Usually the outage is acknowledged. On Monday, the ETA for a fix was just after midnight. So, I wait until midnight.... Still not fixed.

Next morning at 6am, still no fix. Now there is no ETA on the website. I contact a chat rep who is happy to assure me it will be fixed by 10:02am.

Why can the chat reps see more outage information than I can? Or do they literally just make up numbers?

At 10:02am, my service remains out. Website has no ETA. By noon, no status update, the chat rep tells me it will be resolved 'soon'.... And that with some prodding, that soon should mean 'within an hour'. That hour comes and goes, still no internet.

Next I'm told by 6pm. That doesn't happen either.

I go to bed at 11pm with no internet access.

Today I wake up at 5am and the website now says intent access should be restored by Friday at 11pm.

Four days without internet sucks... But why do they constantly tell me it will be fixed soon? 

The local electric company never has such problems. They have an outage from time to time, but they always seem able to honor their word."

Woke up this morning and checked it got moved to 8/11 6:30pm! I work from home and I need Internet otherwise I don’t get paid, so I took an unpaid day today. Then right now it says it will be fixed 8/14 at 3:30pm! I can’t take another THREE days unpaid. And that’s if they even fix it by then. What if it gets moved to the next day or next week!. My cousin’s friend who lives a mile away from here has service. Why is it taking so long?! I wish they would tell me the reason, ugh."
2020-08-11 12:56:10,Comcast_Xfinity,Service disconnected question.,"Hello, I have a question if anyone can answer based off the circumstances. This morning, when I awoke, my internet was down, and looking into the issue, I was notified of an outage in my area they were working on. When I checked via my phone on data, I noticed that the website said my services were disconnected, with a $0 amount due. Is this normal during an outage.
Next is that it is saying that I can't access my account settings at all, due to that my xfinity services are disconnected. Once again, is this normal?
Finally, I was originally added on as another user to the account by my initial roommate, and maitaining it on my own after they moved out, with them leaving their account credentials behind just in case, while they have no longer accessed their account. Attempting to assess the issue, I made my account the main account, and was also attempting to look at alternate plans since my current roommate wants to see what other deals they have on internet, and it was saying on both my account which is now assigned as the main, and my former roommate's account, that only the main user can view that tab. What can I do, or how do I just restart a new plan at this point? Is this all stemming from the outage?"
2020-08-10 09:55:37,Comcast_Xfinity,Intermittent internet outages for last two months,"Hello,

For the past two or three months, I have been experiencing intermittent internet outages that are resolved by a modem (SB6190) reset.  This happens once or twice a day and is problematic especially now that I'm working from home primarily.

I've called support multiple times just to be told to reset my router and that they can't send anyone out because of COVID-19 unless you're having a total outage.  I understand the desire to keep employees safe but when your internet access is so problematic it may as well be an outage.

I have been a Comcast customer in this house since 2013 and this is the first time I've had an issue, so I guess that's a positive.

Anyhow, here are my current modem logs if anyone can help get this addressed, I would be appreciative."

I called Xfinity, went through all the troubleshooting, and even got to where I gave them the MAC address of the modem and they ran a trace route , confirming that the issue was broken Comcast equipment upstream into our neighborhood, and gave me a ticket number.  An hour later, it still says no issues are reported and I call back and get the initial answer that nothing is wrong and it's probably just me.  They run a trace route again and confirm (again) that the issue is with their own equipment.  That was a half hour ago.  They're still telling neighbors there is no issue and they will send a tech out IN 2 DAYS.

She just experienced yet another outage, and is freaking out she's going to get let go today after she lost a 2 hour long call. We have maxed out our phone tethering plans, and have run through the 10gb we have between us with AT&amp;T to keep working. I get its kind to offer $20 credit but we just want what we are paying for, the loss of employment (&gt;50k) won't be offset by credits  


I have had 3 separate visits from comcast, the last from the two 'most senior technicians' - levels have been perfect and no issues inside the house. The first visit the tech reported frequent suckout at the box off our property, the second tech said everything was perfect then we experienced an outage while he was here and he said the levels were so low any connection was impossible and raised another network ticket. The third techs said the network team fixed everything and everything was perfect.   


Our troubleshooting

We follow the troubleshooting steps every time provided by chat (restarting, tightening connections, etc)

We replaced our modem (even though all of these impact cable and internet),   
We replaced the splitter (three times now, there is only one),   
The line is a direct feed, we replaced the line, we re-terminated every connection  
Technicians installed a filter, removed the filter, re-installed the filter in a new location  


When our connection works all levels are essentially perfect. Every time I contact support I get a message later comcast has resolved my issue and I don't need an appointment, and it just keeps going down. Next steps please?"

2020-08-01 12:27:49,Comcast_Xfinity,Intermittent Issues Since March,"Hello All,

&amp;#x200B;

Since March I've been having multiple 5-20 minute internet outages every single day. I have two friends who live in the same complex but in different buildings. One is having no issues and the other loses internet at exactly the same time I do and it comes back up at exactly the same time. We've been texting each other daily when it happens to see if it's the same issue or if we're having isolated issues, but every outage occurs at the exact same time. Contacting Comcast has been the most frustrating event I've ever experienced. Getting a technician to come out took all the way up until early July and they claimed the issue was a maintenance issue. Since then, my friend who also experiences the same problem has had a technician come out, but no follow up and nothing has been done to fix the problem. Getting through to tech support that the issue cannot be a modem problem, since it is happening to two separate people in non-adjacent buildings, is almost impossible. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what else to do to fix the issue and we're about to drop Xfinity due to this. The two of us have spent hours upon hours at this point on the phone and on the xfinity chat trying to get this resolved. We both pay over $100 a month just for internet and we lose service multiple times every day. We both work from home during the pandemic and it's interfering with our work. Is there any advice we could take in order to go from here or how we can get through to Comcast that the issue needs to be resolved?"
2020-07-31 17:58:28,Comcast_Xfinity,"3 tech visits later, looking for some help","Hello friends!

I am experiencing intermittent daily outages that last for several hours at a time. The worst of the outages seem to be between 3pm and 6pm when my internet seems to be up 50% of the time or less, but I'll have outages outside of these times as well (last night I had an outage at midnight, for example).  I have had a number of conversations with Xfinity over the phone, and they have sent out 2 Xfinity techs to diagnose the issue from inside my house and one Comcast tech to run a new RG-11 cable from my house to ""the node"" (maybe that's the CMTS, not sure).  This specific issue has existed in this severity for about 3 weeks now.  Before then, I had basically perfect uptime with blisteringly fast speeds.

Important caveat! There are two active Xfinity modems in my house. The RG-11 from the node that runs to the side of my house is split into two \~100ft cables: one for me, and one for my roommates. My roommates are experiencing little to no downtime on their modem (apparently! I have not measured this myself). I spend lots of time in a complete outage when they see no issues. Maybe this information is helpful in some way.

I have attached screenshots of the connection page from a freshly rebooted modem (MB8600) during a timeline of an outage. 

1. The first noticeable symptom is packet loss. Traffic makes it through in small fits and starts, but is not yet completely lost. 
2. The second symptom is complete loss of lock of all upstream channels. This is effectively an outage for me.
3. Eventually, the connection will recover. With luck, it will return to zero packet loss.
4. Sadly, it will eventually return to an outage over the next two minutes. 
5. The most interesting part to me is the large deviation in the OFDM PLC power level. It can be either exactly 7.7 or exactly 17.3 dBmV. When it is 17.3 dBmV, I have a connection. When it is 7.7 dBmV, I do not have a connection. I do not know enough about this to know how these things are correlated.
6. I will either have all upstream channels locked, or none of them. There is never a case where I have only 3 out of 4 locked, for example.

An complete upstream outage typically only lasts for anywhere from 3 minutes to 5 minutes before getting some lock on the upstream channels, even if that lock is only for a minute before it is lost again. This kind of ""up and down"" sputtering makes the internet effectively useless for anything other than emails which can queue in the inbox and offline document editing.

Attempted steps to remediate the problem:

1. I received new RG-11 cable from the node to my house.
2. I ran 2 new cables through my house to my modem, and have tested each one. One is an RG-6, one is an RG-11, they are both 100 ft. I am currently using the RG-11.
3. I got a second modem (SB8200), but experience the same outages. Getting to the configuration page was more tricky on this one, but I found that I can open the spectrum analyzer on port 8080, run it, then navigate to the configuration page. Funny way to ""jiggle the handle"".
4. An Xfinity tech has come out before and after the Comcast tech ran RG-11 from the node to my house to test signal levels.

The first Xfinity tech requested some kind of measurement on the node, and the second tech said that the upstream channels were at ""100% capacity"" on that node, and that it is possible I am being booted because there are not enough upstream channels to go around. I have no way to verify this, personally. He also said that there was a ticket to upgrade my node with a ""forecast date"" of October 28th, and that there was nothing he could do for my unfortunate situation.

Thank you for your time. I hope we can find a resolution."

I told it I was not calling about my home address, so it told me the numeric part of the second address and with that and my phone number I was able to find the other person's info. I've reached out to them and asked them to correct it, but have not heard anything back. Is it possible for Comcast to unlink my number from the other account, without the help of the owner of that account? It is frustrating because now I am associated with this other person in web searches and I am getting spam text messages from people trying to reach this other person.

My internet and cable has been out for a few weeks. I had a tech come out today to try and solve my internet and cable issues. He essentially said there is nothing he can do because there is either a short or a chew in the wire leading from the basement to my apartment that supplies the connection and that he can't work on it. The tech said someone would probably come out today to resolve it. Shortly after he left, I got a call from someone saying it would take 24-48 hours to SCHEDULE an appointment and that it is an outside contractor that will work on it. They used the generic comcast support number so there is no way I can get in contact with them to try and speed things up. I tried calling customer service, but no one can help me and they just keep on suggesting they schedule an appointment for a tech visit. 

I don't know what to do. I need the internet to do my job and given the pandemic, I can't even do something to pass the time. I'm at a loss and paying almost $200 a month for no service is deflating.

2020-07-28 19:36:58,Comcast_Xfinity,"I'm having intermittent, but severe packet loss and looking for technical help","Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I've been experiencing intermittent, but severe, packet loss for the past 2+ weeks.  This all began with an outage in my neighborhood on July 11th + 12th.  Since the outage was resolved, my internet has been flaky at best.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Symptoms:**

1. My internet becomes slow or unable to load websites.
2. My [https://www.xfinity.com/support/status](https://www.xfinity.com/support/status) page shows ""Cable Modem - **Issue Detected**"" and ""We're having trouble finding a signal"".
3. Pinging any reliable IP on the internet results in severe packet loss - 20-60%

**Troubleshooting steps I've performed:**

1. Power cycle my modem
2. Unplug my modem, unscrew the cable, reconnect after 60 seconds and plug back in.
3. Connect my computer via ethernet cable directly to the modem (to rule out router / wifi)
4. Spent 10+ hours of time with comcast support on the phone repeating the above 3 steps over and over again.
5. Purchase a brand new modem (Arris sb-8200) and replace old modem

&amp;#x200B;

These troubleshooting steps have all left me in the exact same place - Intermittent and severe lossy connection.

&amp;#x200B;

Is anyone able to help me troubleshoot further or help me engage comcast to help further? 

&amp;#x200B;

Great thanks!"

2020-07-27 12:40:33,Comcast_Xfinity,I lose internet several times a week for a minute or two,"I recently upgraded to 1Gb xFinity internet with a cable modem.  I have had the 300Mb internet plan with the same equipment for about 6 months prior to the change in service.

I am wired directly to the xFinity provided ARRIS TG3482G on my main home office computer.

Sometimes several times a day, sometimes a couple times a week, my internet just stops passing traffic.  I have continues pings running to my gateway (the modem), google, and the next hop after my cable modem.

When the internet traffic stops flowing, I am still able to ping my internal modem address, but both google and the next hope stop working.  It is common to see an occasional ping get a reply during this brief outage, but typically it will drop some 20-40 pings in a row, then it all will work fine again.

I have not logged into my modem while the problem is happening to see what it's connection to xFinity looks like.  This is a next step.

My question is, has anyone else seen this type of behavior after upgrading to faster speeds?  Is it worth trying to troubleshot this with xFinity support while the problem is not actively happening?"

The adapter that allows me to connect to wifi is broken and this means I have to use Ethernet. We got a second because the normal router (which will be refered to as the house router) has phone lines connected to it and is basically inside a wall cabinet

On my computer connection it would show the I was wired into the desk router next to me, however, when I checked the [10.0.0.1](https://10.0.0.1) website, the wifi SSID switched about every 30 seconds. It would switch back and fourth between the two. I am assuming this is causing the issue. We have some people coming out, but they are coming here to fix the house router which has issues keeping connection and cuts out. I want to be able to fix this problem just in the case it continues even after they work their magic on the house router. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

2020-07-26 13:23:44,Comcast_Xfinity,"Internet consistently going out, no way to get ahold of Representative","I am having trouble yet again with my Comcast service. I had this trouble a month or two ago, and it finally seemed resolved, but here we are. 

Internet goes out a few times a day, and a few times a week it will go out all day. Yesterday it was out (on and off all day - I was working in my kitchen next to my Nest and I could see it going on and off all day until I left at 5:30pm). It worked when I got home, and now it’s been off for about 3 hours. 

My main problem is that there is zero way of communicating with anyone at Comcast. Either the recording says there’s an outage and there’s nothing they can do to help, then disconnect, or say they’ll have someone call you back which never happens. Last week when this happened I stayed on hold for over an hour, in which time my internet came back on. The rep said that they couldn’t do much but they would monitor it all week and send tickets to their supervisor if they saw anything. I did have pretty good internet this past week, only noticed a few interruptions. 

When I asked if there was a better way to connect with a rep, they said to use the app. When I had chatted in the past on the app, once it worked and from then on (even just a few minutes later) said no one was available. The rep said to press troubleshooting, and that’ll get you connected with someone. I’ve done it twice today and even though they said someone would call in 45 mins, I still have no call hours later. 

What can I do? I’m so frustrated. I work a volunteer job from home and I am losing so many hours. I want to apply for a paying job, but it’s 100% internet based and cannot apply if I don’t have reliable internet. 

Thanks for listening!"

2020-07-15 11:27:19,Comcast_Xfinity,Experiencing area wide internet issues for over 2 months despite multiple calls to tech support.,"Hello,

I have been experiencing what appears to be an area wide internet issue for over 2 months. Multiple times a day, my internet goes completely out. It goes out for all devices on the network at the same time, including a desktop connected over an ethernet cable, a laptop connected over wifi, and my android smartphone connected over wifi. When the issue occurs I can log in to the Xfinity website using my smart phone data, and look at the outage map. Each time it is reporting a unplanned outage for my area affecting 51-500 users, affecting TV, Internet, and Voice.

 I first called support and reported the issue on May 12, although the issue starting occurring before that date. I was told they would open a ticket, and someone would look into the issue. I was given a ticket #  which I recorded. I called again on June 9th. The support agent confirmed she could see an outage on her end, took my phone number, and stated that someone would look into the issue and call me back. I never received a call back. Called again on July 11th, again was told I would receive a call back, and again never received one. I called again in the evening, and requested a tech  be sent out to investigate the issue. A tech was sent out July 13th, in the morning, who tested the line both outside and inside, and reported the line was fine, and there was nothing he could do about the issue. I asked who should I contact to initiate the next step of investigating the issue, and he gave me the name and number of his supervisor. I have called this supervisor 3 times over the last 3 days, left a voicemail each time, explaining the issue, leaving my phone number, and requesting he send someone out to further investigate the issue, and call me back. I have still not received a call back and the issue is still occurring.

The issue is continually getting worse each day. It goes down, 10-30 minutes later it comes back up. Stays up for a while, and than goes back down. The issue has affected me during work as well. Since I can't get anyone at comcast to even call me or explain what is going on, I can't even let my work know what the issue is, or when the issue might be fixed.

If you could please look into this issue for me I would really appreciate it. I've been a comcast customer for over 15 years, I haven't even asked for a discount on my bill while the internet is down. I'm just asking for someone to please look into the issue, and let me know what they have found.  If there are other customers who are higher priority , I understand. But this issue has been occurring for over 2 months now, and it needs to be fixed. 

Thank you for taking the time to read my post, I will be very grateful for any information or help you may be able to provide."

Person with a bucket truck did come out, but his bucket couldn't reach the pole from my driveway and he claimed the ground was too soft and he didn't want to get stuck so he would come back in a week.  Of course he has never been back.

The outages are generally fairly short lived, usually in the 5 to 10 minute range.  This is a problem because by the time I slog through the absolutely horrible voice response system and get to a person the outage has corrected itself.  The technician then tells me that if it isn't down while they are talking to me they cannot schedule a technician.

This is getting very frustrating.  I would appreciate any suggestions on how to solve the problem."

Lately we've noticed this often happens around 4pm, and last week I was sitting next to the modem during an episode. I watched the modem appear to reset itself at least once, maybe twice. One recent recent outage was longer than typical, about 1 hour from 12:30 to 1:30pm on July 9, confirmed by an external monitoring service and also reflected in the modem event log (which currently starts on 7/9). I have records from the modem status page showing downstream ""uncorrectable"" values ranging from 1000's to over 11,000,000, and similar to higher values for ""correctable"". Example from today attached, reflecting \~2 days since 7/9. Downstream SNR channels mostly in the 35-40 dB range, with one 21 dB. Power ranges 1.4-5.5 dBmv. I tried triggering a reset via the Comcast website today, and minutes later I see the uncorrectable/correctable values are on the rise again. I've unplugged/reset it many times in the last few weeks. 

Modem is connected via direct line from point of entry, is the only device connected to coax here, on a line originally installed by Comcast. I can send examples of the logs privately.

Up until about 10 days ago, the Xfinity speed test  ([https://speedtest.xfinity.com/](https://speedtest.xfinity.com/)) would show 1000 mbps +/- 50 Mbps. Running [speedtest.net](https://speedtest.net), I'd get 900+ Mbps. All was good...until I had an outage reported (by Xfinity via the app) about 10 days ago. Since then, my connection hasn't exceeded 120 Mbps on [speedtest.net](https://speedtest.net) or 300 Mbps on Xfinity's speed test.  My upload stays at the expected 40 Mbps. We've also had two more official outages reported by Xfinity for our area which were resolved within about an hour, but I haven't seen my speeds increase back to normal.

**Hardware**:

\- XB6 gateway (Arris TG3482G)

\- Computer capable of gigabit speed performance (wired into gateway or switch)

**Connection**:

I've tested both directly connected to the 2nd port of the gateway to my computer and through my gigabit 8 port switch (no difference). 

**Other info:**

Having contacted Xfinity support, the agent checked my channels and did the standard troubleshooting. No issues found/reported. The online auto-troubleshooting says no issues found. Restarting and changing port that the network cable is plugged into has no effect.

I've swapped the coax cable to a new one (supplied in my diy install kit from Xfinity) from the wall to my gateway with no noticeable differences (+/-1 SNR differences reported). 

I've not made any changes to my network for 3-4 months, so I don't think it was anything I did. My other computers on my network are seeing the same speeds when wired.

**Based on the Xfinity forums and this subreddit, it seems like I'm not alone in the seeing these sorts of reduced speeds lately while on the gigabit plan in the last few weeks. Is there additional troubleshooting I can perform?**

2020-06-22 14:03:15,Comcast_Xfinity,Fallen Wire Safety Issue!,I have a fallen xfinity wire drooping to the ground in my backyard. It has not caused an outage but I've been completely unable to get through to anyway to report this safety issue!
2020-06-21 19:02:31,Comcast_Xfinity,Does this really require a technician?,"There is currently an outage in my city, but when I checked the status center it said there were no outages reported near me. So I called just to make sure it was related to that and it wasn't something going on with my equipment since restarting didn't work. In chatting with the rep he told me that it was related to the outage, but that I would have to have a technician come to me to fix it. Is that actually the case? Because I am looking at the areas around me that are out of service and it says that 500+ customers are affected. Does a technician really have to go to each one of those addresses to reconnect their service? I am just really confused. If there's an outage and it's not my equipment, then why do I need a technician?"
2020-06-20 16:41:52,Comcast_Xfinity,Might be a dumb question but,"I noticed my internet going out for about 10 seconds seemingly randomly. I went to restart it and noticed the power cable wasn't plugged in completely. I'm not sure if that was the issue so, is it possible that would cause it?
There isn't an issue with the cable or anything, I just didn't plug it in all the way.
I also restarted it a few days ago because it actually did go out for a while. I still don't know if that was an outage or something else because my internet almost never goes out."

Since moving in with her since quarantine began, every day has intermittent DDoS over my line. I log it with PingPlotter, its always at xx:30 minutes on the day or xx:00 on the day and it lasts 5 minutes. 

Upgraded Internet package and it helped some but it has been present every day. Had a tech come out to review line, of course since its intermittent nothing was caught at the exact 2 minutes the tech was connected to the house, which also points to there being a problem with the Node in the neighborhood. I need to talk to an engineer as I have documented what's been going on and regular tech support wouldn't know what I'm talking about but the automated system is a nightmare."

2020-06-17 17:06:57,Comcast_Xfinity,Poor speeds and numerous drops throughout the day,"Good afternoon,

I recently had issues of T3 timeouts from a Motorola Surfboard router I previously used. The internet would drop for ~5 minutes several times throughout the day. I scheduled a tech who showed up, did some work, then left saying he's fixed it and any further issues would be a sign of the bad modem.

Fast forward a couple of weeks later and it starts up again. T3 timeout errors in the logs and constant outages. I purchased a new modem (Netgear CM700) and am still experiencing the same issues.

I'm most likely going to get another tech out to see what's going on, but I figured I'd reach out here first. I've included a sample of logs and power levels here:

https://imgur.com/a/dpyGr52

I had recently got off the phone with Xfinity and the robot rebooted the modem and stated everything should be okay. Shortly after I had another outage."
2020-06-17 03:04:22,Comcast_Xfinity,"Weeks of intermittent service, tech claims to have arrived today and now we have totally flatlined.","For about three weeks our service has been on and off. Sometimes it will be out for 12 hours or more. Restarting our equipment usually does nothing. Often, when we look up our area on the outage map, problems will be reported. And it’s not uncommon to see Comcast techs working on the pole right at the corner of our house the entire five years we’ve lived at this address. (Just a side note there.)

All our personal equipment was replaced at the same time less than two years ago. I know that isn’t the problem. I finally called yesterday and arranged an appointment. The rep said it looked like we might be having an interference problem?? What could they have meant by that, especially since they didn’t indicate it was likely an inside our home issue? 

Anyway, my text messages that same day said the tech came at 1pm but no one ever knocked and the rep said they would check outside first, which is what I wanted anyway. But I have no idea if they did or not. I received no follow up, no other texts, emails, no contact in person from this tech. And, in the 12 hours since they were here, our internet has not worked for a single solitary second. No matter how many times we’ve rebooted, rechecked it, etc. It’s DOA.

The biggest problem is, our cellphone coverage is already poor (IN THE MIDDLE OF TOWN, A BIG TOWN) and as of yesterday it seems they are throttling the hell out of us now. I can’t load the xfinity site fully, I can’t load the chat helpers, I can barely load gmail.

I’m super frustrated here. I need this problem fixed but it is increasingly getting harder to even find ways to seek out help because of the *problem*."
2020-06-16 16:50:34,Comcast_Xfinity,Ticket number prefix SI-,"Can anyone clarify what the prefix SI- is for tickets? Is that something where there's a widespread outage and it's for ""serious incident"" or something of that nature?  My understanding is CR is customer reference.  I guess I should confirm that as well while I'm asking.  Thanks!"
2020-06-15 22:42:40,Comcast_Xfinity,Outage map - persistent outage for several days,"My WiFi for days now seems to be affected by an outage in my zip code, according to the Xfinity outage map. It says 1-50 customers are affected. But then, in the same outage map screen, it shows there are ""no outages at my address"". So, conflicting information.

I chatted and some with someone at Xfinity who said ""it's your modem"" and was quick to send me a link of all of the Xfinity approved modems. This doesn't make sense because the modem I'd been using for years without issue is the same that is apparently now causing issues.
I asked him why and didn't get an answer. He then forwarded me to someone in the app support department to discuss the outage issue. But... My connection issue isn't because of the app. It's because I'm not getting any internet. 

My WiFi signal appears to be strong on my phone and laptop. However, when I tried to go to any websites, I am unable to load any pages. Router and modem have both been reset several times apiece. The router is brand new. I've also used it already with Xfinity internet with no issue.

Does anyone (Xfinity rep or no) actually know what might be going on?"
2020-06-13 21:42:41,Comcast_Xfinity,Intermittent upload stability &amp; outage.,"For the past... while now, I've been having issues with xfinity (blast, 1gbps down, 40 up) where my download stability seems to be working great (examples later) but my upload stability goes to crap for about 10-20 seconds.  It happens randomly, but it's pretty infuriating when it does.  I work from home like a lot of people now and I game at home too.  

The reason I know this is an ""upload only"" thing is because when I'm on conference calls, or discord, or in games, I can still hear/see what's going on.  But no one else is able to hear/see me.  Here are some specific examples:

* Discord/Teams/Slack: When I'm talking to someone, all of a sudden, they can't hear me anymore.  I either turn ""robotic"" or just cut out all together.  But I hear them just fine - ""Hello? you cut out, you still there? He must've cut out"".  10-20 seconds later, I'm back on and I can talk again, though the whole time I was able to hear them.
* Rocket League: When I'm playing a game, I will suddenly get a lag spike where I just start to see the cars continuing on their last action.  Typical for lag spikes, although the weird thing is, I can still see the chat and whether or not someone scored (via text alerts on the screen).  Eventually, I may time out and be kicked for idling...

Other examples are just random events happening where I'm disconnected randomly.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to call and have someone ""reset"" my modem, have people come out to look at my stuff, but it always is fine for a few weeks and then something starts happening again.  I even rented the xfinity equipment to make sure I wasn't the issue.  My PC is wired directly to the modem and my laptop (for work) is wireless.  I restart the modem pretty consistently and I still get the drops.  My blood pressure sky rockets when I have to call the automated system and it tells me I need to reset my modem then asks if the problem was fixed... I don't know if it was fixed until I see this issue again.  So I go through and finally talk to someone.  They ""reset"" it and then the next time I'm on, it happens again.

&amp;#x200B;

Besides calling and repeating the same process over and over, I'm at a loss of what to do.  Any ideas?  Are there any direct lines? Is this a common problem?"
2020-06-12 14:16:23,Comcast_Xfinity,Signal issues after a major ~15 hour outage,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently having some signal issues and hope someone can assist. About 2 weeks ago there was a major outage in my area that caused both TV and Internet to go down for about \~15 hours. ever since my service was restored i am now seeing a very high Upstream power level anywhere from 53-59db (shown on both the modem signal page and x1 dvr signal page below). it hit 59db last night around midnight but i unfortunately did not grab a screenshot of it. Before the outage my signal levels were fine (upstream never went above 49) and the modem would stay up for weeks/months unless there was maintenance or an outage.

&amp;#x200B;

I have checked and tightened every coax cable in the apartment (behind the wall plates too) as well as tightened the connections where the main line comes in to my apartment. I had a major issue with packet loss about 8 months ago and had multiple techs (6 to be exact) out until finally getting a senior manager and technicians to visit. They replaced and checked every connection in the apartment so i am 99.9% sure this issue is NOT with the wiring in my apartment and may have to do with an outside/node/plant issue somewhere upstream (especially since everything was PERFECT before the outage, then the signal for both downstream and upstream changed. so they must have adjusted the signal(s) ).

&amp;#x200B;

I believe these numbers need to be checked and changed somewhere upstream. while my modem is staying online (for now...) i am seeing some issues with both speed and latency (high ping, lag, etc) . From what i understand, weather,especially high temperatures, can cause the upstream power to increase? im in Florida so unfortunately we deal with 90+ degree temps during the summer :( . As i said, the numbers for down/upstream were perfect before this huge outage so i doubt the issue is heat.

&amp;#x200B;

Any help with this would be GREATLY appreciated before this gets worse / hotter during the summer. I am truly convinced this issue is not with just my apartment and more of a wide area issue. the picture attached (below) is a screenshot of the signal page right after a reboot hoping/thinking the upstream levels would magically fix itself lol. if there is anymore information i can provide to you please let me know.

&amp;#x200B;

thank you for your time and patience and please stay safe!

2020-06-11 08:35:18,Comcast_Xfinity,Unstable Connection,"Between May 10 - 20 ""something"" (not sure if it was an upgrade or a repair, but something gave an outage notification on the Xfinity app) happened that caused a drop-in service at my home. Up until then, my Arris SB6121 had served me reliably for several years. I reach out to support, only to be told my plan had been upgraded and my Modem would not work for my current plan. In reality, it worked fine but was not capable of the 200mbps plan which was fine. It was reliable and stable, but I planned to upgrade it anyways and got an Arris SB8200.

Since around May 20, my internet has been unstable.

Activating my SB8200 was a challenge.

The first SB8200 I purchased from Amazon (not refurbished, renewed, or from a reseller). which they report they got it directly from Arris was already registered with Comcast ...

The replacement arrived and an agent was able to Activate it (At least I think he did) without much fuss.

However, I have noticed a few things, they might be related to the unstable connection or nothing at all.

1. The Arris SB8200 is a DOCSIS 3.1 and DOCSIS 3.0 modem. The documentation reads that the 2nd and 3rd lights from the top will light up Blue for 3.1 and Yellow for 3.0. Down shows Blue (3.1) and Up shows (3.0)
2. Occasionally my connection tanks and- My downstream goes from between 220 Mbps to 180 Mbps, down to between 30Mbps  to 50Mbps- My upstream goes from between 12 Mbps to 10 Mbps down to less than 1 Mbps
3. The Xfinity app does not Detect the modem as online (nor any of the TV receivers for that matter...)

Here is the connection readout

&amp;nbsp;

# Issue Details

### Behavior

Internet connection goes down for ~5-45 seconds, on average ~1-5 times *(sometimes more)* an hour. Once it starts happening *(see __Possible Correlation__ below)* it appears to be at random, happening at all hours. I've been monitoring this with [Net Uptime Monitor](https://netuptimemonitor.com/) and [Ping Tracer](https://github.com/bp2008/pingtracer) and have provided logs and graphs below.

### Effect on HTTP traffic

Websites fail to load, YouTube or YouTube TV pauses if the outage is longer than the buffer.

### Effect on SSH traffic

Connections to remote servers are aborted.

### Effect on online gaming

Tested with Counter-Strike Source. Game freezes, other players freeze, I'm unable to move my player. It acts like a giant lag spike, but **_voice chat continues to work_** - I can still hear other players talking without interruption while frozen.

&amp;nbsp;

# Equipment

* Modem: Arris TG3482G
* Router: [Mikrotik RB4011iGS+5HacQ2HnD](https://mikrotik.com/product/rb4011igs_5hacq2hnd_in) *(router was bypassed during troubleshooting and the issue persisted)*

  - Graph is a traceroute to Level 3 (`4.2.2.2`). `10.10.10.1` is the gateway for the Mikrotik router.
- Log excerpt: https://pastebin.com/raw/1yjSuQ8V

&amp;nbsp;

# Troubleshooting Attempts

- Disconnected power from modem and router for 1 min. Reconnected power to modem, waited for it to boot up, then connected power to router.
- Factory reset the modem.
- Hooked directly to the modem in non-bridge mode, bypassing the Mikrotik router.

&amp;nbsp;

# Possible Correlation

- The modem's gateway address (`10.0.0.1`) does not respond to pings, nor does the web UI load (connection times out). The only time it does is during the first few hours of uptime after it's been rebooted or factory reset. Once the uptime exceeds that, `10.0.0.1` stops responding/loading.
- In relation to the above, **_it appears the random outages start to happen once the modem's gateway address stops responding to pings._** Yesterday I unplugged the modem and plugged it back in and started traceroutes with Ping Tracer to both Level 3 (`4.2.2.2`) and the modem gateway (`10.0.0.1`). The connection lasted 6 hours before the first outage. Both traceroutes started timing out at the same time:
  - https://i.imgur.com/gNqUmBG.png _(1st outage)_
  - https://i.imgur.com/hCapAwq.png _(2nd outage. From this point on pings to the gateway timed out, and the connection began going down randomly, [48 times in the past 16 hours](https://pastebin.com/raw/sXs3izm7))_

Comcast keeps crediting my account $20 each month but I make almost double that every hour for my job and I've got almost 15 hours of internet downtime in the middle of the day each month.

In that time, our internet experiences an outage every 2-3 days for a few hours - noticeably during the working day (I can’t speak to overnight hours as I’m sleeping). 

Today is the 5th day that our house is experiencing an outage for a few hours. Having to work from home, we are paying for premium service to ensure we get the right speeds - but we can’t work if there’s no internet! 

Calling hasn’t helped since all we get is a message that says there’s an outage, we have tried chatting with the bots, Twitter, and am now on Reddit as a last hope. 

I have some questions I hope someone can help me with: 

1. Why are these outages happening almost daily now? 

2. Is this something I need to pay business class rates to ensure it doesn’t happen?

3. What can be done to ensure that our internet is stable, even if we are throttled, we can’t afford to continue to hour hours of no service daily! 

4. Is there a way to get prorated costs for the lack of service? 

5. Is there a way to get out of our 12 month contract without paying a penalty fee?

2020-06-01 13:14:19,Comcast_Xfinity,Frequent cable modem disconnects for the last month,"After 1.5 years of rock-solid Gigabit service, I've been experiencing very frequent modem disconnects - all starting about a month ago when there was a noted outage (for about an hour) on the Xfinity site. I have my own equipment and nothing was changed, splitters/cables all re-seated and checked. Modem is an Arris SB8200.

I've been through hours and hours of online chats, waiting in the Advanced Queue multiple times, never receiving promised callbacks. A tech has supposedly checked the outside twice (last week), was told they fixed some ""storm damage"" and all looks good.

However, I can see my Upstream power levels get beyond 55 dBmV and I'm reasonably certain that is the issue - there is something going on with the lines outside causing this signal degradation. People in my general area have complained of similar loss of service.

There's yet another tech scheduled to come out in an hour - they never make contact with me as they're supposed to, so I can't even talk with them to ask if they've looked at these power levels. I'd really appreciate some help from a Comcast rep that can take control of this issue and restore my service to what it was. I've already sent ModMail and was asked to post this message to start the process.  Thanks so much for any help!"

That call never came, and another chat agent told me they would call from 7am - 9pm in the next 24-48 hours, which to me is a laughable timeframe for anyone. I'm coming up on around the 38 hour mark and still no call. 

Troubleshooting steps I've taken:

1. Unplug modem, plug back in
2. Unplug modem, move to other room with coax, plug back in
3. Inspect cables from the connection to the pole
   1. There might be an issue here. Where the cable comes away from the house and out towards the pole, it runs through a tree. The tree seems to be growing into the connections pole-side.
4. Confirmed my modem is appropriate for usage with comcast/xfinity

If someone could help, I'd certainly appreciate it."
2020-05-29 08:41:14,Comcast_Xfinity,Total service outage same day/time each week.,"I just woke up this (Friday) morning to a total service outage (internet, cable, phone). The thing is the exact same thing happed Friday morning two weeks ago, and three weeks ago.  The service outage map on the website says the same thing every time, 51-500 affected, but it just shows my house with no shaded affected area. 

Anyone ever experience this?  Could a support rep please dm me for details and maybe see what's going on here?  Thanks."
2020-05-28 14:10:46,Comcast_Xfinity,Now over 24hrs without TV/Phone/internet,"since Sunday we have been experiencing intermittent network outages where the TV phone and TV go out.
But then yesterday (Wednesday) morning, they went out for good. So now I can't work remotely.
I had seen the Xfinity tech outside and he said he was working on it and it was affecting the entire building block.
It's now Thursday morning and another where I can't do my work remotely and I see the tech again and he said he has fixed the issue but we now have to call support to send out techs to visit every house individually.
So we went from intermittent network outages to full outage but somehow he has fixed it but we still need to get another tech to fix what he made worse!
I now call support and I might not have a tech come out here for another couple of days.
I've never seen anything like this before."
2020-05-28 05:28:35,Comcast_Xfinity,Sketchy lil Xfinity...,"Service went down this evening (still is). 

Outages section of the website says outage in my area, reason being “routine maintenance”. 

However; when clicking over to the outage map, it has a line where it says if it’s a planned or unplanned outage - and it says UNPLANNED.

So... it’s ‘Unplanned routine maintenance’.

Hmmm.  Alright."
2020-05-27 21:41:39,Comcast_Xfinity,"Brief Power Outage, now my X1 box shows no connect but modem still works","So today we had a very brief (5 minute?) power outage.  When the power came back on, my internet started up just fine, but my X1 box reboots and says that there is no connection.  Obviously reset it multiple times to see if that helped to no avail.  Later called Comcast support and they did a system refresh and when it still said it wasnt connected on their end, set up a service visit in 2 days. 

The modem and X1 box are both on the same connection, it comes out the wall plate and then uses a splitter to go into the modem and cable box.  I have not touched the wires or messed with the connection in any way so I am not sure why the connection would fail.

Also, while there is still just a purple error screen that says to check the connection, for some reason a box popped up on the bottom that says the following:

&amp;#x200B;

* FW Version: AX013AN\_4.0p12s2\_PROD\_sey
* ECM MAC: 5c:e3:0e:91:fc:37
* ECM IP:  (this is blank)
* ESTB MAC: 5C:E3:0E:90:BB:7B
* ESTB IP: (this is also blank)

I don't know if that means anything, but I figured I would include it.

Anyways, I read a few brief mentions about possible issues after a power outage but nothing that helps me figure out how to fix.  Any advice??"
2020-05-27 14:18:20,Comcast_Xfinity,Power issue,I had a power outage in my area recently due to a storm. I followed the instructions that was on the Xfinity website and got a text message saying that my service has been restored but whenever I plug the modem to the wall it doesn’t turn on at all. Plugged in for more than an hour and into different outlets but not a single light was switched on.

Your website says there is an “outage” and it will be resolved at exactly 3:05am. How many times are you planning on doing this? Why didn’t you send me an email or something before hand so I could at least plan around it. This is clearly intentional maintenance or something, not an outage.

2020-05-18 21:08:31,Comcast_Xfinity,"How to report extremely low hanging cable line (safety hazard, but not emergency)","Hello! I'm looking for some guidance and I'm hoping someone here can help. I have a very low hanging cable line that cuts directly across my field to a neighbors house. Over the last few years this cable has gotten lower and lower to the point where it is currently low enough at one point that I could stand under it, jump, and touch it.

This is an issue because there is often equipment used around this line and it has almost been torn down a couple of times which I'm sure would cause an outage for my neighbors, and I'm sure in its current state it will accidentally be torn down by a piece of equipment in the future.

How do I report this and get it resolved? I've called the 800 number twice over the past few years, as well as submitted an online ticket and no one ever responds back or appears to fix the line. I've even provided the pole # a few times, as I suspected the initial confusion was that the offending pole is a few hundred feet from my service address.

Any suggestions on how to get this resolved? I'm afraid the cable is going to get torn down this year by someone driving equipment under it and possibly cause injury or an extended outage for my neighbors."
2020-05-16 02:44:06,Comcast_Xfinity,Extremely Slow Speeds and Dropped Connections Since Techs Did Work in Our Neighborhood,"I am at my wits' end, so I am hoping someone has an idea of how to end this nightmare. I have the Performance Pro+ plan with Xfinity, so I am supposed to be getting up to 200 Mbps down. Yes, I know it's ""up to,"" but when my internet is working properly, I usually do get at least 180 Mbps during peak hours and 200+ during off-peak hours.

In mid-March, we had an outage. I checked the online status center, and it said that techs were in our area doing repairs. I got a text about an hour later saying that service had been restored. Well, it was technically restored--I could get online again. But ever since then, my speeds have been incredibly slow and I have been having all kinds of crazy problems. 

* Slow speeds: Sometimes speed tests show results of 1.5 Mbps down or maybe 15 or 20. I occasionally get 180+, but that is few and far between. Even when the speed test shows a good result, my connection is unstable/Internet is slow.
* Unstable connection: Sometimes when I run a speed test, it will jump up to 20 or 30 Mbps at first and then immediately drop down to 0.0, even when I use Xfinity's speed test, which usually gives better results than other tools.
* When I try to log in to the router admin panel, it's showing me someone else's SSID. The user name and password I set up don't work since it's not the SSID I created. I can get around this by holding the gateway reset button for 15 seconds and then setting it up as if it's an entirely new device. The problem is that it doesn't last. Within 10 or 15 minutes of setting it up as a new device, it starts displaying the other SSID again. The kicker is that sometimes it shows my SSID and then switches to the other person's SSID when I am in the middle of trying to do something. For example, I log in under my SSID, I click Troubleshooting, and then I click Logs, but I can't go any further because it says ""You must log in!"" and then when it takes me back to the login page, it's showing the other SSID again, so my user name and password don't work.
* There are anywhere from 50 to 110 devices connected to my network every time I check. We have maybe 10 devices in our house (laptops, desktop, Roku stick, Kindle Fire, Kindle Paperwhite, PS4, two iPhones).
* Every time I have called Xfinity about this and they have tried to send a signal to my modem, the tech says the signal isn't going through.
* One of the few times I was able to get in my router admin panel, I checked the logs, and it showed no activity at all except on two days I reset the gateway and set it up as a new device. It also shows my data usage as 0 for the month of April and the first half of May, which is impossible since despite the slow speeds and other problems, I have been using the internet every day. I went from 400-500GB of data usage in Feb. and March to nothing after this problem started.
* A hardwired connection doesn't seem to work any better than wireless. When I turn off the wireless and connect directly to the gateway, I might get slightly faster speeds (say 20 vs. 15), but I am not getting anywhere near what I should be getting.

Based on all this, it seems like they've got my service crossed with someone else's or there is an IP conflict or something like that, but I just don't know enough to troubleshoot too much on my own. Xfinity won't send out a tech since I have SOME service (due to COVID-19), so I am basically stuck with this problem until they start sending out techs again. So far, their only solution has been to get a new gateway. I got a new gateway in March after this started, and then I got another new one in April (after the tech tried to send a signal and it wouldn't go through)."
2020-05-14 23:30:42,Comcast_Xfinity,Connection Issues,"Tonight my modem kept going offline then back online. Connection has been solid for awhile. 96 days before I reset the modem/lost connection tonight (based on modem info before I power cycled the device). 

After checking all the connections inside the house and attic I checked the MyAccount App. No outage detected. Did a modem signal reset. 

I’ve been back online for over 30 minutes but the upstream power levels don’t look good. Haven’t seen them this high in awhile. Downstream look okay though. 

Any advice?

2020-05-14 19:02:43,Comcast_Xfinity,Modem suddenly unable to connect,"Hello, I had connectivity issues a few months ago and bought a new sb6183 and things have been fine since. After some reported outages over the last day, which have now been cleared, my internet never came back and now I'm now getting the following errors and waiting on a tech to come out, but if at all possible, would love to avoid that. I have cycled the modem many times, reset to factory defaults (which doesn't seem to do much), confirmed my MAC/SN with online support, and had them ""send me signals"". They said they could not see any communication from my modem.

2020-05-14 14:13:55,Comcast_Xfinity,Complete outage west Colorado Springs.,[removed]
2020-05-14 12:52:42,Comcast_Xfinity,What just happened? Next step for my account?,"So I have had a frustrating day with Comcast customer support, and it's no cause of the service centers or agents themselves. For whatever reason, my account just had a glitch or some issue. I'll explain. But I do not work with Comcast issues much and would like to hear if there's a better way to do things? Anyway...  


I'm moving. Or, I am going to be moving. I was originally moving this past weekend and scheduled my Xfinity service transfer accordingly. During the first day of moving, I found out my sister tested positive for COVID-19 and had to be tested myself. During this time I cancelled all of my plans and texted back to the Comcast SMS confirmation of my appointment to cancel or reschedule. I get a text back saying that 'there are multiple address with this mobile number, please confirm zip code"" I go through the prompts, and keep getting stuck in a loop of ""select from the options below"". I tried 4 times to reschedule the appointment by text so then I go on my Xfinity account online and I get ""You have no appointments scheduled"". So I don't think anything of it.  


Come the day for the appointment, I get notified that the technician has arrived and is working. They finish before I can call them and I get a call from Comcast. It's an agent, and he saying that he notices I'm still online at my old address and wanted to know if I wanted to push activation to the new address. He explains doing this will cancel and shutdown service at the old address. I explain to him how I'm pending results for COVID-19 and had to push the move a week or two further down the road and tried to cancel the tech. He said that he'll leave it pending and that when I'm ready to move, I should call back to finish activation. He also mentioned that the TV and Phone service will be down in the meantime. I only use Internet (it was cheaper when bundled) so this is no issue. 7:30am the next day my service got shutdown at the old address and I have a webpage that automatically opened asking me to activate my service.

I call customer service and after 4 attempts of wandering through the various prompts (and getting 15+ text messages for self-help) I get in line for a call-back from an agent. The agent explains somehow the service got pushed for the new address and the only way to get my old address back online is to set up a new account. Which we did, just for Internet. She then says she cannot do the rest here, and transfers me to technical support who then puts me on a call-back list. 45 minutes later, I get a call back. After re-confirming account information and explaining that my 'old address' is really my 'new address', we get to the point of adding my modem. I use my own modem/route/gateway combination. I gave her the MAC address information and she tells me it's still linked to the other account. Until this old account (pushed to the new address) is disconnected and cancelled, she cannot add the modem to it. The only other way is for me to go and purchase a new modem. (comparable model is about $350). Unable to help, she disconnects and wishes me well.  


I then attempt to get a hold of another agent 10 more times before giving up after the automatic service restarts my modem 4 times and refuses to send me to an agent until I can show my modem is actually connected at an address I physically am not at. Eventually I disconnect my modem and reconnect it to get the same 'finish activating your service'. I follow this on my own and get it to activate for the correct old address for ""voice only service"" but now have my Internet per what the 1st agent said she'd set my new account up for. This 'new account' has all my old information and original contract date.  


My question is this, now that I have two separate accounts, did I just screw myself even more? My current plan is to cancel this service at the apartment in a week or two. Will I end up paying for two months at a time?

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot get through Comcast customer service phone lines to get ahold of anyone, so I will try again once I get bored. Right now, after spending 3 hours trying to get ahold of an agent, I gave up and ended up here. To be frank, the only reason I am still trying on this is because Xfinity has a monopoly in the area for Internet service. AT&amp;T cannot offer the package that Xfinity can, and therefore I am stuck. I already received quotes and attempted to disconnect my Xfinity service 3 times (I honestly still am debating taking a 150MBps speed and unlimited data cap cut to get rid of Xfinity) but cannot do it unless I get ahold of an agent - which I cannot. I went as far as figuring out how to block payments with my bank, but now that I got service I think I'll be ok. Just to clarify, I do need Internet for my job - which is why I need to figure out what's going on before I risk another outage. Today was about 3 1/2 hours without Internet which was no harm, no foul, but very inconvenient.

Do I need to do any other actions to my account? Or should I just wait the 2 weeks and activate the old account at the new address and just cancel the new service? If I get stuck paying for both, can I request a credit for the cost? I only am using one address and the other is just an empty house that's pending Internet activation. TV is active over there, as of today, which I think is what killed my service to begin with. I have nothing over there and did not do the activation.  


Thanks!"
2020-05-14 11:31:37,Comcast_Xfinity,Service outage with no estimated time,I’m in north seattle Washington and my services all went out (local outage affecting 2500+ not just me) last night and the estimated fix time went from 9pm to 6am to nothing now. The chat feature on their mobile website (including with a person) gave me no information and I’m curious if I can find out what happened and get some kind of estimate on fix time. My wife and I both have to work from home now and we have two kids in school as well so this isn’t just so we can Netflix.
2020-05-13 02:09:59,Comcast_Xfinity,Error 500 when trying to refresh (no internet),"I lost internet over an hour ago and tried refreshing my modem of restarting it via the refresh signal but I get a 500 error and I can't send the signal. I also called in to get one sent but it doesn't seem to be making it through to my modem because the lights don't change.

They are sending out a technician but I feel like it could be a waste of time I've never had a problem that required a physical solution in 13+ years always an outage but I'm showing no outages but no modem connection through my account."

Called comcast and they sent a tech yesterday, he didn't even check anything and simply told me that there isn't outage but the node has been running out of capacity since everybody is WFH and the only thing I can do is to wait, keep the modem on and ""wait like in a line in a restaurant"" and ""wish somebody just disconnects until I can get online"". I've been since waiting for 24 hours and never got connected. The thing is, he doesn't know when this can be fixed.

2020-05-09 23:17:51,Comcast_Xfinity,No way of contacting an actual employee,Absolutely ridiculous. I just got xfinity about a week ago. I bought the 600 mbps plan and have only been getting 250 mbps MAX. the only other device would be my TV and I never use that. Now my speeds are only hitting 50 mbps max even when I reset the modem (several times) and sometimes goes down to less than 1 mbps. Xfinity shows that there is no outage going on so there's no excuse. It's also apparently impossible to get in touch with a human employee. What's going on?
2020-05-08 15:27:01,Comcast_Xfinity,Comcast’s response to an almost week-long outage,"On Sunday, May 3rd a storm rolled through my neighborhood that knocked out power and internet. A couple of days later power was restored but our internet was still out. The xfinity website and app both reported outages, however, the timer for when it would be resolved is pushed back every 12 hours. 

In that time I made four phone calls to Comcast (I only spoke to a live agent once). The automated system detected my outage based off my phone number and tried to tell me that a service agent wouldn’t be able to help me resolve the issue. This was my first red flag. Basically, after the system detected the outage it wouldn’t let me contact an agent via the same call. Eventually I figured out that I had to schedule a callback via their website. 

The first agent callback seemed apologetic but couldn’t get me any real answers. He didn’t know what caused the outage nor did he know when it would fixed. Yesterday, our service came back for a few hours immediately following that call. Then it was promptly cut off and hasn’t returned since. The outage map said it would be resolved around 10:30AM the next day. 

Today, I checked the outage map and it said it would resolved by 10:48PM. I scheduled another call back only to get more atrocious customer service responses.

The agent on the line asked me if I was experience tv or internet outages (1. They should be able to detect that on their side). I said we only use internet, and her response was to plug the XFINITY Stream app along with all the devices I could use it on. This absolutely made my blood boil. I HAVENT HAD INTERNET IN 5 DAYS. Just like the last agent she had no answers for me and couldn’t contact anyone to get to work on our outage. 

This is unacceptable. At the very least give me an answer for what is causing the outage. Additionally, pushing back the timer every twelve hours isn’t any good. If you need a few days, just tell me that. Don’t try to plug your other shitty services while the expensive one I already pay for isn’t working. The automated system barring me from speaking to a real person unless I bypassed it by either using the billing prompt or scheduled a separate callback isn’t a positive experience either.

This entire experience makes me want to cancel my service and move to another company. I have a feeling that AT&amp;T will be able to activate and install my service before Comcast will do anything about it."
2020-05-07 21:13:39,Comcast_Xfinity,Tree on comcast line. Cannot get in touch with Comcast.,"Our house was in a line of storms that put a lot of our city out of power (most of which is now fixed). During this a tree took out the line that leads to our house. We cannot get in touch with comcast to fix this as there is “an outage in our area” so we only receive an automated message. How can we ensure that Comcast knows there is broken wire in the road?

2020-05-06 04:04:26,Comcast_Xfinity,Constant T-3 Time-outs and Packet Loss.,"Hello,

I keep getting T-3 time outs in my modem's event log. The channels frequency and power are fine, there just seems to be interference with my connection. I've had this problem before twice already this year, and this is the third time this has happened. The first time I've had a couple techs come in, the first one told me it might be a modem issue, but I got a new modem and the problem was not fixed.

Internet goes down for 15-20 minutes at a time. System reports an outage, then resolves it within 15-20 minutes, then internet goes down again. I can't report it on the website or on the phone. This has been happening to me and other neighbors for the last week.

Here is PingPlotter I ran overnight, [https://share.pingplotter.com/DHjzzkSHArg](https://share.pingplotter.com/DHjzzkSHArg).

I've had Xfinity internet for years with very few issues. I even upgraded to Gigabit a month ago and I have been very happy with it. Consistently getting above 900 Mbps down and 40 Mbps up.

However, we had a couple of short \~1-hour service outages in the past week. The status page reported that a technician was working in our area and the outage map showed a number of local outages. Since then, my connection has significantly degraded. I noticed my upload speed had dropped and when playing online on my Xbox One became unplayable due to lag. Streaming video and typical web browsing still work, with the occasional hiccup.

I'm using an Arris SB8200 connected to a Google Wifi router. My main computer is hardwired to the router and all my testing has been performed on that machine to eliminate wireless interference.

I power cycled my modem and router several times, with no improvement.

Here is my recent speed history collected by my router. (notice the upload speed drop starting May 1)

2020-04-22 13:13:19,Comcast_Xfinity,Comcast XB6 Internet Real Outage and Latency (With Graphs) (issues),"So, I've had numerous issues with this setup on XB6, I'm on my third modem. (first was a gen 1 rainbow, it fried itself, second was a gen 2 that had a bad flash from an apparent update that comcast forced, which the technician acknowledged).  I work from home, and Comcast refuses to acknowledge any issues with this setup. It's not the modem, it's their backbone network. I called up and got a tiny credit because they literally told me that I'd have to call up every time I have an issue, well this is so intermittent if you look at the graphs I'd spend the majority of my days on the phone with them. It's interesting, the latency spikes, they force ip changes, I had 3 new ips in a single day.

This is a network issue on their end and for the price we pay them per month, this is absolutely absurd not to mention piss poor service. I get drop outs, however it's not a true connection drop, the latency spikes through the roof and sits there, then settles down. I figured I'd finally show people what these speed issues really are, if you think you're getting gig, you're sadly mistaken. I think maybe 25% (If I could get fios, I would but I'm stuck with this) of the time WHEN it works I receive it. It would be nice if a rep or someone would take a look at this post. Because I'm sick of being told to empty my browser cache. I run 1gb and 10gig cisco switches, modem is in bridge mode. The issue isn't on my end, I checked the signals, all looks good, but these drop outs are absurd.

Especially working from home with this virus, I can't maintain constant connections to several vpns, time outs, connection drops, it occurs consistently.

Yes this is a bandwidth testing, but at the same time, I see the exact same issues with latency corresponding. So figured I'd show people, there are issues in Maryland with the service, and they refuse to acknowledge it.

When the outage cleared I was still only receiving the same channels. When I called in the automated system wanted to send a refresh signal before connecting me to an agent. After the refresh signal I lost the channels that I still had.

I spent an hour on the phone with an agent and it was discovered that I could view channels 633 through 658 (which I've never watched and didn't know I had), but nothing else.

Most channels are giving ""Channel temporarily unavailable. Contact your cable provider for more information. D261"" The agent I worked with couldn't find anything in their system about that error.

As it does not appear to be the Tivo, nor cablecard, nor their remote configuration they are going to try and schedule a tech, but that's a longer process than usual because of the times in which we're living.

2020-04-16 08:25:34,Comcast_Xfinity,WiFi disconnects 3-4 times a day and requires a reset to reconnect. Ethernet MOSTLY works.,"Frustrating problem for the past week. The wifi router on my XB6 disconnects 1-5 times a day, usually in the evening, ‪starting at 7-8pm‬, and sometimes midday on the weekends. Nothing at home changed recently.

Spoke to and chatted with support 4-5 times, and even got a new gateway swapped in but the problem persists.

When the wifi goes offline, it doesn’t come back on its own without me having to do a gateway reset. Having to walk over to my laptop that’s wired in, to reset my gateway 2-3 times while watching “Kingdom” is not a great experience.

The strangest thing is: when the wifi goes out, the ethernet to several devices still works perfectly, while a couple of devices over ethernet refuse to work (the PS4 and an Apple TV).

I have one MacBook Pro that works 100% of the time, even when wifi is down and the gateway knocks some of the other ethernet-connected devices offline. Another MacBook connected via Ethernet also works consistently. Mostly an Apple house, with lots of iPads and iPhones - all lose connection when the WiFi is out, so we switch to tethering from the cellular data.

My gateway: Arris XB6, version 15

My home: 800 square foot, wood frame apartment on one level.

Complications: I have a TP-Link wifi extender to allow my nest cameras to get signal (they can’t connect to the gateway, which is in the center of the house). When the gateway is near the cameras, I can’t get good signal in the back of the house, so it has to stay in the center. NOTE: when wifi is out, the extender continues working with no issues - I can connect to my Nest cameras from my laptop or my cel phone and monitor them during a wifi outage.

I’ve got 15-20 smart home devices which rely on the WiFi and cause the most pain, since the alexas are unresponsive and some lights won’t function.

I recognize Xfinity sells a mesh solution, but I’m not inclined to use that solution since I’ve read dozens of threads with folks having my same issue, even with XFi Pods installed. Feels like some kind of strange DHCP issue - as the event logs keep showing DHCP errors during wifi issues), but I need help.

Here are my power stats from the gateway:

After long enough of being annoyed by this I turned the modem off, waited about a minute and turned in back on.  Now we have No internet at all. I have tried rebooting multiple times to no avail. This is about the 3rd or 4th time this exact situation has happened since the Covid-19 situation started up. I don't know the logic behind losing internet totally by rebooting (unless xfinity is deciding to only let so many people on the network at a given time to help with bandwidth issues). This is kind of ridiculous. Last few times this has happened it has been down for 2 to 3 hours. Grrr arg."

I see that current promo for 100 mbps/125+ is $85/month without agreement and am hoping to get that. I've been told that I cannot and the agent encouraged me to explore other options like Hulu/Google Fiber. This was after mentioning that those would save me considerable money. 

Any help would be appreciated. If it truly isn't possible then we will likely cancel service and give it a shot going without cable. I'd rather not but with the current economic situation it's hard to justify $155+/month on TV/internet.

A thunderstorm knocked power to parts of Montgomery Co., VA, [just few days ago](https://www.martinsvillebulletin.com/news/local/high-winds-storms-downs-trees-cause-power-outages-in-patrick-henry-counties/article_d9518118-8e6d-5eae-b5d7-5fbc4efa7d8a.html).  Power was restored within a few hours, but my internet service has been having issues ever since.  The Xfinity speed test (pictured below) confirms that there is no outage in my area, however I'm still experiencing technical difficulties getting connected.  I've gone through all the usual steps to restore internet service, including restarting my modem &amp; router, buying a new router, buying a new modem, and I have still not been able to successfully connect.

But the plot thickens: when I plug my TV directly into the modem with an ethernet cable, I'm able to watch YouTube on the TV's built-in YouTube app.  However, connecting the same ethernet cable directly to my MacBook tells me that ""the device on the other end is not responding"", and my router (both old and brand new) are unable to connect through the modem to setup a network.

While talking with customer support, one of the reps mentioned that there were ""upgrades"" in my area that might affect service, and I'm worried that a change or upgrade on the Xfinity side has made it so my modem is no longer compatible with the service (but then why wouldn't a brand new modem work?).  The other thing I can think of is that the wiring between the box and my house has been degraded or damaged, although that wouldn't explain how my TV is still able to connect.

Can you help me resolve this mystery?  Is there a way to determine device compatibility with the Xfinity network?  The make and model of my devices are listed below:

Modem: Arris Surfboard SB6183

Router: Netgear AC1750

2020-04-07 11:59:41,Comcast_Xfinity,Evidence Comcast appears to be throttling up-link?,"Hello - I pay for Gigabit internet in the Denver area and over the last week my upload speeds have consistently been \~5mbps. No matter the time of day (tested throughout peak hours and 1am and 5:30am) I'm consistently getting up-link speeds consistent with the Performance Pro tier. 

I've gone through troubleshooting with 2 agents over chat and they've done multiple tests and can't find anything wrong. 2 of my neighbors with Gigabit have also reported the same issues. 

The agents have reassured me that Comcast is not throttling up-link but also say they can't send technicians to check the fiber lines on the street unless there is a complete outage. I completely understand not sending technicians out to houses and I fully support that however at this point with the consistent upload speeds being brought down 2 tiers we are becoming more and more suspicious. 

I know I'm complaining about 5mbps upload but I do work from home full time (as does my partner now) and compared to the 35mbps upload we normally have it's becoming difficult to do my job. Zoom is reporting 160x90 resolution and never sending more than 200kb/s. 

I previously had CenturyLink symmetrical gigabit before moving and my friends are not reporting any issues with CL. I'm paying twice as much as CenturyLink and am barely getting 0.5% of the same upload speeds (5Mbps compared to &gt;900Mbps with CL). 

I understand everything going on but am very frustrated and have started tethering to my phone for conference calls as AT&amp;Ts up-link is significantly faster as well. 

Thank you Comcast and all their technicians out there doing their jobs and I don't want this to come off as a complaint but I would like some help!"

So, I left it alone until I checked the outage center again several hours later where I found out that both were taken care of.

I checked all my devices and the internet was still connecting and then quickly disconnecting seconds later. I immediately disconnected the power to my CM1000 modem for several minutes and reconnected it to find the problem still there. I then immediately disconnected the ethernet cable going to the router and plugged it in directly to my personal laptop. I found that the same issue persisted on a direct connection to the modem. From there I tried reseting the modem from the online Xfinity Service Center, but found out that the website could not find the modem under my account. It would take several minutes and refreshes for the website to find the modem and then tell me that the modem was experiencing issues.

After that I went to call Xfinity phone support where they could find no problems on their end. So, I went to the event log and found out several events of the same name with just one change would occur every couple of seconds. Event Type Code would either be 16, 20, 22, or 24. Everything else would be exactly the same. 

Copied and pasted from CM1000 modem with redacted MAC addresses - 

CM-STATUS message sent. Event Type Code: 24; Chan ID: 48; DSID: N/A; MAC Addr: N/A; OFDM/OFDMA Profile ID: 0.;CM-MAC=(REDACTED);CMTS-MAC=(REDACTED);CM-QOS=1.1;CM-VER=3.1

If someone could please help, that would be great.

Thanks,

2020-04-06 12:51:49,Comcast_Xfinity,"Building internet outage, can't reach XFinity support via phone","I've been checking with the neighbors, and service is sporadic for the  entire building this morning. Some sites work (like this XFinity forums), others  don't (like XFinity's outage map). I'm currently using a TMobile hotspot for this message, because Reddit doesn't connect either.

https://www.xfinity.com/support/status  and [https://www.xfinity.com/support/status-map](https://www.xfinity.com/support/status-map) will not load. 

I've manually restarted the modem twice today (unplug, wait 30 seconds, plug in).

I tried calling and working through the automated system to get to an  agent. The system wanted to do a modem reset (wouldn't let me proceed  otherwise), so I did that. It then said that I had to wait 10 minutes to  speak to an agent. I called back, and it put me on hold saying the  reset was still in progress. Then it hung up on me.

I called back a few minutes later and it said I couldn't speak to an  agent until I did a reset. Which it just did. Doesn't seem to be ANY way  I can speak with someone to schedule a tech visit.

Could really use some help from XFinity. How can I go about getting a callback?"
2020-04-04 15:25:26,Comcast_Xfinity,"TV Service Scrambled, Internet Wonderful - Anything I Can Do Myself?","Greetings Reddit. The TL;DR of this post is to talk about an issue I'm having with my service and specifically if there is anything I could attempt doing myself due to the state of the world, as no technician is willing to come to my house to look at the issue until May.

My Internet service is WONDERFUL right now. Fast speeds, stable connection, etc. It's great. I don't want to do anything to mess that up - I've actually been WFH since 2006 so nothing in my day job has changed for me.

However, Thursday evening, my TV service went out. I have two TiVo's, so I don't have any X1 boxes. I either get no signal on most channels, or some channels give me enough of a signal that my TiVo tries to process it, but it's extremely pixelated. The two TiVo's are in different parts of the house, and the only splitter that goes to them is the one on the outside of the house - there are no additional splitters and there is no other device (such as a DVD player, etc) in between the wall and the TiVo. The splitter outside of the house also splits out to my cable modem, which is working fabulously with no issues.

I spoke with a tech on the phone (who must be very stressed and I was very nice to him) who ran through the limited diagnostics they can do with CableCARD units and had me power cycle the TiVo. He then agreed that the problem is outside of my house and wanted to send a tech out, however after 30 minutes of trying, he could not get an appointment. I called back today to a different tech (who is also most likely very stressed out and I was very nice to her) who booked me for the first available appointment - May 4th at 8AM. It was explained to me that since this is only a partial outage, it is not important at this time to fix.

So, the question is, is there anything I can do outside my house to possibly fix this without damaging my internet, or am I just stuck without TV service for a month (while still paying for it)? I am not sure of any neighbors that haven't cut the cord so I'm not sure if this is a problem with our street or just with my house."

2020-03-29 21:42:24,Comcast_Xfinity,Cannot connect new third party modem/router,"I have internet service through Comcast/Xfinity, and a rented modem (CISCO DPC3941T). I was on the 250mb plan with boost and on Friday I bought a Netgear Nighthawk X4s Ac3200 wifi cable modem router and upgraded my service to the 1gb plan. When I checked out, the plan included Flex, which I assume is for TV, but I don't have a TV, but it was still cheaper than internet alone, so that's fine. I set up my new modem, followed all the instructions and got an error message: ""Sorry that didn't go as planned"" when I went to register my modem (on [register.xfinity.com](https://register.xfinity.com)).   


When I try to get tech support, I just get a message that there's an outage in my area, but I know there isn't because I put my old modem back and everything works. 

I checked my account and it says that the new service order is pending, and my activation kit for the TV is on the way (again, whatever on that). 

Do you think that 1) my modem doesn't work because my new order is pending and if so, why haven't they set it up yet? 2) it has something to do with the install kit for the TV that hasn't arrived yet? 3) there's some other setting that is wrong with my modem? 

I checked the compatible modems and the Netgear C7800 is listed as a compatible model. That number is listed in fine print in the details of my modem, but not anywhere on the box. 

Another note, I renamed my new network to match my old one. I figure there's a small chance that messed things up, but unlikely. Any help appreciated."

2020-03-27 20:22:14,Comcast_Xfinity,Outage said it would be fixed by yesterday. Any way to get updates?,"I've been unable to work because I have a desktop that isnt able to connect to a nearby xfinity hotspot. I signed up for alerts and updates for fixes, and the status update text said it would be fixed by 3:40pm march 26, and it still hasn't been fixed. My download speeds are 75% of what my package, so it's understandable during this time when traffic is heavy, but my upload speeds are 0.01 Mbps and requests just time out before they receive data input from my side. This is impairing both my ability to work the past two days and for my family to use the internet heading into the weekend. Is there any way to see more granular updates or request to even just alleviate the problem a little bit? Apparently there was regularly scheduled maintenance earlier this week, but that seems to have made things much worse. I would love to but I'm not able to upload things from my desktop currently."
2020-03-27 20:06:47,Comcast_Xfinity,Internet disconnects for ~10s randomly but up to every 5 minutes at times,"This problem started about three weeks ago when Comcast installed fiber in the neighborhood. The actual construction started ~2 months ago, but I was only told there'd be an outage on the 5th or 7th (I can't remember which). As far as I could tell, the entire installation process finished in ~5 days around the beginning of the month and the only ""work"" in the neighborhood I see are spots where slabs of concrete for the sidewalk need to be re-poured.

I tried calling and that only lead to repetitive resetting of my modem and to have a tech come out (two weeks ago now). The tech replaced the entire cable from the little utility box out in the yard all the way to the modem. The modem showed massively improved numbers (from [this](https://i.imgur.com/acW28Jq.png) to [this](https://i.imgur.com/IYOkAan.png)). But this did not solve the issue, and a week later I had another tech come out (the line was buried several days after the first tech) and he checked everything and said that it was most likely something being worked on in the neighborhood.

It has been another week and there still has been no improvement, and now it is practically impossible to get through to support on the phone thanks to covid, and actually impossible to reach support through the ""chat"" on the xfinity site.

About the actual issue, just as the title said, I get a complete disconnect for ~10s pretty randomly. I've had it as few times as once every couple hours to as often as once every 5 minutes for an hour. My computer doesn't see the loss of internet and my modem's LEDs don't show a loss either, but a traceroute and ping to every hop shows everything after my router and modem as unreachable. [They show up like this](https://i.imgur.com/Rl2uMXM.png) in pingtracer, and the only other notable thing from pingtracer is that there is usually one hop listed right after my router that doesn't respond to any pings and gets removed after a few seconds. In that image, it would have been the second row, the first being my router, and the third being what is shown in the second row there.

The modem's log only shows:

Fri Mar 27 14:25:59 2020 | Critical (3) | Started Unicast Maintenance Ranging - No Response received - T3 time-out;CM-MAC=\*\*\*\*;CMTS-MAC=\*\*\*\*;CM-QOS=1.1;CM-VER=3.0;
---|----|----

but not nearly as often and not at the times I lose connection. I've tried connecting my computer directly to the modem with no change in results. I'm out of ideas that I think would make sense.

The disconnects are enough to break IRC, twitch streams and chat, kicks me back to the title screen in the division 2, forces a host migration in warframe (even though I can somehow remain connected to someone with a 30s ping at times). It's making my attempts at trying to have a non-terrible time during this quarantine difficult."

I spent hours on the phone with Advanced Support and was told they are ""working on it"" but don't have real ETA.  Since we're working from home now, this is obviously not helpful.  We're also not in an area with any other ISP options so switching providers is not possible.

2020-03-19 19:08:41,Comcast_Xfinity,Continuing sporadic connectivity outages,"The WAN side of my connection continuously drops at random intervals. These outages occur at least three times a day and can last from 10 minutes or until I reset the modem. These outages also affect our voice line. I have spoken with multiple tech support agents, had a technician visit, and exchanged my modem for a replacement at the local Xfinity store. This morning, Thursday, March 19, beginning at 0200, my connectivity began dropping more frequently. While on the phone with a tech, I explain I can maintain connectivity to the modem and check the status and logs, but outside connectivity ceases. I explain that I have constant pings from a laptop going to the XFINITY modem, as well as DNS servers at Comcast, Google, and Verizon. I tell the technician that only the pings to the outside world drop, not the ping to 10.0.0.1. I tell them that when I log into the modem during an outage, the XFINITY Network box shows an IP of 0.0.0.0. After hearing all of this, the agent keeps referencing the wireless in my house, performing modem resets, and asking where I am in the house when the connection drops. These are pointless questions or tasks as I have explained the problem is a WAN not LAN issue. The technician here a couple of weeks ago changed all cable ends at the modem, dmarc, and box on the street. He stated they test out fine. My current SNR is 40.366287 - 40.946209, Power Level is 47.270599 - 48.270599. Additionally, these entries in the Event Log are repeated at each outage: ti_dhcp6c[14894]: 72001011-DHCPv6 - Missing Required Option 82 and ti_dhcp6c[14894]: 72001011-DHCPv6 - Missing Required Option 24.

2020-03-19 04:28:50,Comcast_Xfinity,Outages and Positive outcomes.,"With everyone being forced to work from home it has taken a toll on our local networks. For my side gig I work as a video editor and I have a home server to manage all of my content and media. I have tools and logs to monitor network performance and this last week I have seen how ill prepared comcast was in the consumer front. For years I've been trying to convince reps to increase my upload speed without having to fork up for true gigabit up and down, which requires a business connection/installation fee in my area. 

Now with this pandemic happening my 10 Mbps up has turned into 1 Mbps up on a good hour. I noticed there was an outage the first night and poked around online to see if other people had noticed it being slow but not down. I saw one post about it and figured eh maybe its just me. 

Its been almost a week now and everything is still all funky but today it was really bad. I looked again and what do you know still reporting outages. I decided to call in. Here is my experience. 

A few things about dealing with customer support. They are used to people calling in complaining like they are speaking directly to the ""big mean CEO of comcast."" In reality they're speaking to a person paid $10 an hour or less.  So be nice. Hell be apologetic. Maybe you'll make their day by just being nice. 

Anyways I called in and was told there was a 30 minute wait due to outages and higher than normal caller volume. When someone answered I said hey sorry to bother you I know you're probably swamped right now so I am just going to say everything you need to hear and get off the phone. My name is... I live here... and I have been affected by the outage and I want a credit to my account. The rep said thank you verified my info and said he'd be happy to give me a credit. He asked me if there was anything else and I decided today would be a good day to ask as any so I said. Is there anything I can do to get a higher upload speed without breaking the bank. In about 3 minutes I had 1000 up 35 down for cheaper than I paid before for $50 less. 

This made me realize now is the time to see about upgrades. If you're like me and can use as much upload as download now is the time to show ISPs we want it. They are going to be forced to upgrade networks by demand and if we don't push them for more upload we are not going to see a better package for it anytime soon."

2020-03-03 00:14:15,Comcast_Xfinity,Internet speeds not matching my purchased service tier,"I recently upgraded my my internet tier to 600/20 (I was told on the sales call it would match the 25 up I had before, but I've since been told it's actually only 20 up.) I received a XB6-A saturday, and went through activation yesterday, and configured the gateway for bridge mode. When we finally got through activation, I found I was only getting approx 240/24 - this is pretty much the same speeds I got on my previous service level. This morning my service went down. I rebooted both the router and modem, then had to leave for work. Internet never came back up. When I got home, I called service and did all the standard troubleshooting. Eventually the tech told me that everything was fine on the modem, and it must be my equipment. After I hung up, I did a factory reset on the modem, reconfigured it, and now everything is back up. However, I'm still only getting about 240/23 or so. (Including on Comcast's speed test.)

My network setup is XB6-A -&gt; Meraki MX64 -&gt; Unifi 16port POE switch -&gt; Multiple Unifi NanoHD (1/floor). On wifi I get typical link speeds of &gt;1Gb to my macbook (currently hovering between 1170-1300Mb), and internal iperf testing shows throughput well past the 600Mb I should be getting from Comcast. I've also tried speed testing from ethernet, and directly from the router, with similar results to above. I've used this exact configuration with an owned modem for several months with 0 issues, until I got the new gateway. 

Could I be mis-provisioned? I asked the techs multiple times on the phone, but they said my provisioning is correct, and that I need to wait for the signal to ""settle down"", but it seems like over 24 hours should be enough time? I also found some posts saying this gateway has issues, and the extended outage this morning doesn't reassure me. I read the XB6-T is better, should I try to get one of those?"

2020-02-25 00:17:31,Comcast_Xfinity,Comcast clown rodeo,"I had perfect service with comcast up until today. I moved into a new apartment in July 2019 and Xfinity was the only internet that was offered in my apartment complex. I signed up for a promotion and was happy with my service. I legit only remember one instance of an outage and had no complaints.
Today (2/24) my respect for comcast fell completely to zero. I got a call around 4pm informing me that my promotion had ended and my rate would be going up $15.00. This is fine as I understand that promotional rates do come to an end. After the call I returned home to find that none of my devices were connected to the internet. I unplug and replug my router server all times to no avail. I figured there was just an outtage. I open my Xfinity My Account app to check on my Gateway and it seems my gateway name was changed. My first guess was that since I signed a new service agreement that the Wifi network name might’ve changed. I chatted with someone on the app to have my network name and password changed. They changed it back to what I had it to. The ethernet on my desktop was working great by I noticed the wifi on my phone and laptop was dreadfully slow. I went to check the app again and discovered that there were 12 devices on my network that I’d never heard of. I was worried that someone had hacked my Gateway and was bumming wifi off of me. I got back on the app to chat to figure out what was going on. After chatting with two agents via text and one overseas support on the phone I still have no answers on wtf is going on. I resorted to unplugging the power and coaxil cable on my gateway and hoping that someone state side can help me tomorrow. 
My suspicion is that one of two things have happened: 1) upon renewing my service agreement today the agent criss crossed my gateway with someone else in the building and merged our gateways. The plan I was on was maxed out at 100mbps download and when I tested my hardwire connection on my desktop my download speed was almost 500mbps which leads me to believe someone in my building is paying for that speed and our service is now intertwined. OR 2) somehow in the few hours I was gone after my service renewal call someone got into my gateway and changed the name and password and logged a bunch of devices into it. 

Regardless of what’s going on I am now worried that my credit cards and logins may have been skimmed and have lost any faith I previously had in Comcast."

In October, I had an outage and called to report it to Xfinity, a technician was supposed to come the next day, but instead I got a call from support saying they were able to repair the problem on their end. I suspect this may have something to do with the overage, but I'm not sure.

An official Comcast Employee made this post in that thread: 
&gt; &gt;**UPDATE 12/04/2019**

&gt; **ORIGINAL MESSAGE 10/09/2019**
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Apologies all for the issue and the experience that many have described above. Thanks for posting many details here, that was very helpful in having our teams research this issue.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; While updating our data usage meter to a new system, a software error occurred resulting in a small number of our customers being billed incorrectly.
&gt; 
&gt; We're very sorry for inconveniencing our customers and here's what we're doing to address it: We fixed the technical issue, we're proactively crediting the accounts affected, and we're giving those customers an additional $50 credit to make it right.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Impacted customers have been identified.  We are working to identify customers that may have purchased xFi or unlimited data as a direct result of this error.  

I called the CSA and got no help and was even told there is no suh thing as a Customer Security Assurance team. I'm not sure if I have any other options.
 All I really want is a courtesy month restored."

2020-01-25 18:24:50,Comcast_Xfinity,"Help, internet not working properly","Today my internet has been acting retarded, it's been blocking every single site and servers.
Can't use my ps4, can't use steam, can't use blizzard and basically majority of softwares that requires internet n websites.
Is there an outage or something?"
2020-01-21 19:31:39,Comcast_Xfinity,"Comcast outage yesterday. Outage is officially fixed, but I still have no internet. Modem shows 1 downstream channel locked but upstream says Access Denied. Support ignores what I say and asks about lights on unit. Any advice?","I'm a bit frustrated that the support people follow the script assuming people can't log into their modems and see diagnostic info. I see access Denied, as well as my upstream channel listing showing one channel operating at 57 dBmV, which I believe is too high. I feel like the outage yesterday wasn't 100% fixed or something. Anyone have ideas for what's actually wrong?"
2020-01-19 19:17:41,Comcast_Xfinity,Internet outage,"Hi,

Wanted to report an internet outage in Chicago. Is anyone else experiencing any issues? I got off the phone with tech support who says there hasn't been any outages in my area yet when I go on their site and check the outage map it's red in my area and says 51-500 subscribers affected. I'm asking people around a bit further away from area and they don't seem to have any issues. Any ideas? They said they'd send out a technician Tuesday but that's too long a wait for me."
2020-01-19 09:07:11,Comcast_Xfinity,Possible reasons for no connection?,I was on the internet last night when it went out randomly. I checked the status page and it says there is no outage in my area. I have restarted the router and it just won't go online. I simply cannot afford to pay for a $60 tech visit and I will just switch to att if that's my only option. Anything I can do before cancelling to try to get the internet back on without a tech coming out?
2020-01-15 17:45:03,Comcast_Xfinity,Comcast 5G Wifi Issues,"For about a month now I have been having connection issues with my 5G Comcast wifi. I have noticed it on both my PC and phone. We've lived in this place about 4 months before this with no issues. The 2.4G doesnt have connection issues, but is much slower than the 5G.

One note is there was a power outage around the time this started. I cant say for sure if it happened at the same time, but figured it was worth mentioning. 

Phone: My phone will randomly disconnect from the 5G wifi. When I go to the Wifi settings, it lists the wifi in the Available Networks, but says internet not available (can be seen in picture). I click it and it will reconnect. If I have our 2.4G signal on my phone too, it will connect to that after it disconnects from the 5G.

PC: PC does the same thing where it randomly will disconnect from the 5G and will join the 2.4G instead. Also, when I am connected to 5G, it is much slower than it used to be when playing games. I play League of Legends, and my ping used to be 55-65, now it's about 65-95, which is enough to make it difficult to play.

My router is a Netgear N600 Wifi Cable Modem Router Model: C3700. I can provide more info if needed. I have tried turning it off for a few minutes, unplugging it, and have checked all cable connections. I've also forgot and reconnected to the network on all my devices.

Any help is appreciated and I can give more information if it's needed."
2020-01-07 09:49:34,Comcast_Xfinity,Hey I have an outage. Can someone provide any info other than the xfinity.com/outage.,[removed]
2020-01-06 15:53:13,Comcast_Xfinity,Outage! Sure would be nice if I could get a text when it’s restored so I don’t have to keep testing for the next three hours.,
2020-01-03 10:05:29,Comcast_Xfinity,"I work from home and for the past 4 months have had constant internet drops, what can I do?","I have had Comcast for 6 years for just internet. No problems what so ever. About 4 months ago, I have started getting constant outages. My first thought, every time, was to check the outage map to make sure it's not a local issue in my network.

I had a total of 27 outages ranging from 5 - 30 mins each for that month. I finally called and complained. After calling 3 times finally someone acknowledged my issue and gave me a 20 dollar credit. It kept happening but not as bad. Now 4 months later I am typing this up because it continues and is a pain in my butt. Everytime it happens, I verify that it's a tech working on the line and not my network. 

Is there anything I can do other than pester them for a discount. I would like someone to review the outages and follow up on something?"
